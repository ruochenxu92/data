	{'abstract': u"This paper studies the problem of testing if an input (Gamma,*), where Gamma is a finite set of unknown size and * is a binary operation over Gamma given as an oracle, is close to a specified class of groups. Friedl et al. [Efficient testing of groups, STOC'05] have constructed an efficient tester using poly(log|Gamma|) queries for the class of abelian groups. We focus in this paper on subclasses of abelian groups, and show that these problems are much harder: Omega(|Gamma|^) queries are necessary to test if the input is close to a cyclic group, and Omega(|Gamma|^c) queries for some constant c are necessary to test more generally if the input is close to an abelian group generated by k elements, for any fixed integer k&gt;0. We also show that knowledge of the size of the ground set Gamma helps only for k=1, in which case we construct an efficient tester using poly(log|Gamma|) queries; for any other value k&gt;1 the query complexity remains Omega(|Gamma|^c). All our upper and lower bounds hold for both the edit distance and the Hamming distance. These are, to the best of our knowledge, the first nontrivial lower bounds for such group-theoretic problems in the property testing model and, in particular, they imply the first exponential separations between the classical and quantum query complexities of testing closeness to classes of groups.",

	{'abstract': u'Recent Microsoft security bulletins show that kernel vulnerabilities are becoming more and more important security threats. Despite the pretty extensive security mitigations many of the kernel vulnerabilities are still exploitable. Successful kernel exploitation typically grants the attacker maximum privilege level and results in total machine compromise. To protect against kernel exploitation, we have developed a tool which statically rewrites the Microsoft Windows kernel as well as other kernel level modules. Such rewritten binary files allow us to monitor control flow transfers during operating system execution. At this point we are able to detect whether selected control transfer flow is valid or should be considered as an attack attempt. Our solution is especially directed towards preventing remote kernel exploitation attempts. Additionally, many of the local privilege escalation attacks are also blocked (also due to additional mitigation techniques we have implemented). Our tool was tested with Microsoft Windows XP, Windows Vista and Windows 7 (under both virtual and physical machines) on IA-32 compatible processors. Our apparatus is also completely standalone and does not require any third party software.',

	{'abstract': u'Unions of graph Fourier multipliers are an important class of linear operators for processing signals defined on graphs. We present a novel method to efficiently distribute the application of these operators to the high-dimensional signals collected by sensor networks. The proposed method features approximations of the graph Fourier multipliers by shifted Chebyshev polynomials, whose recurrence relations make them readily amenable to distributed computation. We demonstrate how the proposed method can be used in a distributed denoising task, and show that the communication requirements of the method scale gracefully with the size of the network.',

For some classes of codes the bound on the minimum distance is refined. Furthermore, a quadratic-time decoding algorithm up to this new bound is developed. The determination of the error locations is based on the Euclidean Algorithm and a modified Chien search. The error evaluation is done by solving a generalization of Forney's formula.",

Fourteen variants of DE were implemented and tested on fourteen benchmark problems for dimensions of 30. The competitiveness of the variants are identified by the Mean Objective Function value, they achieved in 100 runs. The convergence nature of the best and worst performing variants are analyzed by measuring their Convergence Speed (Cs) and Quality Measure (Qm).',

	{'abstract': u'The World Wide Web no longer consists just of HTML pages. Our work sheds light on a number of trends on the Internet that go beyond simple Web pages. The hidden Web provides a wealth of data in semi-structured form, accessible through Web forms and Web services. These services, as well as numerous other applications on the Web, commonly use XML, the eXtensible Markup Language. XML has become the lingua franca of the Internet that allows customized markups to be defined for specific domains. On top of XML, the Semantic Web grows as a common structured data source. In this work, we first explain each of these developments in detail. Using real-world examples from scientific domains of great interest today, we then demonstrate how these new developments can assist the managing, harvesting, and organization of data on the Web. On the way, we also illustrate the current research avenues in these domains. We believe that this effort would help bridge multiple database tracks, thereby attracting researchers with a view to extend database technology.',

These new research avenues become evident, for example, in the topics that doctoral students choose for their dissertations. This paper surveys the emerging multidisciplinary research by doctoral students in database systems and related areas. It is based on the PIKM 2010, which is the 3rd Ph.D. workshop at the International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management (CIKM). The topics addressed include ontology development, data streams, natural language processing, medical databases, green energy, cloud computing, and exploratory search. In addition to core ideas from the workshop, we list some open research questions in these multidisciplinary areas.',

	{'abstract': u'In recent years, the data mining techniques have met a serious challenge due to the increased concerning and worries of the privacy, that is, protecting the privacy of the critical and sensitive data. Different techniques and algorithms have been already presented for Privacy Preserving data mining, which could be classified in three common approaches: Data modification approach, Data sanitization approach and Secure Multi-party Computation approach. This paper presents a Data modification- based Framework for classification and evaluation of the privacy preserving data mining techniques. Based on our framework the techniques are divided into two major groups, namely perturbation approach and anonymization approach. Also in proposed framework, eight functional criteria will be used to analyze and analogically assessment of the techniques in these two major groups. The proposed framework provides a good basis for more accurate comparison of the given techniques to privacy preserving data mining. In addition, this framework allows recognizing the overlapping amount for different approaches and identifying modern approaches in this field.',

	{'abstract': u'Statistical dependencies among wavelet coefficients are commonly represented by graphical models such as hidden Markov trees(HMTs). However, in linear inverse problems such as deconvolution, tomography, and compressed sensing, the presence of a sensing or observation matrix produces a linear mixing of the simple Markovian dependency structure. This leads to reconstruction problems that are non-convex optimizations. Past work has dealt with this issue by resorting to greedy or suboptimal iterative reconstruction methods. In this paper, we propose new modeling approaches based on group-sparsity penalties that leads to convex optimizations that can be solved exactly and efficiently. We show that the methods we develop perform significantly better in deconvolution and compressed sensing applications, while being as computationally efficient as standard coefficient-wise approaches such as lasso.',

	{'abstract': u"We study the asymptotic performance of two multi-hop overlaid ad-hoc networks that utilize the same temporal, spectral, and spatial resources based on random access schemes. The primary network consists of Poisson distributed legacy users with density lambda^ and the secondary network consists of Poisson distributed cognitive radio users with density lambda^ = ( lambda^)^ ( beta&gt;0, beta neq 1) that utilize the spectrum opportunistically. Both networks are decentralized and employ ALOHA medium access protocols where the secondary nodes are additionally equipped with range-limited perfect spectrum sensors to monitor and protect primary transmissions. We study the problem in two distinct regimes, namely beta&gt;1 and 0&lt; beta&lt;1. We show that in both cases, the two networks can achieve their corresponding stand-alone throughput scaling even without secondary spectrum sensing (i.e., the sensing range set to zero); this implies the need for a more comprehensive performance metric than just throughput scaling to evaluate the influence of the overlaid interactions. We thus introduce a new criterion, termed the asymptotic multiplexing gain, which captures the effect of inter-network interferences with different spectrum sensing setups. With this metric, we clearly demonstrate that spectrum sensing can substantially improve primary network performance when beta&gt;1. On the contrary, spectrum sensing turns out to be unnecessary when beta&lt;1 and setting the secondary network's ALOHA parameter appropriately can substantially improve primary network performance.",

	{'abstract': u"As the Distributed Collection Manager's work on building tools to support users maintaining collections of changing web-based resources has progressed, questions about the characteristics of people's collections of web pages have arisen. Simultaneously, work in the areas of social bookmarking, social news, and subscription-based technologies have been taking the existence, usage, and utility of this data for granted with neither investigation into what people are doing with their collections nor how they are trying to maintain them. In order to address these concerns, we performed an online user study of 125 individuals from a variety of online and offline communities, such as the reddit social news user community and the graduate student body in our department. From this study we were able to examine a user's needs for a system to manage their web-based distributed collections, how their current tools affect their ability to maintain their collections, and what the characteristics of their current practices and problems in maintaining their web-based collections were. We also present extensions and improvements being made to the system both in order to adapt DCM for usage in the Ensemble project and to meet the requirements found by our user study.",

	{'abstract': u'This paper proposes a form of MPC in which the control variables are moved asynchronously. This contrasts with most MIMO control schemes, which assume that all variables are updated simultaneously. MPC outperforms other control strategies through its ability to deal with constraints. This requires on-line optimization, hence computational complexity can become an issue when applying MPC to complex systems with fast response times. The multiplexed MPC scheme described in this paper solves the MPC problem for each subsystem sequentially, and updates subsystem controls as soon as the solution is available, thus distributing the control moves over a complete update cycle. The resulting computational speed-up allows faster response to disturbances, which may result in improved performance, despite finding sub-optimal solutions to the original problem.',

	{'abstract': u"Spectrum sensing receives much attention recently in the cognitive radio (CR) network research, i.e., secondary users (SUs) constantly monitor channel condition to detect the presence of the primary users (PUs). In this paper, we go beyond spectrum sensing and introduce the PU separation problem, which concerns with the issues of distinguishing and characterizing PUs in the context of collaborative spectrum sensing and monitor selection. The observations of monitors are modeled as boolean OR mixtures of underlying binary sources for PUs. We first justify the use of the binary OR mixture model as opposed to the traditional linear mixture model through simulation studies. Then we devise a novel binary inference algorithm for PU separation. Not only PU-SU relationship are revealed, but PUs' transmission statistics and activities at each time slot can also be inferred. Simulation results show that without any prior knowledge regarding PUs' activities, the algorithm achieves high inference accuracy even in the presence of noisy measurements.",

	{'abstract': u"Initial Semantics aims at characterizing the syntax associated to a signature as the initial object of some category. We present an initial semantics result for typed higher-order syntax together with its formalization in the Coq proof assistant. The main theorem was first proved on paper in the second author's PhD thesis in 2010, and verified formally shortly afterwards. To a simply-typed binding signature S over a fixed set T of object types we associate a category called the category of representations of S. We show that this category has an initial object Sigma(S). From its construction it will be clear that the object Sigma(S) merits the name abstract syntax associated to S. Our theorem is implemented and proved correct in the proof assistant Coq through heavy use of dependent types. The approach through monads gives rise to an implementation of syntax where both terms and variables are intrinsically typed, i.e. where the object types are reflected in the meta-level types. This article is to be seen as a research article rather than about the formalization of a classical mathematical result. The nature of our theorem - involving lengthy, technical proofs and complicated algebraic structures - makes it particularly interesting for formal verification. Our goal is to promote the use of computer theorem provers as research tools, and, accordingly, a new way of publishing mathematical results: a parallel description of a theorem and its formalization should allow the verification of correct transcription of definitions and statements into the proof assistant, and straightforward but technical proofs should be well-hidden in a digital library. We argue that Coq's rich type theory, combined with its various features such as implicit arguments, allows a particularly readable formalization and is hence well-suited for communicating mathematics.",

	{'abstract': u"This paper studies the problem of neighbor discovery in wireless networks, namely, each node wishes to discover and identify the network interface addresses (NIAs) of those nodes within a single hop. A novel paradigm, called compressed neighbor discovery is proposed, which enables all nodes to simultaneously discover their respective neighborhoods with a single frame of transmission, which is typically of a few thousand symbol epochs. The key technique is to assign each node a unique on-off signature and let all nodes simultaneously transmit their signatures. Despite that the radios are half-duplex, each node observes a superposition of its neighbors' signatures (partially) through its own off-slots. To identify its neighbors out of a large network address space, each node solves a compressed sensing (or sparse recovery) problem. Two practical schemes are studied. The first employs random on-off signatures, and each node discovers its neighbors using a noncoherent detection algorithm based on group testing. The second scheme uses on-off signatures based on a deterministic second-order Reed-Muller code, and applies a chirp decoding algorithm. The second scheme needs much lower signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) to achieve the same error performance. The complexity of the chirp decoding algorithm is sub-linear, so that it is in principle scalable to networks with billions of nodes with 48-bit IEEE 802.11 MAC addresses. The compressed neighbor discovery schemes are much more efficient than conventional random-access discovery, where nodes have to retransmit over many frames with random delays to be successfully discovered.",

	{'abstract': u'In this paper, we demonstrate some applications of compressive sensing over networks. We make a connection between compressive sensing and traditional information theoretic techniques in source coding and channel coding. Our results provide an explicit trade-off between the rate and the decoding complexity. The key difference of compressive sensing and traditional information theoretic approaches is at their decoding side. Although optimal decoders to recover the original signal, compressed by source coding have high complexity, the compressive sensing decoder is a linear or convex optimization. First, we investigate applications of compressive sensing on distributed compression of correlated sources. Here, by using compressive sensing, we propose a compression scheme for a family of correlated sources with a modularized decoder, providing a trade-off between the compression rate and the decoding complexity. We call this scheme Sparse Distributed Compression. We use this compression scheme for a general multicast network with correlated sources. Here, we first decode some of the sources by a network decoding technique and then, we use a compressive sensing decoder to obtain the whole sources. Then, we investigate applications of compressive sensing on channel coding. We propose a coding scheme that combines compressive sensing and random channel coding for a high-SNR point-to-point Gaussian channel. We call this scheme Sparse Channel Coding. We propose a modularized decoder providing a trade-off between the capacity loss and the decoding complexity. At the receiver side, first, we use a compressive sensing decoder on a noisy signal to obtain a noisy estimate of the original signal and then, we apply a traditional channel coding decoder to find the original signal.',

	{'abstract': u'In practical applications, machine learning algorithms are often needed to learn classifiers that optimize domain specific performance measures. Previously, the research has focused on learning the needed classifier in isolation, yet learning nonlinear classifier for nonlinear and nonsmooth performance measures is still hard. In this paper, rather than learning the needed classifier by optimizing specific performance measure directly, we circumvent this problem by proposing a novel two-step approach called as CAPO, namely to first train nonlinear auxiliary classifiers with existing learning methods, and then to adapt auxiliary classifiers for specific performance measures. In the first step, auxiliary classifiers can be obtained efficiently by taking off-the-shelf learning algorithms. For the second step, we show that the classifier adaptation problem can be reduced to a quadratic program problem, which is similar to linear SVMperf and can be efficiently solved. By exploiting nonlinear auxiliary classifiers, CAPO can generate nonlinear classifier which optimizes a large variety of performance measures including all the performance measure based on the contingency table and AUC, whilst keeping high computational efficiency. Empirical studies show that CAPO is effective and of high computational efficiency, and even it is more efficient than linear SVMperf.',

	{'abstract': u'Wide implementation of IEEE 802.11 based networks could lead to deployment of localized wireless data communication environments with a limited number of mobile hosts, called ad hoc networks. Implementation of a proper routing methodology in ad hoc networks makes it efficient in terms of performance. A wide spectrum of routing protocols has been contributed by several researchers. Real time applications have been most popular among the applications, run by ad hoc networks. Such applications strictly adhere to the Quality of Service (QoS) requirements such as overall throughput, end-toend delay and power level. Support of QoS requirements becomes more challenging due to dynamic nature of MANETs, where mobility of nodes results in frequent change in topology. QoS aware routing protocols can serve to the QoS support, which concentrate on determining a path between source and destination with the QoS requirements of the flow being satisfied. We propose a protocol, called Power and Delay aware Temporally Ordered Routing Algorithm (PDTORA), based on Temporally Ordered Routing Algorithm (TORA) Protocol, where verification of power and delay requirements is carried out with a query packet at each node along the path between source and destination. Simulations justify better performance of the proposed new protocol in terms of network lifetime, end-to-end delay and packet delivery ratio as compared to TORA.',

	{'abstract': u"The use of domain knowledge is generally found to improve query efficiency in content filtering applications. In particular, tangible benefits have been achieved when using knowledge-based approaches within more specialized fields, such as medical free texts or legal documents. However, the problem is that sources of domain knowledge are time-consuming to build and equally costly to maintain. As a potential remedy, recent studies on Wikipedia suggest that this large body of socially constructed knowledge can be effectively harnessed to provide not only facts but also accurate information about semantic concept-similarities. This paper describes a framework for document filtering, where Wikipedia's concept-relatedness information is combined with a domain ontology to produce semantic content classifiers. The approach is evaluated using Reuters RCV1 corpus and TREC-11 filtering task definitions. In a comparative study, the approach shows robust performance and appears to outperform content classifiers based on Support Vector Machines (SVM) and C4.5 algorithm.",

	{'abstract': u'Most of the existing information retrieval systems are based on bag of words model and are not equipped with common world knowledge. Work has been done towards improving the efficiency of such systems by using intelligent algorithms to generate search queries, however, not much research has been done in the direction of incorporating human-and-society level knowledge in the queries. This paper is one of the first attempts where such information is incorporated into the search queries using Wikipedia semantics. The paper presents an essential shift from conventional token based queries to concept based queries, leading to an enhanced efficiency of information retrieval systems. To efficiently handle the automated query learning problem, we propose Wikipedia-based Evolutionary Semantics (Wiki-ES) framework where concept based queries are learnt using a co-evolving evolutionary procedure. Learning concept based queries using an intelligent evolutionary procedure yields significant improvement in performance which is shown through an extensive study using Reuters newswire documents. Comparison of the proposed framework is performed with other information retrieval systems. Concept based approach has also been implemented on other information retrieval systems to justify the effectiveness of a transition from token based queries to concept based queries.',

	{'abstract': u'This paper studies a generalization of multi-prover interactive proofs in which a verifier interacts with two competing teams of provers: one team attempts to convince the verifier to accept while the other attempts to convince the verifier to reject. Each team consists of two provers who jointly implement a no-signaling strategy. No-signaling strategies are a curious class of joint strategy that cannot in general be implemented without communication between the provers, yet cannot be used as a black box to establish communication between them. Attention is restricted in this paper to two-turn interactions in which the verifier asks questions of each of the four provers and decides whether to accept or reject based on their responses. We prove that the complexity class of decision problems that admit two-turn interactive proofs with competing teams of no-signaling provers is a subset of PSPACE. This upper bound matches existing PSPACE lower bounds on the following two disparate and weaker classes of interactive proof: 1. Two-turn multi-prover interactive proofs with only one team of no-signaling provers. 2. Two-turn competing-prover interactive proofs with only one prover per team. Our result implies that the complexity of these two models is unchanged by the addition of a second competing team of no-signaling provers in the first case and by the addition of a second no-signaling prover to each team in the second case. Moreover, our result unifies and subsumes prior PSPACE upper bounds on these classes.',

	{'abstract': u'Many problems in machine learning and statistics can be formulated as (generalized) eigenproblems. In terms of the associated optimization problem, computing linear eigenvectors amounts to finding critical points of a quadratic function subject to quadratic constraints. In this paper we show that a certain class of constrained optimization problems with nonquadratic objective and constraints can be understood as nonlinear eigenproblems. We derive a generalization of the inverse power method which is guaranteed to converge to a nonlinear eigenvector. We apply the inverse power method to 1-spectral clustering and sparse PCA which can naturally be formulated as nonlinear eigenproblems. In both applications we achieve state-of-the-art results in terms of solution quality and runtime. Moving beyond the standard eigenproblem should be useful also in many other applications and our inverse power method can be easily adapted to new problems.',

We show that its output is sometimes incomplete, due to an oversight in its mathematical validation. We propose alternative complete generators and we extend the approach to an existing closure-aware basis similar to, and often smaller than, the representative rules, namely the basis B*.',

	{'abstract': u"We prove the following strong hardness result for learning: Given a distribution of labeled examples from the hypercube such that there exists a monomial consistent with of the examples, it is NP-hard to find a halfspace that is correct on of the examples, for arbitrary constants . In learning theory terms, weak agnostic learning of monomials is hard, even if one is allowed to output a hypothesis from the much bigger concept class of halfspaces. This hardness result subsumes a long line of previous results, including two recent hardness results for the proper learning of monomials and halfspaces. As an immediate corollary of our result we show that weak agnostic learning of decision lists is NP-hard. Our techniques are quite different from previous hardness proofs for learning. We define distributions on positive and negative examples for monomials whose first few moments match. We use the invariance principle to argue that regular halfspaces (all of whose coefficients have small absolute value relative to the total norm) cannot distinguish between distributions whose first few moments match. For highly non-regular subspaces, we use a structural lemma from recent work on fooling halfspaces to argue that they are ``junta-like'' and one can zero out all but the top few coefficients without affecting the performance of the halfspace. The top few coefficients form the natural list decoding of a halfspace in the context of dictatorship tests/Label Cover reductions. We note that unlike previous invariance principle based proofs which are only known to give Unique-Games hardness, we are able to reduce from a version of Label Cover problem that is known to be NP-hard. This has inspired follow-up work on bypassing the Unique Games conjecture in some optimal geometric inapproximability results.",

	{'abstract': u'Malicious mobile phone worms spread between devices via short-range Bluetooth contacts, similar to the propagation of human and other biological viruses. Recent work has employed models from epidemiology and complex networks to analyse the spread of malware and the effect of patching specific nodes. These approaches have adopted a static view of the mobile networks, i.e., by aggregating all the edges that appear over time, which leads to an approximate representation of the real interactions: instead, these networks are inherently dynamic and the edge appearance and disappearance is highly influenced by the ordering of the human contacts, something which is not captured at all by existing complex network measures. In this paper we first study how the blocking of malware propagation through immunisation of key nodes (even if carefully chosen through static or temporal betweenness centrality metrics) is ineffective: this is due to the richness of alternative paths in these networks. Then we introduce a time-aware containment strategy that spreads a patch message starting from nodes with high temporal closeness centrality and show its effectiveness using three real-world datasets. Temporal closeness allows the identification of nodes able to reach most nodes quickly: we show that this scheme can reduce the cellular network resource consumption and associated costs, achieving, at the same time, a complete containment of the malware in a limited amount of time.',

	{'abstract': u'Web query log data contain information useful to research; however, release of such data can re-identify the search engine users issuing the queries. These privacy concerns go far beyond removing explicitly identifying information such as name and address, since non-identifying personal data can be combined with publicly available information to pinpoint to an individual. In this work we model web query logs as unstructured transaction data and present a novel transaction anonymization technique based on clustering and generalization techniques to achieve the k-anonymity privacy. We conduct extensive experiments on the AOL query log data. Our results show that this method results in a higher data utility compared to the state of-the-art transaction anonymization methods.',

	{'abstract': u'This paper considers the problem of finding a quickest path between two points in the Euclidean plane in the presence of a transportation network. A transportation network consists of a planar network where each road (edge) has an individual speed. A traveller may enter and exit the network at any point on the roads. Along any road the traveller moves with a fixed speed depending on the road, and outside the network the traveller moves at unit speed in any direction. We give an exact algorithm for the basic version of the problem: given a transportation network of total complexity n in the Euclidean plane, a source point s and a destination point t, and the quickest path between s and t. We also show how the transportation network can be preprocessed in time O(n^2 log n) into a data structure of size O(n^2) such that (1 + epsilon)-approximate cheapest path cost queries between any two points in the plane can be answered in time O(1 epsilon^4 log n).',

	{'abstract': u'Corporate mail services are designed to perform better than public mail services. Fast mail delivery, large size file transfer as an attachments, high level spam and virus protection, commercial advertisement free environment are some of the advantages worth to mention. But these mail services are frequent target of hackers and spammers. Distributed Denial of service attacks are becoming more common and sophisticated. The researchers have proposed various solutions to the DDOS attacks. Can we stop these kinds of attacks with available technology? These days the DDoS attack through spam has increased and disturbed the mail services of various organizations. Spam penetrates through all the filters to establish DDoS attacks, which causes serious problems to users and the data. In this paper we propose a novel approach to defend DDoS attack caused by spam mails. This approach is a combination of fine tuning of source filters, content filters, strictly implementing mail policies,educating user, network monitoring and logical solutions to the ongoing attack. We have conducted several experiments in corporate mail services; the results show that this approach is highly effective to prevent DDoS attack caused by spam. The novel defense mechanism reduced 60% of the incoming spam traffic and repelled many DDoS attacks caused by spam.',

	{'abstract': u'We present a mathematical connection between channel coding and compressed sensing. In particular, we link, on the one hand, emph, which is a well-known relaxation o maximum-likelihood channel decoding for binary linear codes, and, on the other hand, emph, also known as basis pursuit, which is a widely used linear programming relaxation for the problem of finding the sparsest solution of an under-determined system of linear equations. More specifically, we establis a tight connection between CS-LPD based on a zero-one measurement matrix over the reals and CC-LPD of the binary linear channel code that is obtained by viewing this measurement matrix as a binary parity-check matrix. This connection allows the translation of performance guarantees from one setup to the other. The main message of this paper is that parity-check matrices of "good" channel codes can be used as provably "good" measurement matrices under basis pursuit. In particular, we provide the first deterministic construction of compressed sensing measurement matrices with an order-optimal number of rows using high-girth low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes constructed by Gallager.',

The case of a single relay has been extensively studied in the literature and several techniques to approach the optimum performance have been proposed. Until recently, however, a practical implementation for the case of several relays had been considered to be much more challenging. A rotation-based DDF technique, suitable for any number of relays, has been recently proposed which promises to overcome important implementation hurdles. This article provides an overview of the DDF protocol, describes different implementation techniques and compares their performance.',

Such edges are related to the notion of convex decompositions spanned by S. We prove a worst-case tight lower bound for the number of pseudo-simultaneously flippable edges in a triangulation in terms of the number of vertices. We use this bound for deriving new upper bounds for the maximal number of crossing-free straight-edge graphs that can be embedded on any fixed set of N points in the plane. We obtain new upper bounds for the number of spanning trees and forests as well. Specifically, let tr(N) denote the maximum number of triangulations on a set of N points in the plane. Then we show (using the known bound tr(N) &lt; 30^N) that any N-element point set admits at most 6.9283^N * tr(N) &lt; 207.85^N crossing-free straight-edge graphs, O(4.7022^N) * tr(N) = O(141.07^N) spanning trees, and O(5.3514^N) * tr(N) = O(160.55^N) forests.

LLL can be also used to prove the consistency of an infinite set of conditions, using standard compactness argument (if an infinite set of conditions is inconsistent, then some finite part of it is inconsistent, too, which contradicts LLL). In this way we show that objects satisfying all the conditions do exist (though the probability of this event equals~). However, if we are interested in finding a computable solution that satisfies all the constraints, compactness arguments do not work anymore. Moser and Tardos recently gave a nice constructive proof of LLL. Lance Fortnow asked whether one can apply Moser--Tardos technique to prove the existence of a computable solution.

	{'abstract': u'Motivated by an open problem from graph drawing, we study several partitioning problems for line and hyperplane arrangements. We prove a ham-sandwich cut theorem: given two sets of n lines in R^2, there is a line l such that in both line sets, for both halfplanes delimited by l, there are n^ lines which pairwise intersect in that halfplane, and this bound is tight; a centerpoint theorem: for any set of n lines there is a point such that for any halfplane containing that point there are (n/3)^ of the lines which pairwise intersect in that halfplane. We generalize those results in higher dimension and obtain a center transversal theorem, a same-type lemma, and a positive portion Erdos-Szekeres theorem for hyperplane arrangements. This is done by formulating a generalization of the center transversal theorem which applies to set functions that are much more general than measures. Back to Graph Drawing (and in the plane), we completely solve the open problem that motivated our search: there is no set of n labelled lines that are universal for all n-vertex labelled planar graphs. As a side note, we prove that every set of n (unlabelled) lines is universal for all n-vertex (unlabelled) planar graphs.',

	{'abstract': u'We present an architecture of a hosting system consisting of a set of hosted Web Services subject to QoS constraints, and a certain number of servers used to run users demand. The traffic is session-based, while provider and users agree on SLAs specifying the expected level of service performance such that the service provider is liable to compensate his/her customers if the level of performance is not satisfactory. The system is driven by a utility function which tries to optimize the average earned revenue per unit time. The middleware collects demand and performance statistics, and estimates traffic parameters in order to make dynamic decisions concerning server allocation and admission control. We empirically evaluate the effects of admission policies, resource allocation and service differentiation schemes on the achieved revenues, and we find that our system is robust enough to successfully deal with session-based traffic under different conditions.',

	{'abstract': u"Recommendation systems are emerging as an important business application with significant economic impact. Currently popular systems include Amazon's book recommendations, Netflix's movie recommendations, and Pandora's music recommendations. In this paper we address the problem of estimating probabilities associated with recommendation system data using non-parametric kernel smoothing. In our estimation we interpret missing items as randomly censored observations and obtain efficient computation schemes using combinatorial properties of generating functions. We demonstrate our approach with several case studies involving real world movie recommendation data. The results are comparable with state-of-the-art techniques while also providing probabilistic preference estimates outside the scope of traditional recommender systems.",

	{'abstract': u"In multi-user communication from one base station (BS) to multiple users, the problem of minimizing the transmit power to achieve some target guaranteed performance (rates) at users has been well investigated in the literature. Similarly various user selection algorithms have been proposed and analyzed when the BS has to transmit to a subset of the users in the system, mostly for the objective of the sum rate maximization. We study the joint problem of minimizing the transmit power at the BS to achieve specific signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio (SINR) targets at users in conjunction with user scheduling. The general analytical results for the average transmit power required to meet guaranteed performance at the users' side are difficult to obtain even without user selection due to joint optimization required over beamforming vectors and power allocation scalars. We study the transmit power minimization problem with various user selection algorithms, namely semi-orthogonal user selection (SUS), norm-based user selection (NUS) and angle-based user selection (AUS). When the SINR targets to achieve are relatively large, the average minimum transmit power expressions are derived for NUS and SUS for any number of users. For the special case when only two users are selected, similar expressions are further derived for AUS and a performance upper bound which serves to benchmark the performance of other selection schemes. Simulation results performed under various settings indicate that SUS is by far the better user selection criterion.",

	{'abstract': u'In this paper, a compress-and-forward scheme with backward decoding is presented for the unicast wireless relay network. The encoding at the source and relay is a generalization of the noisy network coding scheme (NNC). While it achieves the same reliable data rate as noisy network coding scheme, the backward decoding allows for a better decoding complexity as compared to the joint decoding of the NNC scheme. Characterizing the layered decoding scheme is shown to be equivalent to characterizing an information flow for the wireless network. A node-flow for a graph with bisubmodular capacity constraints is presented and a max-flow min-cut theorem is proved for it. This generalizes many well-known results of flows over capacity constrained graphs studied in computer science literature. The results for the unicast relay network are generalized to the network with multiple sources with independent messages intended for a single destination.',

Not much work has been done to identify discrete distributions for which the inequality holds with the differential entropy replaced by the discrete entropy. Harremo "s and Vignat showed that it holds for the pair (B(m,p), B(n,p)), m,n in mathbb, (where B(n,p) is a Binomial distribution with n trials each with success probability p) for p = 0.5. In this paper, we considerably expand the set of Binomial distributions for which the inequality holds and, in particular, identify n_0(p) such that for all m,n geq n_0(p), the EPI holds for (B(m,p), B(n,p)). We further show that the EPI holds for the discrete random variables that can be expressed as the sum of n independent identical distributed (IID) discrete random variables for large n.',

	{'abstract': u'This paper investigates universal polar coding schemes. In particular, a notion of ordering (called convolutional path) is introduced between probability distributions to determine when a polar compression (or communication) scheme designed for one distribution can also succeed for another one. The original polar decoding algorithm is also generalized to an algorithm allowing to learn information about the source distribution using the idea of checkers. These tools are used to construct a universal compression algorithm for binary sources, operating at the lowest achievable rate (entropy), with low complexity and with guaranteed small error probability. In a second part of the paper, the problem of sketching high dimensional discrete signals which are sparse is approached via the polarization technique. It is shown that the number of measurements required for perfect recovery is competitive with the bound (with optimal constant for binary signals), meanwhile affording a deterministic low complexity measurement matrix.',

	{'abstract': u'Recent years have witnessed the popularity of using rank minimization as a regularizer for various signal processing and machine learning problems. As rank minimization problems are often converted to nuclear norm minimization (NNM) problems, they have to be solved iteratively and each iteration requires computing a singular value decomposition (SVD). Therefore, their solution suffers from the high computation cost of multiple SVDs. To relieve this issue, we propose using the block Lanczos method to compute the partial SVDs, where the principal singular subspaces obtained in the previous iteration are used to start the block Lanczos procedure. To avoid the expensive reorthogonalization in the Lanczos procedure, the block Lanczos procedure is performed for only a few steps. Our block Lanczos with warm start (BLWS) technique can be adopted by different algorithms that solve NNM problems. We present numerical results on applying BLWS to Robust PCA and Matrix Completion problems. Experimental results show that our BLWS technique usually accelerates its host algorithm by at least two to three times.',

	{'abstract': u'In the case of the scientometric evaluation of multi- or interdisciplinary units one risks to compare apples with oranges: each paper has to assessed in comparison to an appropriate reference set. We suggest that the set of citing papers first can be considered as the relevant representation of the field of impact. In order to normalize for differences in citation behavior among fields, citations can be fractionally counted proportionately to the length of the reference lists in the citing papers. This new method enables us to compare among units with different disciplinary affiliations at the paper level and also to assess the statistical significance of differences among sets. Twenty-seven departments of the Tsinghua University in Beijing are thus compared. Among them, the Department of Chinese Language and Linguistics is upgraded from the 19th to the second position in the ranking. The overall impact of 19 of the 27 departments is not significantly different at the 5% level when thus normalized for different citation potentials.',

	{'abstract': u'A boolean expression is in read-once form if each of its variables appears exactly once. When the variables denote independent events in a probability space, the probability of the event denoted by the whole expression in read-once form can be computed in polynomial time (whereas the general problem for arbitrary expressions is #P-complete). Known approaches to checking read-once property seem to require putting these expressions in disjunctive normal form. In this paper, we tell a better story for a large subclass of boolean event expressions: those that are generated by conjunctive queries without self-joins and on tuple-independent probabilistic databases. We first show that given a tuple-independent representation and the provenance graph of an SPJ query plan without self-joins, we can, without using the DNF of a result event expression, efficiently compute its co-occurrence graph. From this, the read-once form can already, if it exists, be computed efficiently using existing techniques. Our second and key contribution is a complete, efficient, and simple to implement algorithm for computing the read-once forms (whenever they exist) directly, using a new concept, that of co-table graph, which can be significantly smaller than the co-occurrence graph.',

	{'abstract': u'This paper is an attempt to incorporate the idea of spiking neural P systems as an early seed into the area of Operating System Design, regarding their capability to solve some classical computer science problems. It is reflecting the power of such systems to simulate well known parallel computational models, like logic gates, arithmetic operation, and sorting. In these devices, the time (when the neurons fire and/or spike) plays an essential role. For instance, the result of a computation is the time between the moments when a specified neuron spikes. Seen as number computing devices, SN P systems are shown to be computationally complete, and with such capabilities, arithmetic operations, logic, and timing, some first steps could be taken towards an OS design.',

	{'abstract': u'Uncertainty of decisions in safety-critical engineering applications can be estimated on the basis of the Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) technique of averaging over decision models. The use of decision tree (DT) models assists experts to interpret causal relations and find factors of the uncertainty. Bayesian averaging also allows experts to estimate the uncertainty accurately when a priori information on the favored structure of DTs is available. Then an expert can select a single DT model, typically the Maximum a Posteriori model, for interpretation purposes. Unfortunately, a priori information on favored structure of DTs is not always available. For this reason, we suggest a new prior on DTs for the Bayesian MCMC technique. We also suggest a new procedure of selecting a single DT and describe an application scenario. In our experiments on the Short-Term Conflict Alert data our technique outperforms the existing Bayesian techniques in predictive accuracy of the selected single DTs.',

	{'abstract': u"We live in a world increasingly dominated by networks -- communications, social, information, biological etc. A central attribute of many of these networks is that they are dynamic, that is, they exhibit structural changes over time. While the practice of dynamic networks has proliferated, we lag behind in the fundamental, mathematical understanding of network dynamism. Existing research on time-varying graphs ranges from preliminary algorithmic studies (e.g., Ferreira's work on evolving graphs) to analysis of specific properties such as flooding time in dynamic random graphs. A popular model for studying dynamic graphs is a sequence of graphs arranged by increasing snapshots of time. In this paper, we study the fundamental property of reachability in a time-varying graph over time and characterize the latency with respect to two metrics, namely store-or-advance latency and cut-through latency. Instead of expected value analysis, we concentrate on characterizing the exact probability distribution of routing latency along a randomly intermittent path in two popular dynamic random graph models. Using this analysis, we characterize the loss of accuracy (in a probabilistic setting) between multiple temporal graph models, ranging from one that preserves all the temporal ordering information for the purpose of computing temporal graph properties to one that collapses various snapshots into one graph (an operation called smashing), with multiple intermediate variants. We also show how some other traditional graph theoretic properties can be extended to the temporal domain. Finally, we propose algorithms for controlling the progress of a packet in single-copy adaptive routing schemes in various dynamic random graphs.",

This is one of the central problems in topological graph theory, that has been studied extensively over the past three decades. The first non-trivial efficient algorithm for the problem, due to Leighton and Rao, achieved an -approximation for bounded degree graphs. This algorithm has since been improved by poly-logarithmic factors, with the best current approximation ratio standing on for graphs with maximum degree . In contrast, only APX-hardness is known on the negative side. In this paper we present an efficient randomized algorithm to find a drawing of any -vertex graph in the plane with crossings, where is the number of crossings in the optimal solution, and is the maximum vertex degree in .

The other area in the Image mining system is the Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) which performs retrieval based on the similarity defined in terms of extracted features with more objectiveness. The drawback in CBIR is the features of the query image alone are considered. Hence, a new technique called Image retrieval based on optimum clusters is proposed for improving user interaction with image retrieval systems by fully exploiting the similarity information. The index is created by describing the images according to their color characteristics, with compact feature vectors, that represent typical color distributions [12].',

	{'abstract': u'Socio-economic data mining has a great potential in terms of gaining a better understanding of problems that our economy and society are facing, such as financial instability, shortages of resources, or conflicts. Without large-scale data mining, progress in these areas seems hard or impossible. Therefore, a suitable, distributed data mining infrastructure and research centers should be built in Europe. It also appears appropriate to build a network of Crisis Observatories. They can be imagined as laboratories devoted to the gathering and processing of enormous volumes of data on both natural systems such as the Earth and its ecosystem, as well as on human techno-socio-economic systems, so as to gain early warnings of impending events. Reality mining provides the chance to adapt more quickly and more accurately to changing situations. Further opportunities arise by individually customized services, which however should be provided in a privacy-respecting way. This requires the development of novel ICT (such as a self- organizing Web), but most likely new legal regulations and suitable institutions as well. As long as such regulations are lacking on a world-wide scale, it is in the public interest that scientists explore what can be done with the huge data available. Big data do have the potential to change or even threaten democratic societies. The same applies to sudden and large-scale failures of ICT systems. Therefore, dealing with data must be done with a large degree of responsibility and care. Self-interests of individuals, companies or institutions have limits, where the public interest is affected, and public interest is not a sufficient justification to violate human rights of individuals. Privacy is a high good, as confidentiality is, and damaging it would have serious side effects for society.',

	{'abstract': u'The GIIDA project aims to develop a digital infrastructure for the spatial information within CNR. It is foreseen to use semantic-oriented technologies to ease information modeling and connecting, according to international standards like the ISO/IEC 11179. Complex information management systems, like GIIDA, will take benefit from the use of terminological tools like thesauri that make available a reference lexicon for the indexing and retrieval of information. Within GIIDA the goal is to make available the EARTh thesaurus (Environmental Applications Reference Thesaurus), developed by the CNR-IIA-EKOLab. A web-based software, developed by the CNR-Water Research Institute (IRSA) was implemented to allow consultation and utilization of thesaurus through the web. This service is a useful tool to ensure interoperability between thesaurus and other systems of the indexing, with, the idea of cooperating to develop a comprehensive system of knowledge organization, that could be defined integrated, open, multi-functional and multilingual. Currently the system is available in multiple languages mode (Italian - English) and navigation can be done in the following ways: Alphabetical, Hierarchical and for Themes. A full search allows to find any term by searching for the whole term or a part of it and as well as allows to filter the results by themes. Within a collaborative initiative with the CNR-Institute of Applied Mathematics and Information Technology (IMATI) a SKOS (Simple Knowledge Organization System) version of EARTh was developed. This will ensure the possibility to support the use of the thesaurus within the framework of the Semantic Web in order to be used in decentralized metadata applications',

	{'abstract': u'In this paper, we propose a new method of channel estimation for asynchronous additive white Gaussian noise channels in satellite communications. This method is based on signals correlation and multiuser interference cancellation which adopts a successive structure. Propagation delays and signals amplitudes are jointly estimated in order to be used for data detection at the receiver. As, a multiuser detector, a single stage successive interference cancellation (SIC) architecture is analyzed and integrated to the channel estimation technique and the whole system is evaluated. The satellite access method adopted is the direct sequence code division multiple access (DS CDMA) one. To evaluate the channel estimation and the detection technique, we have simulated a satellite uplink with an asynchronous multiuser access.',

	{'abstract': u'This work considers the multiple-access multicast error-correction scenario over a packetized network with malicious edge adversaries. The network has min-cut and packets of length , and each sink demands all information from the set of sources . The capacity region is characterized for both a "side-channel" model (where sources and sinks share some random bits that are secret from the adversary) and an "omniscient" adversarial model (where no limitations on the adversary\'s knowledge are assumed). In the "side-channel" adversarial model, the use of a secret channel allows higher rates to be achieved compared to the "omniscient" adversarial model, and a polynomial-complexity capacity-achieving code is provided. For the "omniscient" adversarial model, two capacity-achieving constructions are given: the first is based on random subspace code design and has complexity exponential in , while the second uses a novel multiple-field-extension technique and has complexity, which is polynomial in the network size. Our code constructions are "end-to-end" in that all nodes except the sources and sinks are oblivious to the adversaries and may simply implement predesigned linear network codes (random or otherwise). Also, the sources act independently without knowledge of the data from other sources.',

	{'abstract': u'Gesture recognition is mainly apprehensive on analyzing the functionality of human wits. The main goal of gesture recognition is to create a system which can recognize specific human gestures and use them to convey information or for device control. Hand gestures provide a separate complementary modality to speech for expressing ones ideas. Information associated with hand gestures in a conversation is degree,discourse structure, spatial and temporal structure. The approaches present can be mainly divided into Data-Glove Based and Vision Based approaches. An important face feature point is the nose tip. Since nose is the highest protruding point from the face. Besides that, it is not affected by facial expressions.Another important function of the nose is that it is able to indicate the head pose. Knowledge of the nose location will enable us to align an unknown 3D face with those in a face database. Eye detection is divided into eye position detection and eye contour detection. Existing works in eye detection can be classified into two major categories: traditional image-based passive approaches and the active IR based approaches. The former uses intensity and shape of eyes for detection and the latter works on the assumption that eyes have a reflection under near IR illumination and produce bright/dark pupil effect. The traditional methods can be broadly classified into three categories: template based methods,appearance based methods and feature based methods. The purpose of this paper is to compare various human Gesture recognition systems for interfacing machines directly to human wits without any corporeal media in an ambient environment.',

	{'abstract': u'We consider molecular communication, with information conveyed in the time of release of molecules. The main contribution of this paper is the development of a theoretical foundation for such a communication system. Specifically, we develop the additive inverse Gaussian (IG) noise channel model: a channel in which the information is corrupted by noise with an inverse Gaussian distribution. We show that such a channel model is appropriate for molecular communication in fluid media - when propagation between transmitter and receiver is governed by Brownian motion and when there is positive drift from transmitter to receiver. Taking advantage of the available literature on the IG distribution, upper and lower bounds on channel capacity are developed, and a maximum likelihood receiver is derived. Theory and simulation results are presented which show that such a channel does not have a single quality measure analogous to signal-to-noise ratio in the AWGN channel. It is also shown that the use of multiple molecules leads to reduced error rate in a manner akin to diversity order in wireless communications. Finally, we discuss some open problems in molecular communications that arise from the IG system model.',

	{'abstract': u'We present a combinatorial characterization of the Bethe entropy function of a factor graph, such a characterization being in contrast to the original, analytical, definition of this function. We achieve this combinatorial characterization by counting valid configurations in finite graph covers of the factor graph. Analogously, we give a combinatorial characterization of the Bethe partition function, whose original definition was also of an analytical nature. As we point out, our approach has similarities to the replica method, but also stark differences. The above findings are a natural backdrop for introducing a decoder for graph-based codes that we will call symbolwise graph-cover decoding, a decoder that extends our earlier work on blockwise graph-cover decoding. Both graph-cover decoders are theoretical tools that help towards a better understanding of message-passing iterative decoding, namely blockwise graph-cover decoding links max-product (min-sum) algorithm decoding with linear programming decoding, and symbolwise graph-cover decoding links sum-product algorithm decoding with Bethe free energy function minimization at temperature one. In contrast to the Gibbs entropy function, which is a concave function, the Bethe entropy function is in general not concave everywhere. In particular, we show that every code picked from an ensemble of regular low-density parity-check codes with minimum Hamming distance growing (with high probability) linearly with the block length has a Bethe entropy function that is convex in certain regions of its domain.',

	{'abstract': u'Testing is one of the most indispensable tasks in software engineering. The role of testing in software development has grown significantly because testing is able to reveal defects in the code in an early stage of development. Many unit test frameworks compatible with C/C++ code exist, but a standard one is missing. Unfortunately, many unsolved problems can be mentioned with the existing methods, for example usually external tools are necessary for testing C++ programs. In this paper we present a new approach for testing C++ programs. Our solution is based on C++ template metaprogramming facilities, so it can work with the standard-compliant compilers. The metaprogramming approach ensures that the overhead of testing is minimal at runtime. This approach also supports that the specification language can be customized among other advantages. Nevertheless, the only necessary tool is the compiler itself.',

	{'abstract': u'In sparse light splitting all-optical WDM networks, the more destinations a light-tree can accommodate, the fewer light-trees andwavelengths amulticast session will require. In this article, a Hypo-Steiner light-tree algorithm (HSLT) is proposed to construct a HSLT light-tree to include as many destinations as possible. The upper bound cost of the light-trees built by HSLT is given as N(N -1)/2, where N is the number of nodes in the network. The analytical model proves that, under the same condition, more destinations could be held in a HSLT than a Member-Only (Zhang et al., J. Lightware Technol, 18(12), 1917-1927 2000.) light-tree. Extensive simulations not only validate the proof but also show that the proposed heuristic outperforms the existing multicast routing algorithms by a large margin in terms of link stress, throughput, and efficiency ofwavelength usage.',

	{'abstract': u"In this articlewestudy themulticast routing problem in all-opticalWDMnetworks under the spare light splitting constraint. To implement a multicast session, several light-trees may have to be used due to the limited fanouts of network nodes. Although many multicast routing algorithms have been proposed in order to reduce the total number of wavelength channels used (total cost) for a multicast session, the maximum number of wavelengths required in one fiber link (link stress) and the end-to-end delay are two parameters which are not always taken into consideration. It is known that the shortest path tree (SPT) results in the optimal end-to-end delay, but it can not be employed directly for multicast routing in sparse light splitting WDM networks. Hence, we propose a novel wavelength routing algorithm which tries to avoid the multicast incapable branching nodes (MIBs, branching nodes without splitting capability) in the shortest-path-based multicast tree to diminish the link stress. Good parts of the shortest-path-tree are retained by the algorithm to reduce the end-to-end delay. The algorithm consists of tree steps: (1) aDijkstraPro algorithmwith priority assignment and node adoption is introduced to produce a SPT with up to 38% fewer MIB nodes in the NSF topology and 46% fewerMIB nodes in the USA Longhaul topology, (2) critical articulation and deepest branch heuristics are used to process the MIB nodes, (3) a distance-based light-tree reconnection algorithm is proposed to create the multicast light-trees. Extensive simulations demonstrate the algorithm's efficiency in terms of link stress and end-to-end delay.",

	{'abstract': u'This paper is about the design and analysis of an index-assignment (IA) based multiple-description coding scheme for the n-channel asymmetric case. We use entropy constrained lattice vector quantization and restrict attention to simple reconstruction functions, which are given by the inverse IA function when all descriptions are received or otherwise by a weighted average of the received descriptions. We consider smooth sources with finite differential entropy rate and MSE fidelity criterion. As in previous designs, our construction is based on nested lattices which are combined through a single IA function. The results are exact under high-resolution conditions and asymptotically as the nesting ratios of the lattices approach infinity. For any n, the design is asymptotically optimal within the class of IA-based schemes. Moreover, in the case of two descriptions and finite lattice vector dimensions greater than one, the performance is strictly better than that of existing designs. In the case of three descriptions, we show that in the limit of large lattice vector dimensions, points on the inner bound of Pradhan et al. can be achieved. Furthermore, for three descriptions and finite lattice vector dimensions, we show that the IA-based approach yields, in the symmetric case, a smaller rate loss than the recently proposed source-splitting approach.',

	{'abstract': u'Based on the false assumption that multicast incapable (MI) nodes could not be traversed twice on the same wavelength, the light-tree structure was always thought to be optimal for multicast routing in sparse splitting Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) networks. In fact, for establishing a multicast session, an MI node could be crosswise visited more than once to switch a light signal towards several destinations with only one wavelength through different input and output pairs. This is called Cross Pair Switching (CPS). Thus, a new multicast routing structure light-hierarchy is proposed for all-optical multicast routing, which permits the cycles introduced by the CPS capability of MI nodes. We proved that the optimal structure for minimizing the cost of multicast routing is a set of light-hierarchies rather than the light-trees in sparse splitting WDM networks. Integer linear programming (ILP) formulations are developed to search the optimal light-hierarchies. Numerical results verified that the light-hierarchy structure could save more cost than the light-tree structure.',

	{'abstract': u'To minimize the number of wavelengths required by a multicast session in sparse light splitting wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) networks, a light-hierarchy structure, which occupies the same wavelength on all links, is proposed to span as many destinations as possible. Different from a light-tree, a light-hierarchy accepts cycles, which are used to traverse crosswise a 4-degree (or above) multicast incapable (MI) node twice (or above) and switch two light signals on the same wavelengths to two destinations in the same multicast session. In this paper, firstly, a graph renewal and distance priority light-tree algorithm (GRDP-LT) is introduced to improve the quality of light-trees built for a multicast request. Then, it is extended to compute light-hierarchies. Obtained numerical results demonstrate the GRDP-LT light-trees can achieve a much lower links stress, better wavelength channel cost, and smaller average end-to-end delay as well as diameter than the currently most efficient algorithm. Furthermore, compared to light-trees, the performance in terms of link stress and network throughput is greatly improved again by employing the light-hierarchy, while consuming the same amount of wavelength channel cost.',

	{'abstract': u'In this paper, secure transmission of information over fading broadcast channels is studied in the presence of statistical queueing constraints. Effective capacity is employed as a performance metric to identify the secure throughput of the system, i.e., effective secure throughput. It is assumed that perfect channel side information (CSI) is available at both the transmitter and the receivers. Initially, the scenario in which the transmitter sends common messages to two receivers and confidential messages to one receiver is considered. For this case, effective secure throughput region, which is the region of constant arrival rates of common and confidential messages that can be supported by the buffer-constrained transmitter and fading broadcast channel, is defined. It is proven that this effective throughput region is convex. Then, the optimal power control policies that achieve the boundary points of the effective secure throughput region are investigated and an algorithm for the numerical computation of the optimal power adaptation schemes is provided. Subsequently, the special case in which the transmitter sends only confidential messages to one receiver, is addressed in more detail. For this case, effective secure throughput is formulated and two different power adaptation policies are studied. In particular, it is noted that opportunistic transmission is no longer optimal under buffer constraints and the transmitter should not wait to send the data at a high rate until the main channel is much better than the eavesdropper channel.',

	{'abstract': u'The past few years have seen intensive research efforts carried out in some apparently unrelated areas of dynamic systems -- delay-tolerant networks, opportunistic-mobility networks, social networks -- obtaining closely related insights. Indeed, the concepts discovered in these investigations can be viewed as parts of the same conceptual universe; and the formal models proposed so far to express some specific concepts are components of a larger formal description of this universe. The main contribution of this paper is to integrate the vast collection of concepts, formalisms, and results found in the literature into a unified framework, which we call TVG (for time-varying graphs). Using this framework, it is possible to express directly in the same formalism not only the concepts common to all those different areas, but also those specific to each. Based on this definitional work, employing both existing results and original observations, we present a hierarchical classification of TVGs; each class corresponds to a significant property examined in the distributed computing literature. We then examine how TVGs can be used to study the evolution of network properties, and propose different techniques, depending on whether the indicators for these properties are a-temporal (as in the majority of existing studies) or temporal. Finally, we briefly discuss the introduction of randomness in TVGs.',

	{'abstract': u"We present a multi-level graph partitioning algorithm using novel local improvement algorithms and global search strategies transferred from the multi-grid community. Local improvement algorithms are based max-flow min-cut computations and more localized FM searches. By combining these techniques, we obtain an algorithm that is fast on the one hand and on the other hand is able to improve the best known partitioning results for many inputs. For example, in Walshaw's well known benchmark tables we achieve 317 improvements for the tables 1%, 3% and 5% imbalance. Moreover, in 118 additional cases we have been able to reproduce the best cut in this benchmark.",

We discuss conjecturally tight bounds on the maximal number of non-degenerate roots F can have over L, with all coordinates having fixed phase, as a function of n, k, and L only. In particular, we give new explicit systems with number of roots approaching the best known upper bounds. We also briefly review the background behind such bounds, and their application, including connections to computational number theory and variants of the Shub-Smale tau-Conjecture and the P vs. NP Problem. One of our key tools is the construction of combinatorially constrained tropical varieties with maximally many intersections.',

	{'abstract': u'In this paper, the problem of constructing an efficient quantum circuit for the implementation of an arbitrary quantum computation is addressed. To this end, a basic block based on the cosine-sine decomposition method is suggested which contains qubits. In addition, a previously proposed quantum-logic synthesis method based on quantum Shannon decomposition is recursively applied to reach unitary gates over qubits. Then, the basic block is used and some optimizations are applied to remove redundant gates. It is shown that the exact value of affects the number of one-qubit and CNOT gates in the proposed method. In comparison to the previous synthesis methods, the value of is examined consequently to improve either the number of CNOT gates or the total number of gates. The proposed approach is further analyzed by considering the nearest neighbor limitation. According to our evaluation, the number of CNOT gates is increased by at most a factor of if the nearest neighbor interaction is applied.',

	{'abstract': u'We present a protocol for performing state merging when multiple parties share a single copy of a mixed state, and analyze the entanglement cost in terms of min- and max-entropies. Our protocol allows for interpolation between corner points of the rate region without the need for time-sharing, a primitive which is not available in the one-shot setting. We also compare our protocol to the more naive strategy of repeatedly applying a single-party merging protocol one party at a time, by performing a detailed analysis of the rates required to merge variants of the embezzling states. Finally, we analyze a variation of multiparty merging, which we call split-transfer, by considering two receivers and many additional helpers sharing a mixed state. We give a protocol for performing a split-transfer and apply it to the problem of assisted entanglement distillation.',

	{'abstract': u'Motivated by the problem of designing quantum repeaters, we study entanglement distillation between two parties, Alice and Bob, starting from a mixed state and with the help of "repeater" stations. To treat the case of a single repeater, we extend the notion of entanglement of assistance to arbitrary mixed tripartite states and exhibit a protocol, based on a random coding strategy, for extracting pure entanglement. The rates achievable by this protocol formally resemble those achievable if the repeater station could merge its state to one of Alice and Bob even when such merging is impossible. This rate is provably better than the hashing bound for sufficiently pure tripartite states. We also compare our assisted distillation protocol to a hierarchical strategy consisting of entanglement distillation followed by entanglement swapping. We demonstrate by the use of a simple example that our random measurement strategy outperforms hierarchical distillation strategies when the individual helper stations\' states fail to individually factorize into portions associated specifically with Alice and Bob. Finally, we use these results to find achievable rates for the more general scenario, where many spatially separated repeaters help two recipients distill entanglement.',

Based on this principle a Lyapunov-based nonlinear adaptive controller is developed that only needs control derivatives of the kite aerodynamic model. The resulting controller is validated using simulations with a point-mass kite model.',

	{'abstract': u'The Kuramoto model captures various synchronization phenomena in biological and man-made systems of coupled oscillators. It is well-known that there exists a critical coupling strength among the oscillators at which a phase transition from incoherency to synchronization occurs. This paper features four contributions. First, we characterize and distinguish the different notions of synchronization used throughout the literature and formally introduce the concept of phase cohesiveness as an analysis tool and performance index for synchronization. Second, we review the vast literature providing necessary, sufficient, implicit, and explicit estimates of the critical coupling strength for finite and infinite-dimensional, and for first and second-order Kuramoto models. Third, we present the first explicit necessary and sufficient condition on the critical coupling to achieve synchronization in the finite-dimensional Kuramoto model for an arbitrary distribution of the natural frequencies. The multiplicative gap in the synchronization condition yields a practical stability result determining the admissible initial and the guaranteed ultimate phase cohesiveness as well as the guaranteed asymptotic magnitude of the order parameter. Fourth and finally, we extend our analysis to multi-rate Kuramoto models consisting of second-order Kuramoto oscillators with inertia and viscous damping together with first-order Kuramoto oscillators with multiple time constants. We prove that the multi-rate Kuramoto model is locally topologically conjugate to a first-order Kuramoto model with scaled natural frequencies, and we present necessary and sufficient conditions for almost global phase synchronization and local frequency synchronization. Interestingly, these conditions do not depend on the inertiae which contradicts prior observations on the role of inertiae in synchronization of second-order Kuramoto models.',

	{'abstract': u'We present a quasipolynomial-time algorithm for solving the weak membership problem for the convex set of separable, i.e. non-entangled, bipartite density matrices. The algorithm decides whether a density matrix is separable or whether it is eps-away from the set of the separable states in time exp(O(eps^-2 log |A| log |B|)), where |A| and |B| are the local dimensions, and the distance is measured with either the Euclidean norm, or with the so-called LOCC norm. The latter is an operationally motivated norm giving the optimal probability of distinguishing two bipartite quantum states, each shared by two parties, using any protocol formed by quantum local operations and classical communication (LOCC) between the parties. We also obtain improved algorithms for optimizing over the set of separable states and for computing the ground-state energy of mean-field Hamiltonians. The techniques we develop are also applied to quantum Merlin-Arthur games, where we show that multiple provers are not more powerful than a single prover when the verifier is restricted to LOCC protocols, or when the verification procedure is formed by a measurement of small Euclidean norm. This answers a question posed by Aaronson et al (Theory of Computing 5, 1, 2009) and provides two new characterizations of the complexity class QMA, a quantum analog of NP. Our algorithm uses semidefinite programming to search for a symmetric extension, as first proposed by Doherty, Parrilo and Spedialieri (Phys. Rev. A, 69, 022308, 2004). The bound on the runtime follows from an improved de Finetti-type bound quantifying the monogamy of quantum entanglement, proved in (arXiv:1010.1750). This result, in turn, follows from a new lower bound on the quantum conditional mutual information and the entanglement measure squashed entanglement.',

	{'abstract': u'Mean field games is a recent area of study introduced by Lions and Lasry in a series of seminal papers in 2006. Mean field games model situations of competition between large number of rational agents that play non-cooperative dynamic games under certain symmetry assumptions. They key step is to develop a mean field model, in a similar way that what is done in statistical physics in order to construct a mathematically tractable model. A main question that arises in the study of such mean field problems is the rigorous justification of the mean field models by a limiting procedure. In this paper we consider the mean field limit of two-state Markov decision problem as the number of players . First we establish the existence and uniqueness of a symmetric partial information Markov perfect equilibrium. Then we derive a mean field model and characterize its main properties. This mean field limit is a system of coupled ordinary differential equations with initial-terminal data. Our main result is the convergence as of the player game to the mean field model and an estimate of the rate of convergence.',

	{'abstract': u'Multiple kernel learning (MKL), structured sparsity, and multi-task learning have recently received considerable attention. In this paper, we show how different MKL algorithms can be understood as applications of either regularization on the kernel weights or block-norm-based regularization, which is more common in structured sparsity and multi-task learning. We show that these two regularization strategies can be systematically mapped to each other through a concave conjugate operation. When the kernel-weight-based regularizer is separable into components, we can naturally consider a generative probabilistic model behind MKL. Based on this model, we propose learning algorithms for the kernel weights through the maximization of marginal likelihood. We show through numerical experiments that -norm MKL and Elastic-net MKL achieve comparable accuracy to uniform kernel combination. Although uniform kernel combination might be preferable from its simplicity, -norm MKL and Elastic-net MKL can learn the usefulness of the information sources represented as kernels. In particular, Elastic-net MKL achieves sparsity in the kernel weights.',

	{'abstract': u'We realize a biochemical filtering process by introducing a buffer in a biocatalytic signal-transduction logic system based on the function of an enzyme, esterase. The input, ethyl butyrate, is converted into butyric acid-the output signal, which in turn is measured by the drop in the pH value. The developed approach offers a versatile "network element" for increasing the complexity of biochemical information processing systems. Evaluation of an optimal regime for quality filtering is accomplished in the framework of a kinetic rate-equation model.',

	{'abstract': u'We extend the Hopf algebra description of a simple quantum system given previously, to a more elaborate Hopf algebra, which is rich enough to encompass that related to a description of perturbative quantum field theory (pQFT). This provides a route from an algebraic description of non-relativistic, non-field theoretic quantum statistical mechanics to one of relativistic quantum field theory. Such a description necessarily involves treating the algebra of polyzeta functions, extensions of the Riemann Zeta function, since these occur naturally in pQFT. This provides a link between physics, algebra and number theory. As a by-product of this approach, we are led to indicate a basis for concluding that the Euler gamma constant may be rational.',

	{'abstract': u'Bayesian networks are basic graphical models, used widely both in statistics and artificial intelligence. These statistical models of conditional independence structure are described by acyclic directed graphs whose nodes correspond to (random) variables in consideration. A quite important topic is the learning of Bayesian network structures, which is determining the best fitting statistical model on the basis of given data. Although there are learning methods based on statistical conditional independence tests, contemporary methods are mainly based on maximization of a suitable quality criterion that evaluates how good the graph explains the occurrence of the observed data. This leads to a nonlinear combinatorial optimization problem that is in general NP-hard to solve. In this paper we deal with the complexity of learning restricted Bayesian network structures, that is, we wish to find network structures of highest score within a given subset of all possible network structures. For this, we introduce a new unique algebraic representative for these structures, called the characteristic imset. We show that these imsets are always 0-1-vectors and that they have many nice properties that allow us to simplify long proofs for some known results and to easily establish new complexity results for learning restricted Bayes network structures.',

	{'abstract': u'The problem of computing a representation for a real polynomial as a sum of minimum number of squares of polynomials can be casted as finding a symmetric positive semidefinite real matrix (Gram matrix) of minimum rank subject to linear equality constraints. In this paper, we propose algorithms for solving the minimum-rank Gram matrix completion problem, and show the convergence of these algorithms. Our methods are based on the modified fixed point continuation (FPC) method. We also use the Barzilai-Borwein (BB) technique and a specific linear combination of two previous iterates to accelerate the convergence of modified FPC algorithms. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithms for computing approximate and exact rational sum of squares (SOS) decompositions of polynomials with rational coefficients.',

AMP's web-based interface was developed as a traditional standalone database-backed web application using the Python-based Django web development framework, allowing us to leverage the Django framework's capabilities while cleanly separating the user interface development from the grid interface development.

	{'abstract': u'Nuclear norm minimization (NNM) has recently gained significant attention for its use in rank minimization problems. Similar to compressed sensing, using null space characterizations, recovery thresholds for NNM have been studied in cite. However simulations show that the thresholds are far from optimal, especially in the low rank region. In this paper we apply the recent analysis of Stojnic for compressed sensing cite to the null space conditions of NNM. The resulting thresholds are significantly better and in particular our weak threshold appears to match with simulation results. Further our curves suggest for any rank growing linearly with matrix size we need only three times of oversampling (the model complexity) for weak recovery. Similar to cite we analyze the conditions for weak, sectional and strong thresholds. Additionally a separate analysis is given for special case of positive semidefinite matrices. We conclude by discussing simulation results and future research directions.',

	{'abstract': u'Large-scale data resulting from users online interactions provide the ultimate source of information to study emergent social phenomena on the Web. From individual actions of users to observable collective behaviors, different mechanisms involving emotions expressed in the posted text play a role. Here we combine approaches of statistical physics with machine-learning methods of text analysis to study emergence of the emotional behavior among Web users. Mapping the high-resolution data from digg.com onto bipartite network of users and their comments onto posted stories, we identify user communities centered around certain popular posts and determine emotional contents of the related comments by the emotion-classifier developed for this type of texts. Applied over different time periods, this framework reveals strong correlations between the excess of negative emotions and the evolution of communities. We observe avalanches of emotional comments exhibiting significant self-organized critical behavior and temporal correlations. To explore robustness of these critical states, we design a network automaton model on realistic network connections and several control parameters, which can be inferred from the dataset. Dissemination of emotions by a small fraction of very active users appears to critically tune the collective states.',

Following up the work presented at ACAT 2008, we use the multivariate technique presented there (a rule growing algorithm with the meta-methods bagging and instance weighting) on much more imbalanced data sets, especially a selection of D0 decays without the use of particle identification. It turns out that the quality of the result strongly depends on the number of background instances used for training. We discuss methods to exploit this in order to improve the results significantly, and how to handle and reduce the size of large training sets without loss of result quality in general. We will also comment on how to take into account statistical fluctuation in receiver operation characteristic curves (ROC) for comparing classifier methods.',

	{'abstract': u'Statistical models of natural stimuli provide an important tool for researchers in the fields of machine learning and computational neuroscience. A canonical way to quantitatively assess and compare the performance of statistical models is given by the likelihood. One class of statistical models which has recently gained increasing popularity and has been applied to a variety of complex data are deep belief networks. Analyses of these models, however, have been typically limited to qualitative analyses based on samples due to the computationally intractable nature of the model likelihood. Motivated by these circumstances, the present article provides a consistent estimator for the likelihood that is both computationally tractable and simple to apply in practice. Using this estimator, a deep belief network which has been suggested for the modeling of natural image patches is quantitatively investigated and compared to other models of natural image patches. Contrary to earlier claims based on qualitative results, the results presented in this article provide evidence that the model under investigation is not a particularly good model for natural images',

Barvinok [Computing the Ehrhart quasi-polynomial of a rational simplex, Math. Comp. 75 (2006), 1449--1466]. For a given semi-rational polytope P and a rational subspace L, we integrate a given polynomial function h over all lattice slices of the polytope P parallel to the subspace L and sum up the integrals. We first develop an algorithmic theory of parametric intermediate generating functions. Then we study the Ehrhart theory of these intermediate sums, that is, the dependence of the result as a function of a dilation of the polytope. We provide an algorithm to compute the resulting Ehrhart quasi-polynomials in the form of explicit step polynomials. These formulas are naturally valid for real (not just integer) dilations and thus provide a direct approach to real Ehrhart theory.',

	{'abstract': u'The science of networks has revolutionised research into the dynamics of interacting elements. It could be argued that epidemiology in particular has embraced the potential of network theory more than any other discipline. Here we review the growing body of research concerning the spread of infectious diseases on networks, focusing on the interplay between network theory and epidemiology. The review is split into four main sections, which examine: the types of network relevant to epidemiology; the multitude of ways these networks can be characterised; the statistical methods that can be applied to infer the epidemiological parameters on a realised network; and finally simulation and analytical methods to determine epidemic dynamics on a given network. Given the breadth of areas covered and the ever-expanding number of publications, a comprehensive review of all work is impossible. Instead, we provide a personalised overview into the areas of network epidemiology that have seen the greatest progress in recent years or have the greatest potential to provide novel insights. As such, considerable importance is placed on analytical approaches and statistical methods which are both rapidly expanding fields. Throughout this review we restrict our attention to epidemiological issues.',

	{'abstract': u'This article concerns the resolution of impartial combinatorial games, and in particular games that can be split in sums of independent positions. We prove that in order to compute the outcome of a sum of independent positions, it is always more efficient to compute separately the nimbers of each independent position than to develop directly the game tree of the sum. The concept of nimber is therefore inevitable to solve impartial games, even when we only try to determinate the winning or losing outcome of a starting position. We also describe algorithms to use nimbers efficiently and finally, we give a review of the results obtained on two impartial games: Sprouts and Cram.',

	{'abstract': u'The aim of this chapter is to show how option prices in jump-diffusion models can be computed using meshless methods based on Radial Basis Function (RBF) interpolation. The RBF technique is demonstrated by solving the partial integro-differential equation (PIDE) in one-dimension for the American put and the European vanilla call/put options on dividend-paying stocks in the Merton and Kou jump-diffusion models. The radial basis function we select is the Cubic Spline. We also propose a simple numerical algorithm for finding a finite computational range of an improper integral term in the PIDE so that the accuracy of approximation of the integral can be improved. Moreover, the solution functions of the PIDE are approximated explicitly by RBFs which have exact forms so we can easily compute the global integral by any kind of numerical quadrature. Finally, we will not only show numerically that our scheme is second order accurate in both spatial and time variables in a European case but also second order accurate in spatial variables and first order accurate in time variables in an American case.',

	{'abstract': u'One of the most important open questions in the theory of quantum convolutional coding is to determine a minimal-memory, non-catastrophic, polynomial-depth convolutional encoder for an arbitrary quantum convolutional code. Here, we present a technique that finds quantum convolutional encoders with such desirable properties for several example quantum convolutional codes (an exposition of our technique in full generality will appear elsewhere). We first show how to encode the well-studied Forney-Grassl-Guha (FGG) code with an encoder that exploits just one memory qubit (the former Grassl-Roetteler encoder requires 15 memory qubits). We then show how our technique can find an online decoder corresponding to this encoder, and we also detail the operation of our technique on a different example of a quantum convolutional code. Finally, the reduction in memory for the FGG encoder makes it feasible to simulate the performance of a quantum turbo code employing it, and we present the results of such simulations.',

	{'abstract': u'A large set of signals can sometimes be described sparsely using a dictionary, that is, every element can be represented as a linear combination of few elements from the dictionary. Algorithms for various signal processing applications, including classification, denoising and signal separation, learn a dictionary from a set of signals to be represented. Can we expect that the representation found by such a dictionary for a previously unseen example from the same source will have L_2 error of the same magnitude as those for the given examples? We assume signals are generated from a fixed distribution, and study this questions from a statistical learning theory perspective. We develop generalization bounds on the quality of the learned dictionary for two types of constraints on the coefficient selection, as measured by the expected L_2 error in representation when the dictionary is used. For the case of l_1 regularized coefficient selection we provide a generalization bound of the order of O(sqrt(np log(m lambda)/m)), where n is the dimension, p is the number of elements in the dictionary, lambda is a bound on the l_1 norm of the coefficient vector and m is the number of samples, which complements existing results. For the case of representing a new signal as a combination of at most k dictionary elements, we provide a bound of the order O(sqrt(np log(m k)/m)) under an assumption on the level of orthogonality of the dictionary (low Babel function). We further show that this assumption holds for most dictionaries in high dimensions in a strong probabilistic sense. Our results further yield fast rates of order 1/m as opposed to 1/sqrt(m) using localized Rademacher complexity. We provide similar results in a general setting using kernels with weak smoothness requirements.',

	{'abstract': u"The aim of this study is to make a bibliometric comparison of the performance of research astronomers in the Netherlands Research School for Astronomy (NOVA) with astronomers elsewhere by using the NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS). We use various indices for bibliometric performance for a sample of NOVA astronomers to compare to samples of astronomers worldwide, and from the United States. We give much weight to normalising bibliometric measures by number of authors, and number of years since first publication. In particular we calculate the `Hirsh-index' normalized to number of authors and for first-author papers. Secondly, we consider the results of the 'Nederlands Observatorium van Wetenschap en Technologie' (NOWT; Netherlands Observatory of Science and Technology), which regularly publishes a report 'Science and Technology Indicators'. We reproduce those results using publication lists from institutions in the Netherlands, again using ADS, and examine and discuss the conclusions and indications in these reports. We find that the NOVA researchers perform much better in bibliometric measures than samples drawn from IAU or AAS membership lists. A more suitable comparison is one with the (tenured) staff of the top-15 US institutions and there the NOVA staff performs in these respects as good or almost as good as that of American top institutes. From a citation analysis through the use of ADS we conclude that the impact ratio of Dutch astronomical publications is rising which is opposite to what is reported by NOWT. This difference is most likely caused by a better separation of astronomy and physics in ADS than in World of Knowledge. ADS probably finds more citations in conference proceedings, while the inclusion of citations to articles with their pre-print identifier could also help explain the difference (especially since the citation windows in the reports are short).",

	{'abstract': u'This chapter describes how astronomical imaging survey data have become a vital part of modern astronomy, how these data are archived and then served to the astronomical community through on-line data access portals. The Virtual Observatory, now under development, aims to make all these data accessible through a uniform set of interfaces. This chapter also describes the scientific need for one common image processing task, that of composing individual images into large scale mosaics and introduces Montage as a tool for this task. Montage, as distributed, can be used in four ways: as a single thread/process on a single CPU, in parallel using MPI to distribute similar tasks across a parallel computer, in parallel using grid tools (Pegasus/DAGMan) to distributed tasks across a grid, or in parallel using a script-driven approach (Swift). An on-request web based Montage service is available for users who do not need to build a local version. We also introduce some work on a new scripted version of Montage, which offers ease of customization for users. Then, we discuss various ideas where Web 2.0 technologies can help the Montage community.',

	{'abstract': u'Many clustering schemes are defined by optimizing an objective function defined on the partitions of the underlying set of a finite metric space. In this paper, we construct a framework for studying what happens when we instead impose various structural conditions on the clustering schemes, under the general heading of functoriality. Functoriality refers to the idea that one should be able to compare the results of clustering algorithms as one varies the data set, for example by adding points or by applying functions to it. We show that within this framework, one can prove a theorems analogous to one of J. Kleinberg, in which for example one obtains an existence and uniqueness theorem instead of a non-existence result. We obtain a full classification of all clustering schemes satisfying a condition we refer to as excisiveness. The classification can be changed by varying the notion of maps of finite metric spaces. The conditions occur naturally when one considers clustering as the statistical version of the geometric notion of connected components. By varying the degree of functoriality that one requires from the schemes it is possible to construct richer families of clustering schemes that exhibit sensitivity to density.',

	{'abstract': u'We obtain the degree distribution for a class of growing network models on flat and curved spaces. These models evolve by preferential attachment weighted by a function of the distance between nodes. The degree distribution of these models is similar to the one of the fitness model of Bianconi and Barabasi, with a fitness distribution dependent on the metric and the density of nodes. We show that curvature singularities in these spaces can give rise to asymptotic Bose-Einstein condensation, but transient condensation can be observed also in smooth hyperbolic spaces with strong curvature. We provide numerical results for spaces of constant curvature (sphere, flat and hyperbolic space) and we discuss the conditions for the breakdown of this approach and the critical points of the transition to distance-dominated attachment. Finally we discuss the distribution of link lengths.',

	{'abstract': u'Cellular automata have been mainly studied on very regular graphs carrying the vertices (like lines or grids) and under synchronous dynamics (all vertices update simultaneously). In this paper, we study how the asynchronism and the graph act upon the dynamics of the classical Minority rule. Minority has been well-studied for synchronous updates and is thus a reasonable choice to begin with. Yet, beyond its apparent simplicity, this rule yields complex behaviors when asynchronism is introduced. We investigate the transitory part as well as the asymptotic behavior of the dynamics under full asynchronism (also called sequential: only one random vertex updates at each time step) for several types of graphs. Such a comparative study is a first step in understanding how the asynchronous dynamics is linked to the topology (the graph). Previous analyses on the grid [1,2] have observed that Minority seems to induce fast stabilization. We investigate here this property on arbitrary graphs using tools such as energy, particles and random walks. We show that the worst case convergence time is, in fact, strongly dependent on the topology. In particular, we observe that the case of trees is non trivial.',

	{'abstract': u'We consider the restless multi-armed bandit (RMAB) problem with unknown dynamics in which a player chooses M out of N arms to play at each time. The reward state of each arm transits according to an unknown Markovian rule when it is played and evolves according to an arbitrary unknown random process when it is passive. The performance of an arm selection policy is measured by regret, defined as the reward loss with respect to the case where the player knows which M arms are the most rewarding and always plays the M best arms. We construct a policy with an interleaving exploration and exploitation epoch structure that achieves a regret with logarithmic order when arbitrary (but nontrivial) bounds on certain system parameters are known. When no knowledge about the system is available, we show that the proposed policy achieves a regret arbitrarily close to the logarithmic order. We further extend the problem to a decentralized setting where multiple distributed players share the arms without information exchange. Under both an exogenous restless model and an endogenous restless model, we show that a decentralized extension of the proposed policy preserves the logarithmic regret order as in the centralized setting. The results apply to adaptive learning in various dynamic systems and communication networks, as well as financial investment.',

	{'abstract': u'Social groups are fundamental building blocks of human societies. While our social interactions have always been constrained by geography, it has been impossible, due to practical difficulties, to evaluate the nature of this restriction on social group structure. We construct a social network of individuals whose most frequent geographical locations are also known. We also classify the individuals into groups according to a community detection algorithm. We study the variation of geographical span for social groups of varying sizes, and explore the relationship between topological positions and geographic positions of their members. We find that small social groups are geographically very tight, but become much more clumped when the group size exceeds about 30 members. Also, we find no correlation between the topological positions and geographic positions of individuals within network communities. These results suggest that spreading processes face distinct structural and spatial constraints.',

	{'abstract': u'In the classic Bayesian restless multi-armed bandit (RMAB) problem, there are arms, with rewards on all arms evolving at each time as Markov chains with known parameters. A player seeks to activate arms at each time in order to maximize the expected total reward obtained over multiple plays. RMAB is a challenging problem that is known to be PSPACE-hard in general. We consider in this work the even harder non-Bayesian RMAB, in which the parameters of the Markov chain are assumed to be unknown emph. We develop an original approach to this problem that is applicable when the corresponding Bayesian problem has the structure that, depending on the known parameter values, the optimal solution is one of a prescribed finite set of policies. In such settings, we propose to learn the optimal policy for the non-Bayesian RMAB by employing a suitable meta-policy which treats each policy from this finite set as an arm in a different non-Bayesian multi-armed bandit problem for which a single-arm selection policy is optimal. We demonstrate this approach by developing a novel sensing policy for opportunistic spectrum access over unknown dynamic channels. We prove that our policy achieves near-logarithmic regret (the difference in expected reward compared to a model-aware genie), which leads to the same average reward that can be achieved by the optimal policy under a known model. This is the first such result in the literature for a non-Bayesian RMAB.',

	{'abstract': u'In the classic multi-armed bandits problem, the goal is to have a policy for dynamically operating arms that each yield stochastic rewards with unknown means. The key metric of interest is regret, defined as the gap between the expected total reward accumulated by an omniscient player that knows the reward means for each arm, and the expected total reward accumulated by the given policy. The policies presented in prior work have storage, computation and regret all growing linearly with the number of arms, which is not scalable when the number of arms is large. We consider in this work a broad class of multi-armed bandits with dependent arms that yield rewards as a linear combination of a set of unknown parameters. For this general framework, we present efficient policies that are shown to achieve regret that grows logarithmically with time, and polynomially in the number of unknown parameters (even though the number of dependent arms may grow exponentially). Furthermore, these policies only require storage that grows linearly in the number of unknown parameters. We show that this generalization is broadly applicable and useful for many interesting tasks in networks that can be formulated as tractable combinatorial optimization problems with linear objective functions, such as maximum weight matching, shortest path, and minimum spanning tree computations.',

	{'abstract': u'Category computation theory deals with a web-based systemic processing that underlies the morphic webs, which constitute the basis of categorial logical calculus. It is proven that, for these structures, algorithmically incompressible binary patterns can be morphically compressed, with respect to the local connectivities, in a binary morphic program. From the local connectivites, there emerges a global morphic connection that can be characterized by a low length binary string, leading to the identification of chaotic categorial dynamics, underlying the algorithmically random pattern. The work focuses on infinite binary chains of C2, which is a category that implements an X-OR-based categorial logical calculus.',

	{'abstract': u'We present asymptotic and finite-sample results on the use of stochastic blockmodels for the analysis of network data. We show that the fraction of misclassified network nodes converges in probability to zero under maximum likelihood fitting when the number of classes is allowed to grow as the root of the network size and the average network degree grows at least poly-logarithmically in this size. We also establish finite-sample confidence bounds on maximum-likelihood blockmodel parameter estimates from data comprising independent Bernoulli random variates; these results hold uniformly over class assignment. We provide simulations verifying the conditions sufficient for our results, and conclude by fitting a logit parameterization of a stochastic blockmodel with covariates to a network data example comprising a collection of Facebook profiles, resulting in block estimates that reveal residual structure.',

	{'abstract': u'Recent analysis of social communications among humans has revealed that the interval between interactions for a pair of individuals and for an individual often follows a long-tail distribution. We investigate the effect of such a non-Poissonian nature of human behavior on dynamics of opinion formation. We use a variant of the voter model and numerically compare the time to consensus of all the voters with different distributions of interevent intervals and different networks. Compared with the exponential distribution of interevent intervals (i.e., the standard voter model), the power-law distribution of interevent intervals slows down consensus on the ring. This is because of the memory effect; in the power-law case, the expected time until the next update event on a link is large if the link has not had an update event for a long time. On the complete graph, the consensus time in the power-law case is close to that in the exponential case. Regular graphs bridge these two results such that the slowing down of the consensus in the power-law case as compared to the exponential case is less pronounced as the degree increases.',

	{'abstract': u'In this paper we explore the concept of hierarchy as a quantifiable descriptor of ordered structures, departing from the definition of three conditions to be satisfied for a hierarchical structure: , and . According to these principles we define a hierarchical index taking concepts from graph and information theory. This estimator allows to quantify the hierarchical character of any system susceptible to be abstracted in a feedforward causal graph, i.e., a directed acyclic graph defined in a single connected structure. Our hierarchical index is a balance between this predictability and pyramidal condition by the definition of two entropies: one attending the onward flow and other for the backward reversion. We show how this index allows to identify hierarchical, anti-hierarchical and non hierarchical structures. Our formalism reveals that departing from the defined conditions for a hierarchical structure, feedforward trees and the inverted tree graphs emerge as the only causal structures of maximal hierarchical and anti-hierarchical systems, respectively. Conversely, null values of the hierarchical index are attributed to a number of different configuration networks; from linear chains, due to their lack of pyramid structure, to full-connected feedforward graphs where the diversity of onward pathways is canceled by the uncertainty (lack of predictability) when going backwards. Some illustrative examples are provided for the distinction among these three types of hierarchical causal graphs.',

	{'abstract': u'It is important to have fast and effective methods for simplifying 3-manifold triangulations without losing any topological information. In theory this is difficult: we might need to make a triangulation super-exponentially more complex before we can make it smaller than its original size. Here we present experimental work suggesting that for 3-sphere triangulations the reality is far different: we never need to add more than two tetrahedra, and we never need more than a handful of local modifications. If true in general, these extremely surprising results would have significant implications for decision algorithms and the study of triangulations in 3-manifold topology. The algorithms behind these experiments are interesting in their own right. Key techniques include the isomorph-free generation of all 3-manifold triangulations of a given size, polynomial-time computable signatures that identify triangulations uniquely up to isomorphism, and parallel algorithms for studying finite level sets in the infinite Pachner graph.',

By posing a suitable null hypothesis, our method makes use of the hypergeometric distribution to assess the probability that a given property is over-expressed in the elements of a community with respect to all the elements of the investigated set. We apply our method to two specific complex networks, namely a network of world movies and a network of physics preprints. The characterization of the elements and of the communities is done in terms of languages and countries for the movie network and of journals and subject categories for papers. We find that our method is able to characterize clearly the identified communities. Moreover our method works well both for large and for small communities.',

The best known classical algorithms for graph isomorphism all run in time super-polynomial in the size of the graph in the worst case. An interesting open problem is whether quantum computers can solve the graph isomorphism problem in polynomial time. In this paper, an algorithm is shown which can decide if two rooted trees are isomorphic in polynomial time. Although this problem is easy to solve efficiently on a classical computer, the techniques developed may be useful as a basis for quantum algorithms for deciding isomorphism of more interesting types of graphs. The related problem of quantum state symmetrization is also studied. A polynomial time algorithm for the problem of symmetrizing a set of orthonormal states over an arbitrary permutation group is shown.',

	{'abstract': u'String diagrams are a powerful tool for reasoning about physical processes, logic circuits, tensor networks, and many other compositional structures. The distinguishing feature of these diagrams is that edges need not be connected to vertices at both ends, and these unconnected ends can be interpreted as the inputs and outputs of a diagram. In this paper, we give a concrete construction for string diagrams using a special kind of typed graph called an open-graph. While the category of open-graphs is not itself adhesive, we introduce the notion of a selective adhesive functor, and show that such a functor embeds the category of open-graphs into the ambient adhesive category of typed graphs. Using this functor, the category of open-graphs inherits "enough adhesivity" from the category of typed graphs to perform double-pushout (DPO) graph rewriting. A salient feature of our theory is that it ensures rewrite systems are "type-safe" in the sense that rewriting respects the inputs and outputs. This formalism lets us safely encode the interesting structure of a computational model, such as evaluation dynamics, with succinct, explicit rewrite rules, while the graphical representation absorbs many of the tedious details. Although topological formalisms exist for string diagrams, our construction is discreet, finitary, and enjoys decidable algorithms for composition and rewriting. We also show how open-graphs can be parametrised by graphical signatures, similar to the monoidal signatures of Joyal and Street, which define types for vertices in the diagrammatic language and constraints on how they can be connected. Using typed open-graphs, we can construct free symmetric monoidal categories, PROPs, and more general monoidal theories. Thus open-graphs give us a handle for mechanised reasoning in monoidal categories.',

	{'abstract': u'The Magnetic Tower of Hanoi puzzle - a modified "base 3" version of the classical Tower of Hanoi puzzle as described in earlier papers, is actually a small set of independent sister-puzzles, depending on the "pre-coloring" combination of the tower\'s posts. Starting with Red facing up on a Source post, working through an Intermediate - colored or Neutral post, and ending Blue facing up on a Destination post, we identify the different pre-coloring combinations in (S,I,D) order. The Tower\'s pre-coloring combinations are . In this paper we investigate these sister-puzzles, identify the algorithm that optimally solves each pre-colored puzzle, and prove its Optimality. As it turns out, five of the six algorithms, challenging on their own, are part of the algorithm solving the "natural", Free Magnetic Tower of Hanoi puzzle [N,N,N]. We start by showing that the N-disk Colored Tower [(R,B,B) / (R,R,B)] is solved by (3^N - 1)/2 moves. Defining "Algorithm Duration" as the ratio of number of algorithm-moves solving the puzzle to the number of algorithm-moves solving the Colored Tower, we find the Duration-Limits for all sister-puzzles. In the order of the list above they are . Thus, the Duration-Limit of the Optimal Algorithm solving the Free Magnetic Tower of Hanoi puzzle is 20/33 or 606 0/00. On the road to optimally solve this colorful Magnetic puzzle, we hit other "forward-moving" puzzle-solving algorithms. Overall we looked at 10 pairs of integer sequences. Of the twenty integer sequences, five are listed in the On-line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences, the other fifteen - not yet. The large set of different solutions is a clear indication to the freedom-of-wondering that makes this Magnetic Tower of Hanoi puzzle so colorful.',

	{'abstract': u"The well-known Ising model used in statistical physics was adapted to a social dynamics context to simulate the adoption of a technological innovation. The model explicitly combines (a) an individual's perception of the advantages of an innovation and (b) social influence from members of the decision-maker's social network. The micro-level adoption dynamics are embedded into an agent-based model that allows exploration of macro-level patterns of technology diffusion throughout systems with different configurations (number and distributions of early adopters, social network topologies). In the present work we carry out many numerical simulations. We find that when the gap between the individual's perception of the options is high, the adoption speed increases if the dispersion of early adopters grows. Another test was based on changing the network topology by means of stochastic connections to a common opinion reference (hub), which resulted in an increment in the adoption speed. Finally, we performed a simulation of competition between options for both regular and small world networks.",

	{'abstract': u"We study a random code ensemble with a hierarchical structure, which is closely related to the generalized random energy model with discrete energy values. Based on this correspondence, we analyze the hierarchical random code ensemble by using the replica method in two situations: lossy data compression and channel coding. For both the situations, the exponents of large deviation analysis characterizing the performance of the ensemble, the distortion rate of lossy data compression and the error exponent of channel coding in Gallager's formalism, are accessible by a generating function of the generalized random energy model. We discuss that the transitions of those exponents observed in the preceding work can be interpreted as phase transitions with respect to the replica number. We also show that the replica symmetry breaking plays an essential role in these transitions.",

	{'abstract': u'Mean-field analysis is an important tool for understanding dynamics on complex networks. However, surprisingly little attention has been paid to the question of whether mean-field predictions are accurate, and this is particularly true for real-world networks with clustering and modular structure. In this paper, we compare mean-field predictions to numerical simulation results for dynamical processes running on 21 real-world networks and demonstrate that the accuracy of the theory depends not only on the mean degree of the networks but also on the mean first-neighbor degree. We show that mean-field theory can give (unexpectedly) accurate results for certain dynamics on disassortative real-world networks even when the mean degree is as low as 4.',

	{'abstract': u'We study a complementarity game as a systematic tool for the investigation of the interplay between individual optimization and population effects and for the comparison of different strategy and learning schemes. The game randomly pairs players from opposite populations. The game is symmetric at the individual level, but has many equilibria that are more or less favorable to the members of the two populations. Which of these equilibria then is attained is decided by the dynamics at the population level. Players play repeatedly, but in each round with a new opponent. They can learn from their previous encounters and translate this into their actions in the present round on the basis of strategic schemes. The schemes can be quite simple, or very elaborate. We can then break the symmetry in the game and give the members of the two populations access to different strategy spaces. Typically, simpler strategy types have an advantage because they tend to go more quickly towards a favorable equilibrium which, once reached, the other population is forced to accept. Also, populations with bolder individuals that may not fare so well at the level of individual performance may obtain an advantage towards ones with more timid players. By checking the effects of parameters such as the generation length or the mutation rate, we are able to compare the relative contributions of individual learning and evolutionary adaptations.',

	{'abstract': u"We study a complementarity game with multiple populations whose members' offered contributions are put together towards some common aim. When the sum of the players' offers reaches or exceeds some threshold K, they each receive K minus their own offers. Else, they all receive nothing. Each player tries to offer as little as possible, hoping that the sum of the contributions still reaches K, however. The game is symmetric at the individual level, but has many equilibria that are more or less favorable to the members of certain populations. In particular, it is possible that the members of one or several populations do not contribute anything, a behavior called defecting, while the others still contribute enough to reach the threshold. Which of these equilibria then is attained is decided by the dynamics at the population level that in turn depends on the strategic options the players possess. We find that defecting occurs when more than 3 populations participate in the game, even when the strategy scheme employed is very simple, if certain conditions for the system parameters are satisfied. The results are obtained through systematic simulations.",

	{'abstract': u'We draw a certain analogy between the classical information-theoretic problem of lossy data compression (source coding) of memoryless information sources and the statistical mechanical behavior of a certain model of a chain of connected particles (e.g., a polymer) that is subjected to a contracting force. The free energy difference pertaining to such a contraction turns out to be proportional to the rate-distortion function in the analogous data compression model, and the contracting force is proportional to the derivative this function. Beyond the fact that this analogy may be interesting on its own right, it may provide a physical perspective on the behavior of optimum schemes for lossy data compression (and perhaps also, an information-theoretic perspective on certain physical system models). Moreover, it triggers the derivation of lossy compression performance for systems with memory, using analysis tools and insights from statistical mechanics.',

	{'abstract': u'Inference and learning of graphical models are both well-studied problems in statistics and machine learning that have found many applications in science and engineering. However, exact inference is intractable in general graphical models, which suggests the problem of seeking the best approximation to a collection of random variables within some tractable family of graphical models. In this paper, we focus our attention on the class of planar Ising models, for which inference is tractable using techniques of statistical physics [Kac and Ward; Kasteleyn]. Based on these techniques and recent methods for planarity testing and planar embedding [Chrobak and Payne], we propose a simple greedy algorithm for learning the best planar Ising model to approximate an arbitrary collection of binary random variables (possibly from sample data). Given the set of all pairwise correlations among variables, we select a planar graph and optimal planar Ising model defined on this graph to best approximate that set of correlations. We demonstrate our method in some simulations and for the application of modeling senate voting records.',

It is a long standing open problem, whether or not the ideals of any poset can be generated in constant amortized time, CAT for short. We refine the tree traversal, a method introduced by Pruesse and Ruskey in 1993, to obtain a CAT-generator for two large classes of posets: posets of interval dimension at most two and so called locally planar posets. This includes all posets for which a CAT-generator was known before. Posets of interval dimension at most two generalize both, interval orders and 2-dimensional posets. Locally planar posets generalize for example posets with a planar cover graph. We apply our results to CAT-generate all c-orientations of a planar graph. As a special case this is a CAT-generator for many combinatorial objects like domino and lozenge tilings, planar spanning trees, planar bipartite perfect matchings, Schnyder woods, and others.',

From these new bounds it follows that for q &lt;= 2593 and q=2693,2753, the relation t_(2,q) &lt; 4.5 sqrt holds. Also, for q &lt;= 4561 we have t_(2,q) &lt; 4.75 sqrt. It is showed that for 23 &lt;= q &lt;= 4561 and q in T2 cup ,2^,2^, the inequality t_(2,q) &lt; sqrtln^q is true. Moreover, the results obtained allow us to conjecture that this estimate holds for all q &gt;= 23. The new upper bounds are obtained by finding new small complete arcs with the help of a computer search using randomized greedy algorithms. Also new constructions of complete arcs are proposed. These constructions form families of k-arcs in PG(2,q) containing arcs of all sizes k in a region k_ &lt;= k &lt;= k_ where k_ is of order q/3 or q/4 while k_ has order q/2. The completeness of the arcs obtained by the new constructions is proved for q &lt;= 1367 and 2003 &lt;= q &lt;= 2063. There is reason to suppose that the arcs are complete for all q &gt; 1367.

In this work we investigate the performance of quark solver using the restricted additive Schwarz (RAS) preconditioner on a low cost GPU cluster. We expect that the RAS preconditioner with appropriate domaindecomposition and task distribution reduces the communication bottleneck. The GPU cluster we constructed is composed of four PC boxes, two GPU cards are attached to each box, and we have eight GPU cards in total. The compute nodes are connected with rather slow but low cost Gigabit-Ethernet. We include the RAS preconditioner in the single-precision part of the mixedprecision nested-BiCGStab algorithm and the single-precision task is distributed to the multiple GPUs. The benchmarking is done with the O(a)-improved Wilson quark on a randomly generated gauge configuration with the size of . We observe a factor two improvment on the solver performance with the RAS precoditioner compared to that without the preconditioner and find that the improvment mainly comes from the reduction of the communication bottleneck as we expected.',

	{'abstract': u'An important step in unveiling the relation between network structure and dynamics defined on networks is to detect communities, and numerous methods have been developed separately to identify community structure in different classes of networks, such as unipartite networks, bipartite networks, and directed networks. We show that both unipartite and directed networks can be represented as bipartite networks, and their modularity is completely consistent with that for bipartite networks, the detection of modular structure on which can be reformulated as modularity maximization. To optimize the bipartite modularity, we develop a modified adaptive genetic algorithm (MAGA), which is shown to be especially efficient for community structure detection. The high efficiency of the MAGA is based on the following three improvements we make. First, we introduce a different measure for the informativeness of a locus instead of the standard deviation, which can exactly determine which loci mutate. This measure is the bias between the distribution of a locus over the current population and the uniform distribution of the locus, i.e., the Kullback-Leibler divergence between them. Second, we develop a reassignment technique for differentiating the informative state a locus has attained from the random state in the initial phase. Third, we present a modified mutation rule which by incorporating related operation can guarantee the convergence of the MAGA to the global optimum and can speed up the convergence process. Experimental results show that the MAGA outperforms existing methods in terms of modularity for both bipartite and unipartite networks.',

	{'abstract': u'We give new evidence that quantum computers -- moreover, rudimentary quantum computers built entirely out of linear-optical elements -- cannot be efficiently simulated by classical computers. In particular, we define a model of computation in which identical photons are generated, sent through a linear-optical network, then nonadaptively measured to count the number of photons in each mode. This model is not known or believed to be universal for quantum computation, and indeed, we discuss the prospects for realizing the model using current technology. On the other hand, we prove that the model is able to solve sampling problems and search problems that are classically intractable under plausible assumptions. Our first result says that, if there exists a polynomial-time classical algorithm that samples from the same probability distribution as a linear-optical network, then P^#P=BPP^NP, and hence the polynomial hierarchy collapses to the third level. Unfortunately, this result assumes an extremely accurate simulation. Our main result suggests that even an approximate or noisy classical simulation would already imply a collapse of the polynomial hierarchy. For this, we need two unproven conjectures: the "Permanent-of-Gaussians Conjecture", which says that it is #P-hard to approximate the permanent of a matrix A of independent N(0,1) Gaussian entries, with high probability over A; and the "Permanent Anti-Concentration Conjecture", which says that |Per(A)|&gt;=sqrt(n!)/poly(n) with high probability over A. We present evidence for these conjectures, both of which seem interesting even apart from our application. This paper does not assume knowledge of quantum optics. Indeed, part of its goal is to develop the beautiful theory of noninteracting bosons underlying our model, and its connection to the permanent function, in a self-contained way accessible to theoretical computer scientists.',

	{'abstract': u'The development of discursive knowledge presumes the communication of meaning as analytically different from the communication of information. Knowledge can then be considered as a meaning which makes a difference. Whereas the communication of information is studied in the information sciences and scientometrics, the communication of meaning has been central to Luhmann\'s attempts to make the theory of autopoiesis relevant for sociology. Analytical techniques such as semantic maps and the simulation of anticipatory systems enable us to operationalize the distinctions which Luhmann proposed as relevant to the elaboration of Husserl\'s "horizons of meaning" in empirical research: interactions among communications, the organization of meaning in instantiations, and the self-organization of interhuman communication in terms of symbolically generalized media such as truth, love, and power. Horizons of meaning, however, remain uncertain orders of expectations, and one should caution against reification from the meta-biological perspective of systems theory.',

Our framework simultaneously captures such well-known notions as internal and general Phi-regret, learning with non-additive global cost functions, Blackwell's approachability, calibration of forecasters, adaptive regret, and more. We show that learnability in all these situations is due to control of the same three quantities: a martingale convergence term, a term describing the ability to perform well if future is known, and a generalization of sequential Rademacher complexity, studied in (Rakhlin, Sridharan, Tewari, 2010).

	{'abstract': u'Algorithms have two costs: arithmetic and communication. The latter represents the cost of moving data, either between levels of a memory hierarchy, or between processors over a network. Communication often dominates arithmetic and represents a rapidly increasing proportion of the total cost, so we seek algorithms that minimize communication. In cite lower bounds were presented on the amount of communication required for essentially all -like algorithms for linear algebra, including eigenvalue problems and the SVD. Conventional algorithms, including those currently implemented in (Sca)LAPACK, perform asymptotically more communication than these lower bounds require. In this paper we present parallel and sequential eigenvalue algorithms (for pencils, nonsymmetric matrices, and symmetric matrices) and SVD algorithms that do attain these lower bounds, and analyze their convergence and communication costs.',

	{'abstract': u'In this paper we study the generalized version of weighted matching in bipartite networks. Consider a weighted matching in a bipartite network in which the nodes derive value from the split of the matching edge assigned to them if they are matched. The value a node derives from the split depends both on the split as well as the partner the node is matched to. We assume that the value of a split to the node is continuous and strictly increasing in the part of the split assigned to the node. A stable weighted matching is a matching and splits on the edges in the matching such that no two adjacent nodes in the network can split the edge between them so that both of them can derive a higher value than in the matching. We extend the weighted matching problem to this general case and study the existence of a stable weighted matching. We also present an algorithm that converges to a stable weighted matching. The algorithm generalizes the Hungarian algorithm for bipartite matching. Faster algorithms can be made when there is more structure on the value functions.',

Probabilities as small as 10^-180 are accessed using an artificial finite-temperature (Boltzmann) ensemble. The distributions for the Erdoes-Renyi ensemble agree well with previously obtained analytical results. The results for the percolation problem, where no analytical results are available, are qualitatively similar, but the shapes of the distributions are somehow different and the finite-size corrections are sometimes much larger. Furthermore, for both problems, a first-order phase transition at low temperatures T within the artificial ensemble is found in the percolating regime, respectively.',

The model is a linear system affected by a disturbance term: this represents a large class of technological faulty processes. The goal is to make the system able to tolerate the undesired perturbation, i.e., to remove or at least reduce its negative effects; such a task is performed in three steps: the detection of the fault, its identification and the consequent process recovery. When the disturbance function is known to be emph over a finite number of levels, the detection can be successfully executed by a recursive emph algorithm, arising from Information and Coding Theory and suitably adapted to the control framework. This technique is analyzed and tested in a flight control issue; both theoretical considerations and simulations are reported.',

	{'abstract': u'Describing the collective activity of neural populations is a daunting task: the number of possible patterns grows exponentially with the number of cells, resulting in practically unlimited complexity. Recent empirical studies, however, suggest a vast simplification in how multi-neuron spiking occurs: the activity patterns of some circuits are nearly completely captured by pairwise interactions among neurons. Why are such pairwise models so successful in some instances, but insufficient in others? Here, we study the emergence of higher-order interactions in simple circuits with different architectures and inputs. We quantify the impact of higher-order interactions by comparing the responses of mechanistic circuit models vs. "null" descriptions in which all higher-than-pairwise correlations have been accounted for by lower order statistics, known as pairwise maximum entropy models. We find that bimodal input signals produce larger deviations from pairwise predictions than unimodal inputs for circuits with local and global connectivity. Moreover, recurrent coupling can accentuate these deviations, if coupling strengths are neither too weak nor too strong. A circuit model based on intracellular recordings from ON parasol retinal ganglion cells shows that a broad range of light signals induce unimodal inputs to spike generators, and that coupling strengths produce weak effects on higher-order interactions. This provides a novel explanation for the success of pairwise models in this system. Overall, our findings identify circuit-level mechanisms that produce and fail to produce higher-order spiking statistics in neural ensembles.',

	{'abstract': u'This paper presents an efficient parallel approximation scheme for a new class of min-max problems. The algorithm is derived from the matrix multiplicative weights update method and can be used to find near-optimal strategies for competitive two-party classical or quantum interactions in which a referee exchanges any number of messages with one party followed by any number of additional messages with the other. It considerably extends the class of interactions which admit parallel solutions, demonstrating for the first time the existence of a parallel algorithm for an interaction in which one party reacts adaptively to the other. As a consequence, we prove that several competing-provers complexity classes collapse to PSPACE such as QRG(2), SQG and two new classes called DIP and DQIP. A special case of our result is a parallel approximation scheme for a specific class of semidefinite programs whose feasible region consists of lists of semidefinite matrices that satisfy a transcript-like consistency condition. Applied to this special case, our algorithm yields a direct polynomial-space simulation of multi-message quantum interactive proofs resulting in a first-principles proof of QIP=PSPACE.',

	{'abstract': u'Contact processes describe the transmission of distinct properties of nodes via the links of a network. They provide a simple framework for many phenomena, such as epidemic spreading and opinion formation. Combining contact processes with rules for topological evolution yields an adaptive network in which the states of the nodes can interact dynamically with the topological degrees of freedom. By moment-closure approximation it is possible to derive low-dimensional systems of ordinary differential equations that describe the dynamics of the adaptive network on a coarse-grained level. In this chapter we discuss the approximation technique itself as well as its applications to adaptive networks. Thus, it can serve both as a tutorial as well as a review of recent results.',

	{'abstract': u'Complex sequencing rules observed in birdsongs provide an opportunity to investigate the neural mechanism for generating complex sequential behaviors. To relate the findings from studying birdsongs to other sequential behaviors, it is crucial to characterize the statistical properties of the sequencing rules in birdsongs. However, the properties of the sequencing rules in birdsongs have not yet been fully addressed. In this study, we investigate the statistical propertiesof the complex birdsong of the Bengalese finch (Lonchura striata var. domestica). Based on manual-annotated syllable sequences, we first show that there are significant higher-order context dependencies in Bengalese finch songs, that is, which syllable appears next depends on more than one previous syllable. This property is shared with other complex sequential behaviors. We then analyze acoustic features of the song and show that higher-order context dependencies can be explained using first-order hidden state transition dynamics with redundant hidden states. This model corresponds to hidden Markov models (HMMs), well known statistical models with a large range of application for time series modeling. The song annotation with these models with first-order hidden state dynamics agreed well with manual annotation, the score was comparable to that of a second-order HMM, and surpassed the zeroth-order model (the Gaussian mixture model (GMM)), which does not use context information. Our results imply that the hierarchical representation with hidden state dynamics may underlie the neural implementation for generating complex sequences with higher-order dependencies.',

	{'abstract': u'We study a general class of PageRank optimization problems which consist in finding an optimal outlink strategy for a web site subject to design constraints. We consider both a continuous problem, in which one can choose the intensity of a link, and a discrete one, in which in each page, there are obligatory links, facultative links and forbidden links. We show that the continuous problem, as well as its discrete variant when there are no constraints coupling different pages, can both be modeled by constrained Markov decision processes with ergodic reward, in which the webmaster determines the transition probabilities of websurfers. Although the number of actions turns out to be exponential, we show that an associated polytope of transition measures has a concise representation, from which we deduce that the continuous problem is solvable in polynomial time, and that the same is true for the discrete problem when there are no coupling constraints. We also provide efficient algorithms, adapted to very large networks. Then, we investigate the qualitative features of optimal outlink strategies, and identify in particular assumptions under which there exists a "master" page to which all controlled pages should point. We report numerical results on fragments of the real web graph.',

	{'abstract': u'We transpose an optimal control technique to the image segmentation problem. The idea is to consider image segmentation as a parameter estimation problem. The parameter to estimate is the color of the pixels of the image. We use the adaptive parameterization technique which builds iteratively an optimal representation of the parameter into uniform regions that form a partition of the domain, hence corresponding to a segmentation of the image. We minimize an error function during the iterations, and the partition of the image into regions is optimally driven by the gradient of this error. The resulting segmentation algorithm inherits desirable properties from its optimal control origin: soundness, robustness, and flexibility.',

	{'abstract': u'As research into community finding in social networks progresses, there is a need for algorithms capable of detecting overlapping community structure. Many algorithms have been proposed in recent years that are capable of assigning each node to more than a single community. The performance of these algorithms tends to degrade when the ground-truth contains a more highly overlapping community structure, with nodes assigned to more than two communities. Such highly overlapping structure is likely to exist in many social networks, such as Facebook friendship networks. In this paper we present a scalable algorithm, MOSES, based on a statistical model of community structure, which is capable of detecting highly overlapping community structure, especially when there is variance in the number of communities each node is in. In evaluation on synthetic data MOSES is found to be superior to existing algorithms, especially at high levels of overlap. We demonstrate MOSES on real social network data by analyzing the networks of friendship links between students of five US universities.',

	{'abstract': u'We consider the problem of digital halftoning from the view point of statistical mechanics. The digital halftoning is a sort of image processing, namely, representing each grayscale in terms of black and white binary dots. The digital halftoning is achieved by making use of the threshold mask, namely, for each pixel, the halftoned binary pixel is determined as black if the original grayscale pixel is greater than or equal to the mask value and is determined as white vice versa. To determine the optimal value of the mask on each pixel for a given original grayscale image, we first assume that the human-eyes might recognize the black and white binary halftoned image as the corresponding grayscale one by linear filters. The Hamiltonian is constructed as a distance between the original and the recognized images which is written in terms of the threshold mask. We are confirmed that the system described by the Hamiltonian is regarded as a kind of antiferromagnetic Ising model with quenched disorders. By searching the ground state of the Hamiltonian, we obtain the optimal threshold mask and the resulting halftoned binary dots simultaneously. From the power-spectrum analysis, we find that the binary dots image is physiologically plausible from the view point of human-eyes modulation properties. We also propose a theoretical framework to investigate statistical performance of inverse digital halftoning, that is, the inverse process of halftoning. From the Bayesian inference view point, we rigorously show that the Bayes-optimal inverse-halftoning is achieved on a specific condition which is very similar to the so-called Nishimori line in the research field of spin glasses.',

	{'abstract': u"The electrical power network is a critical infrastructure in today's society, so its safe and reliable operation is of major concern. State estimators are commonly used in power networks, for example, to detect faulty equipment and to optimally route power flows. The estimators are often located in control centers, to which large numbers of measurements are sent over unencrypted communication channels. Therefore cyber security for state estimators becomes an important issue. In this paper we analyze the cyber security of state estimators in supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) for energy management systems (EMS) operating the power network. Current EMS state estimation algorithms have bad data detection (BDD) schemes to detect outliers in the measurement data. Such schemes are based on high measurement redundancy. Although these methods may detect a set of basic cyber attacks, they may fail in the presence of an intelligent attacker. We explore the latter by considering scenarios where stealthy deception attacks are performed by sending false information to the control center. We begin by presenting a recent framework that characterizes the attack as an optimization problem with the objective specified through a security metric and constraints corresponding to the attack cost. The framework is used to conduct realistic experiments on a state-of-the-art SCADA EMS software for a power network example with 14 substations, 27 buses, and 40 branches. The results indicate how state estimators for power networks can be made more resilient to cyber security attacks.",

	{'abstract': u'Grothendieck inequalities are fundamental inequalities which are frequently used in many areas of mathematics and computer science. They can be interpreted as upper bounds for the integrality gap between two optimization problems: a difficult semidefinite program with rank-1 constraint and its easy semidefinite relaxation where the rank constrained is dropped. For instance, the integrality gap of the Goemans-Williamson approximation algorithm for MAX CUT can be seen as a Grothendieck inequality. In this paper we consider Grothendieck inequalities for ranks greater than 1 and we give two applications: approximating ground states in the n-vector model in statistical mechanics and XOR games in quantum information theory.',

	{'abstract': u'Network data often take the form of repeated interactions between senders and receivers tabulated over time. A primary question to ask of such data is which traits and behaviors are predictive of interaction. To answer this question, a model is introduced for treating directed interactions as a multivariate point process: a Cox multiplicative intensity model using covariates that depend on the history of the process. Consistency and asymptotic normality are proved for the resulting partial-likelihood-based estimators under suitable regularity conditions, and an efficient fitting procedure is described. Multicast interactions--those involving a single sender but multiple receivers--are treated explicitly. The resulting inferential framework is then employed to model message sending behavior in a corporate e-mail network. The analysis gives a precise quantification of which static shared traits and dynamic network effects are predictive of message recipient selection.',

	{'abstract': u"This article concerns the computational problem of counting the lattice points inside convex polytopes, when each point must be counted with a weight associated to it. We describe an efficient algorithm for computing the highest degree coefficients of the weighted Ehrhart quasi-polynomial for a rational simple polytope in varying dimension, when the weights of the lattice points are given by a polynomial function h. Our technique is based on a refinement of an algorithm of A. Barvinok [Computing the Ehrhart quasi-polynomial of a rational simplex, Math. Comp. 75 (2006), pp. 1449--1466] in the unweighted case (i.e., h = 1). In contrast to Barvinok's method, our method is local, obtains an approximation on the level of generating functions, handles the general weighted case, and provides the coefficients in closed form as step polynomials of the dilation. To demonstrate the practicality of our approach we report on computational experiments which show even our simple implementation can compete with state of the art software.",

Logarithmic binning retrieves information and trends "not visible" in noisy power-law tails. We also argue that obtaining the exponent from logarithmically binned data using a simple least square method is in some cases warranted in addition to methods such as the maximum likelihood. We also show why often used cumulative distributions can make it difficult to distinguish noise from genuine features, and make it difficult to obtain an accurate power-law exponent of the underlying distribution. The treatment is non-technical, aimed at IS researchers with little or no background in mathematics.',

	{'abstract': u'Suppose a given observation matrix can be decomposed as the sum of a low-rank matrix and a sparse matrix (outliers), and the goal is to recover these individual components from the observed sum. Such additive decompositions have applications in a variety of numerical problems including system identification, latent variable graphical modeling, and principal components analysis. We study conditions under which recovering such a decomposition is possible via a combination of norm and trace norm minimization. We are specifically interested in the question of how many outliers are allowed so that convex programming can still achieve accurate recovery, and we obtain stronger recovery guarantees than previous studies. Moreover, we do not assume that the spatial pattern of outliers is random, which stands in contrast to related analyses under such assumptions via matrix completion.',

To establish this, we prove an adversary lower bound using a detailed analysis of the structure of minor-closed properties with respect to forbidden topological minors and forbidden subgraphs. On the other hand, we show that minor-closed properties (and more generally, sparse graph properties) that can be characterized by finitely many forbidden subgraphs can be solved strictly faster, in o(n^) queries.

	{'abstract': u"The Rock-Paper-Scissors(RPS) game is a paradigmatic model for cyclic dominance in biological systems. Here we consider this game in the social context of competition between opinions in a networked society. In our model, every agent has an opinion which is drawn from the three choices: rock, paper or scissors. In every timestep a link is selected randomly and the game is played between the nodes connected by the link. The loser either adopts the opinion of the winner or rewires the link. These rules define an adaptive network on which the agent's opinions coevolve with the network topology of social contacts. We show analytically and numerically that nonequilibrium phase transitions occur as a function of the rewiring strength. The transitions separate four distinct phases which differ in the observed dynamics of opinions and topology. In particular, there is one phase where the population settles to an arbitrary consensus opinion. We present a detailed analysis of the corresponding transitions revealing an apparently paradoxial behavior. The system approaches consensus states where they are unstable, whereas other dynamics prevail when the consensus states are stable.",

Here we study these games by extensive numerical simulation on networked social structures using an evolutionary approach. We show that local network effects may promote selection of efficient equilibria in both pure and general coordination games and may explain social polarization. These results are put into perspective with respect to known theoretical results. The main insight we obtain is that clustering, and especially community structure in social networks has a positive role in promoting socially efficient outcomes.',

	{'abstract': u'Spectral clustering is one of the most widely used techniques for extracting the underlying global structure of a data set. Compressed sensing and matrix completion have emerged as prevailing methods for efficiently recovering sparse and partially observed signals respectively. We combine the distance preserving measurements of compressed sensing and matrix completion with the power of robust spectral clustering. Our analysis provides rigorous bounds on how small errors in the affinity matrix can affect the spectral coordinates and clusterability. This work generalizes the current perturbation results of two-class spectral clustering to incorporate multi-class clustering with k eigenvectors. We thoroughly track how small perturbation from using compressed sensing and matrix completion affect the affinity matrix and in succession the spectral coordinates. These perturbation results for multi-class clustering require an eigengap between the kth and (k+1)th eigenvalues of the affinity matrix, which naturally occurs in data with k well-defined clusters. Our theoretical guarantees are complemented with numerical results along with a number of examples of the unsupervised organization and clustering of image data.',

	{'abstract': u'We resolve the question of optimality for a well-studied packetized implementation of random linear network coding, called PNC. In PNC, in contrast to the classical memoryless setting, nodes store received information in memory to later produce coded packets that reflect this information. PNC is known to achieve order optimal stopping times for the many-to-all multicast problem in many settings. We give a reduction that captures exactly how PNC and other network coding protocols use the memory of the nodes. More precisely, we show that any such protocol implementation induces a transformation which maps an execution of the protocol to an instance of the classical memoryless setting. This allows us to prove that, for any (non-adaptive dynamic) network, PNC converges with high probability in optimal time. In other words, it stops at exactly the first time in which in hindsight it was possible to route information from the sources to each receiver individually. Our technique also applies to variants of PNC, in which each node uses only a finite buffer. We show that, even in this setting, PNC stops exactly within the time in which in hindsight it was possible to route packets given the memory constraint, i.e., that the memory used at each node never exceeds its buffer size. This shows that PNC, even without any feedback or explicit memory management, allows to keep minimal buffer sizes while maintaining its capacity achieving performance.',

	{'abstract': u'Traditional spectral clustering methods cannot naturally learn the number of communities in a network and often fail to detect smaller community structure in dense networks because they are based upon external community connectivity properties such as graph cuts. We propose an algorithm for detecting community structure in networks called the leader-follower algorithm which is based upon the natural internal structure expected of communities in social networks. The algorithm uses the notion of network centrality in a novel manner to differentiate leaders (nodes which connect different communities) from loyal followers (nodes which only have neighbors within a single community). Using this approach, it is able to naturally learn the communities from the network structure and does not require the number of communities as an input, in contrast to other common methods such as spectral clustering. We prove that it will detect all of the communities exactly for any network possessing communities with the natural internal structure expected in social networks. More importantly, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the leader-follower algorithm in the context of various real networks ranging from social networks such as Facebook to biological networks such as an fMRI based human brain network. We find that the leader-follower algorithm finds the relevant community structure in these networks without knowing the number of communities beforehand. Also, because the leader-follower algorithm detects communities using their internal structure, we find that it can resolve a finer community structure in dense networks than common spectral clustering methods based on external community structure.',

	{'abstract': u"In this article we consider the inversion problem for polynomially computable discrete functions. These functions describe behavior of many discrete systems and are used in model checking, hardware verification, cryptanalysis, computer biology and other domains. Quite often it is necessary to invert these functions, i.e. to find an unknown preimage if an image and algorithm of function computation are given. In general case this problem is computationally intractable. However, many of it's special cases are very important in practical applications. Thus development of algorithms that are applicable to these special cases is of importance. The practical applicability of such algorithms can be validated by their ability to solve the problems that are considered to be computationally hard (for example cryptanalysis problems). In this article we propose the technology of solving the inversion problem for polynomially computable discrete functions. This technology was implemented in distributed computing environments (parallel clusters and Grid-systems). It is based on reducing the inversion problem for the considered function to some SAT problem. We describe a general approach to coarse-grained parallelization for obtained SAT problems. Efficiency of each parallelization scheme is determined by the means of a special predictive function. The proposed technology was validated by successful solving of cryptanalysis problems for some keystream generators. The main practical result of this work is a complete cryptanalysis of keystream generator A5/1 which was performed in a Grid system specially built for this task.",

We take into account the impact of these decisions on the behavior of intelligent mobile terminals who can connect to the base station that offers the best utility. The signal to interference and noise ratio is used as the quantity that determines the association. We first study the SINR association-game: we determine the cells corresponding to each base stations, i.e., the locations at which mobile terminals prefer to connect to a given base station than to others. We make some surprising observations: (i) displacing a base station a little in one direction may result in a displacement of the boundary of the corresponding cell to the opposite direction; (ii) A cell corresponding to a BS may be the union of disconnected sub-cells. We then study the hierarchical equilibrium in the combined BS location and mobile association problem: we determine where to locate the BSs so as to maximize the revenues obtained at the induced SINR mobile association game. We consider the cases of single frequency band and two frequency bands of operation. Finally, we also consider hierarchical equilibria in two frequency systems with successive interference cancellation.',

We map this problem to the propagation of multiple random walkers on directed networks and we evaluate the inter-arrival time distribution between successive walkers arriving at a target. We show that the temporal organization of this process, which models information propagation on unstructured peer to peer networks, has the same features as SPAM arriving to a single user. We study the behavior of the message inter-arrival time distribution on three different network topologies using two different rules for sending messages. In all networks the propagation is not a pure Poisson process. It shows universal features on Poissonian networks and a more complex behavior on scale free networks. Results open the possibility to indirectly learn about the process of sending messages on networks with unknown topologies, by studying inter-arrival times at any node of the network.',

	{'abstract': u'The paper introduces an original MAC protocol for a passive optical metropolitan area network using time-domain wavelength interleaved networking (TWIN)% as proposed recently by Bell Labs . Optical channels are shared under the distributed control of destinations using a packet-based polling algorithm. This MAC is inspired more by EPON dynamic bandwidth allocation than the slotted, GPON-like access control generally envisaged for TWIN. Management of source-destination traffic streams is flow-aware with the size of allocated time slices being proportional to the number of active flows. This emulates a network-wide, distributed fair queuing scheduler, bringing the well-known implicit service differentiation and robustness advantages of this mechanism to the metro area network. The paper presents a comprehensive performance evaluation based on analytical modelling supported by simulations. The proposed MAC is shown to have excellent performance in terms of both traffic capacity and packet latency.',

	{'abstract': u'The rainbow connection number, rc(G), of a connected graph G is the minimum number of colours needed to colour its edges, so that every pair of its vertices is connected by at least one path in which no two edges are coloured the same. In this note we show that for every bridgeless graph G with radius r, rc(G) &lt;= r(r + 2). We demonstrate that this bound is the best possible for rc(G) as a function of r, not just for bridgeless graphs, but also for graphs of any stronger connectivity. It may be noted that for a general 1-connected graph G, rc(G) can be arbitrarily larger than its radius (Star graph for instance). We further show that for every bridgeless graph G with radius r and chordality (size of a largest induced cycle) k, rc(G) &lt;= rk. It is known that computing rc(G) is NP-Hard [Chakraborty et al., 2009]. Here, we present a (r+3)-factor approximation algorithm which runs in O(nm) time and a (d+3)-factor approximation algorithm which runs in O(dm) time to rainbow colour any connected graph G on n vertices, with m edges, diameter d and radius r.',

	{'abstract': u"In a recent paper from SODA11 cite the authors introduced a general framework for exponential time improvement of minwise based algorithms by defining and constructing almost kmin independent family of hash functions. Here we take it a step forward and reduce the space and the independent needed for representing the functions, by defining and constructing a dkmin independent family of hash functions. Surprisingly, for most cases only 8-wise independent is needed for exponential time and space improvement. Moreover, we bypass the independent lower bound for approximately minwise functions cite, as we use alternative definition. In addition, as the independent's degree is a small constant it can be implemented efficiently. Informally, under this definition, all subsets of size of any fixed set have an equal probability to have hash values among the minimal values in , where the probability is over the random choice of hash function from the family. This property measures the randomness of the family, as choosing a truly random function, obviously, satisfies the definition for . We define and give an efficient time and space construction of approximately dkmin independent family of hash functions. The degree of independent required is optimal, i.e. only for , where is the desired error bound. This construction can be used to improve many minwise based algorithms, such as cite, as will be discussed here. To our knowledge such definitions, for hash functions, were never studied and no construction was given before.",

	{'abstract': u'This paper considers deployment problems where a mobile robotic network must optimize its configuration in a distributed way in order to minimize a steady-state cost function that depends on the spatial distribution of certain probabilistic events of interest. Moreover, it is assumed that the event location distribution is a priori unknown, and can only be progressively inferred from the observation of the actual event occurrences. Three classes of problems are discussed in detail: coverage control problems, spatial partitioning problems, and dynamic vehicle routing problems. In each case, distributed stochastic gradient algorithms optimizing the performance objective are presented. The stochastic gradient view simplifies and generalizes previously proposed solutions, and is applicable to new complex scenarios, such as adaptive coverage involving heterogeneous agents. Remarkably, these algorithms often take the form of simple distributed rules that could be implemented on resource-limited platforms.',

The experiment was performed using a measuring infrastructure RIPE test box, ensuring precision accuracy. The experimental results showed that to increase the accuracy of available bandwidth, we need to neutralize the effect of the variable part of the delay by increasing the number of measurements. Finally, we made the computer simulation, which allowed us to establish a dependence between the measurement error of the available bandwidth and the number of measurements.',

CERTPLC can handle PLC descriptions provided in the Sequential Function Chart (SFC) language of the IEC 61131-3 standard. It provides routines to certify properties of systems by delivering an independently checkable formal system description and proof (called certificate) for the desired properties. We focus on properties that can be described as inductive invariants. System descriptions and certificates are generated and handled using the COQ proof assistant. Our tool framework is used to provide supporting evidence for the safety of embedded systems in the industrial automation domain to third-party authorities. In this document we describe the tool framework: usage scenarios, the archi-tecture, semantics of PLCs and their realization in COQ, proof generation and the construction of certificates.',

	{'abstract': u'One of the key challenges in sensor networks is the extraction of information by fusing data from a multitude of distinct, but possibly unreliable sensors. Recovering information from the maximum number of dependable sensors while specifying the unreliable ones is critical for robust sensing. This sensing task is formulated here as that of finding the maximum number of feasible subsystems of linear equations, and proved to be NP-hard. Useful links are established with compressive sampling, which aims at recovering vectors that are sparse. In contrast, the signals here are not sparse, but give rise to sparse residuals. Capitalizing on this form of sparsity, four sensing schemes with complementary strengths are developed. The first scheme is a convex relaxation of the original problem expressed as a second-order cone program (SOCP). It is shown that when the involved sensing matrices are Gaussian and the reliable measurements are sufficiently many, the SOCP can recover the optimal solution with overwhelming probability. The second scheme is obtained by replacing the initial objective function with a concave one. The third and fourth schemes are tailored for noisy sensor data. The noisy case is cast as a combinatorial problem that is subsequently surrogated by a (weighted) SOCP. Interestingly, the derived cost functions fall into the framework of robust multivariate linear regression, while an efficient block-coordinate descent algorithm is developed for their minimization. The robust sensing capabilities of all schemes are verified by simulated tests.',

When the finite field size is larger than or equal to the number of users, it is shown that we can always find an encoding vector which is both innovative and sparse. The sparsity can be utilized in speeding up the decoding process. An efficient algorithm to generate innovative and sparse encoding vectors is developed. Simulations show that the delay performance of our scheme with binary finite field outperforms a number of existing schemes in terms of average and worst-case delay.',

	{'abstract': u'We consider rate R = k/n causal linear codes that map a sequence of k-dimensional binary vectors to a sequence of n-dimensional binary vectors , such that each c_t is a function of . Such a code is called anytime reliable, for a particular binary-input memoryless channel, if at each time, probability of making an error about a source bit that was sent d time instants ago decays exponentially in d. Anytime reliable codes are useful in interactive communication problems and, in particular, can be used to stabilize unstable plants across noisy channels. Schulman proved the existence of such codes which, due to their structure, he called tree codes; however, to date, no explicit constructions and tractable decoding algorithms have been devised. In this paper, we show the existence of anytime reliable "linear" codes with "high probability", i.e., suitably chosen random linear causal codes are anytime reliable with high probability. The key is to consider time-invariant codes (i.e., ones with Toeplitz generator and parity check matrices) which obviates the need to union bound over all times. For the binary erasure channel we give a simple ML decoding algorithm whose average complexity is constant per time iteration and for which the probability that complexity at a given time t exceeds KC^3 decays exponentially in C. We show the efficacy of the method by simulating the stabilization of an unstable plant across a BEC, and remark on the tradeoffs between the utilization of the communication resources and the control performance.',

We numerically examine genetic algorithms (GAs) to determine the optimal set of parameters such as the weights for three essential interactions in BOIDS by Reynolds (1987) under `zero-collision' and `no-breaking-up' constraints. As a fitness function (the energy function) to be maximized by the GA, we choose the so-called the -value of anisotropy which can be observed empirically in typical flocks of starling. We confirm that the GA successfully finds the solution having a large -value leading-up to a strong anisotropy. The numerical experience shows that the procedure might enable us to make more realistic and efficient artificial flocking of starling even in our personal computers. We also evaluate two distinct types of interactions in agents, namely, metric and topological definitions of interactions. We confirmed that the topological definition can explain the empirical evidence much better than the metric definition does.",

	{'abstract': u'In this work, we investigate a model of an adaptive networked dynamical system, where the coupling strengths among phase oscillators coevolve with the phase states. It is shown that in this model the oscillators can spontaneously differentiate into two dynamical groups after a long time evolution. Within each group, the oscillators have similar phases, while oscillators in different groups have approximately opposite phases. The network gradually converts from the initial random structure with a uniform distribution of connection strengths into a modular structure which is characterized by strong intra connections and weak inter connections. Furthermore, the connection strengths follow a power law distribution, which is a natural consequence of the coevolution of the network and the dynamics. Interestingly, it is found that if the inter connections are weaker than a certain threshold, the two dynamical groups will almost decouple and evolve independently. These results are helpful in further understanding the empirical observations in many social and biological networks.',

	{'abstract': u"We study the problem of multiple hypothesis testing (HT) in view of a rejection option. That model of HT has many different applications. Errors in testing of M hypotheses regarding the source distribution with an option of rejecting all those hypotheses are considered. The source is discrete and arbitrarily varying (AVS). The tradeoffs among error probability exponents/reliabilities associated with false acceptance of rejection decision and false rejection of true distribution are investigated and the optimal decision strategies are outlined. The main result is specialized for discrete memoryless sources (DMS) and studied further. An interesting insight that the analysis implies is the phenomenon (comprehensible in terms of supervised/unsupervised learning) that in optimal discrimination within M hypothetical distributions one permits always lower error than in deciding to decline the set of hypotheses. Geometric interpretations of the optimal decision schemes are given for the current and known bounds in multi-HT for AVS's.",

	{'abstract': u'In the present paper, a modification of the Index-less Indexed Flash Codes (ILIFC) for flash memory storage system is presented. Although the ILIFC proposed by Mahdavifar et al. has excellent worst case performance, the ILIFC can be further improved in terms of the average case performance. The proposed scheme, referred to as the , is based on the ILIFC. However, the primary focus of the present study is the average case performance. The main feature of the proposed scheme is the use of the layer-based index coding to represent indices of information bits. The layer index coding promotes the uniform use of cell levels, which leads to better average case performance. Based on experiments, the proposed scheme achieves a larger average number of rewritings than the original ILIFC without loss of worst case performance.',

	{'abstract': u"Intra-session network coding is known to be vulnerable to pollution attacks. In this work, first, we introduce a novel homomorphic MAC scheme called SpaceMac, which allows an intermediate node to verify if its received packets belong to a specific subspace, even if the subspace is expanding over time. Then, we use SpaceMac as a building block to design a cooperative scheme that provides complete defense against pollution attacks: (i) it can detect polluted packets early at intermediate nodes and (ii) it can identify the exact location of all, even colluding, attackers, thus making it possible to eliminate them. Our scheme is cooperative: parents and children of any node cooperate to detect any corrupted packets sent by the node, and nodes in the network cooperate with a central controller to identify the exact location of all attackers. We implement SpaceMac in both C/C++ and Java as a library, and we make the library available online. Our evaluation on both a PC and an Android device shows that (i) SpaceMac's algorithms can be computed quickly and efficiently, and (ii) our cooperative defense scheme has low computation and significantly lower communication overhead than other comparable state-of-the-art schemes.",

	{'abstract': u'We deterministically crack the secure, statistical key exchange protocol based on feedback proposed by Pao-Lo Liu [ J. Lightwave Techology 27 (2009) pp. 5230-34]. The crack is ultimate and absolute because it works under idealized conditions, and produces much higher data visibility for the eavesdropper than the protocol provides for Alice and Bob. Even with the most idealistic driving noise spectrum stated by Liu, during the most secure phase of the protocol, far away from the transients, where the system is already in its most secure steady-state, the eavesdropper has 100% success rate in identifying the key bits, at the same time when Alice and Bob have less than 100% success rate while using the Liu protocol. No statistics is needed, Eve can extract the secure bit from two samples of the signal in the two direction. Thus the Liu-protocol offers no security against the attack described in this paper.',

	{'abstract': u'Hairpin completion and its variant called bounded hairpin completion are operations on formal languages, inspired by a hairpin formation in molecular biology. Another variant called hairpin lengthening has been recently introduced and studied on the closure properties and algorithmic problems concerning several families of languages. In this paper, we introduce a new operation of this kind, called hairpin incompletion which is not only an extension of bounded hairpin completion, but also a restricted (bounded) variant of hairpin lengthening. Further, the hairpin incompletion operation provides a formal language theoretic framework that models a bio-molecular technique nowadays known as Whiplash PCR. We study the closure properties of language families under both the operation and its iterated version. We show that a family of languages closed under intersection with regular sets, concatenation with regular sets, and finite union is closed under one-sided iterated hairpin incompletion, and that a family of languages containing all linear languages and closed under circular permutation, left derivative and substitution is also closed under iterated hairpin incompletion.',

	{'abstract': u'A simple four node network in which cooperation improves the information-theoretic secrecy is studied. The channel consists of two senders, a receiver, and an eavesdropper. One or both senders transmit confidential messages to the receiver, while the eavesdropper tries to decode the transmitted message. The main result is the derivation of a newly achievable rate-equivocation region that is shown to be larger than a rate-equivocation region derived by Lai and El Gamal for the relay-eavesdropper channel. When the rate of the helping interferer is zero, the new rate-equivocation region reduces to the capacity-equivocation region over the wire-tap channel, hence, the new achievability scheme can be seen as a generalization of a coding scheme proposed by Csiszar and Korner. This result can naturally be combined with a rate-equivocation region given by Tang et al. (for the interference assisted secret communication), yielding an even larger achievable rate-equivocation region.',

The use of the Unified Modeling Language (UML) as a model description language is also rapidly becoming a standard. All these concepts have relations to the HLA, but they are not part of it. There seems to be the danger that HLA is overrun by respective developments of the free market and will become irrelevant finally. ...

	{'abstract': u'In order to group the functional requirements for support to operations by modern information systems systematically, the NATO Code of best Practise (COBP) for C2 Assessment defines three domain areas: Battlespace Visualization, Decision Making, and Battle Management Functions. In addition, within an domain overlapping information grid of the information system, necessary functions for assessing and disseminating the information are capsulated. For all three domains, including the overlapping information grid, the respective requirements for functional support have to be met be future command, control, communications, and intelligence (C3I) systems. The paper describes the functional categories of the three domains having been defined for article 5 operations, extends them to meet the requirements for operations other than war (OOTW), and gives some examples how modules of simulation systems can deliver respective support functions. In addition, references defining migration procedures for legacy systems to enable a smooth change from the old to the new C3I paradigm are given.',

	{'abstract': u'This paper introduces a new method for learning and inferring sparse representations of depth (disparity) maps. The proposed algorithm relaxes the usual assumption of the stationary noise model in sparse coding. This enables learning from data corrupted with spatially varying noise or uncertainty, typically obtained by laser range scanners or structured light depth cameras. Sparse representations are learned from the Middlebury database disparity maps and then exploited in a two-layer graphical model for inferring depth from stereo, by including a sparsity prior on the learned features. Since they capture higher-order dependencies in the depth structure, these priors can complement smoothness priors commonly used in depth inference based on Markov Random Field (MRF) models. Inference on the proposed graph is achieved using an alternating iterative optimization technique, where the first layer is solved using an existing MRF-based stereo matching algorithm, then held fixed as the second layer is solved using the proposed non-stationary sparse coding algorithm. This leads to a general method for improving solutions of state of the art MRF-based depth estimation algorithms. Our experimental results first show that depth inference using learned representations leads to state of the art denoising of depth maps obtained from laser range scanners and a time of flight camera. Furthermore, we show that adding sparse priors improves the results of two depth estimation methods: the classical graph cut algorithm by Boykov et al. and the more recent algorithm of Woodford et al.',

	{'abstract': u'In distributed storage systems built using commodity hardware, it is necessary to have data redundancy in order to ensure system reliability. In such systems, it is also often desirable to be able to quickly repair storage nodes that fail. We consider a scheme--introduced by El Rouayheb and Ramchandran--which uses combinatorial block design in order to design storage systems that enable efficient (and exact) node repair. In this work, we investigate systems where node sizes may be much larger than replication degrees, and explicitly provide algorithms for constructing these storage designs. Our designs, which are related to projective geometries, are based on the construction of bipartite cage graphs (with girth 6) and the concept of mutually-orthogonal Latin squares. Via these constructions, we can guarantee that the resulting designs require the fewest number of storage nodes for the given parameters, and can further show that these systems can be easily expanded without need for frequent reconfiguration.',

	{'abstract': u'It has been recently shown by Lapidoth and Steinberg that strictly causal state information can be beneficial in multiple access channels (MACs). Specifically, it was proved that the capacity region of a two-user MAC with independent states, each known strictly causally to one encoder, can be enlarged by letting the encoders send compressed past state information to the decoder. In this work, a generalization of the said strategy is proposed whereby the encoders compress also the past transmitted codewords along with the past state sequences. The proposed scheme uses a combination of long-message encoding, compression of the past state sequences and codewords without binning, and joint decoding over all transmission blocks. The proposed strategy has been recently shown by Lapidoth and Steinberg to strictly improve upon the original one. Capacity results are then derived for a class of channels that include two-user modulo-additive state-dependent MACs. Moreover, the proposed scheme is extended to state-dependent MACs with an arbitrary number of users. Finally, output feedback is introduced and an example is provided to illustrate the interplay between feedback and availability of strictly causal state information in enlarging the capacity region.',

	{'abstract': u'Aggregation is an important building block of modern distributed applications, allowing the determination of meaningful properties (e.g. network size, total storage capacity, average load, majorities, etc.) that are used to direct the execution of the system. However, the majority of the existing aggregation algorithms exhibit relevant dependability issues, when prospecting their use in real application environments. In this paper, we reveal some dependability issues of aggregation algorithms based on iterative averaging techniques, giving some directions to solve them. This class of algorithms is considered robust (when compared to common tree-based approaches), being independent from the used routing topology and providing an aggregation result at all nodes. However, their robustness is strongly challenged and their correctness often compromised, when changing the assumptions of their working environment to more realistic ones. The correctness of this class of algorithms relies on the maintenance of a fundamental invariant, commonly designated as "mass conservation". We will argue that this main invariant is often broken in practical settings, and that additional mechanisms and modifications are required to maintain it, incurring in some degradation of the algorithms performance. In particular, we discuss the behavior of three representative algorithms Push-Sum Protocol, Push-Pull Gossip protocol and Distributed Random Grouping under asynchronous and faulty (with message loss and node crashes) environments. More specifically, we propose and evaluate two new versions of the Push-Pull Gossip protocol, which solve its message interleaving problem (evidenced even in a synchronous operation mode).',

	{'abstract': u'Evolutionary dynamics have been traditionally studied in the context of homogeneous populations, mainly described my the Moran process. Recently, this approach has been generalized in cite by arranging individuals on the nodes of a network. Undirected networks seem to have a smoother behavior than directed ones, and thus it is more challenging to find suppressors/amplifiers of selection. In this paper we present the first class of undirected graphs which act as suppressors of selection, by achieving a fixation probability that is at most one half of that of the complete graph, as the number of vertices increases. Moreover, we provide some generic upper and lower bounds for the fixation probability of general undirected graphs. As our main contribution, we introduce the natural alternative of the model proposed in cite, where all individuals interact simultaneously and the result is a compromise between aggressive and non-aggressive individuals. That is, the behavior of the individuals in our new model and in the model of cite can be interpreted as an "aggregation" vs. an "all-or-nothing" strategy, respectively. We prove that our new model of mutual influences admits a emph, which guarantees the convergence of the system for any graph topology and any initial fitness vector of the individuals. Furthermore, we prove fast convergence to the stable state for the case of the complete graph, as well as we provide almost tight bounds on the limit fitness of the individuals. Apart from being important on its own, this new evolutionary model appears to be useful also in the abstract modeling of control mechanisms over invading populations in networks. We demonstrate this by introducing and analyzing two alternative control approaches, for which we bound the time needed to stabilize to the "healthy" state of the system.',

This paper studies how the flexibility offered by network virtualization can be used to improve Quality-of-Service parameters such as latency, while taking into account allocation costs. A generic use case is considered where both the overall demand issued for a certain service (for example, an SAP application in the cloud, or a gaming application) as well as the origins of the requests change over time (e.g., due to time zone effects or due to user mobility), and we present online and optimal offline strategies to compute the number and location of the servers implementing this service. These algorithms also allow us to study the fundamental benefits of dynamic resource allocation compared to static systems. Our simulation results confirm our expectations that the gain of flexible server allocation is particularly high in scenarios with moderate dynamics.',

	{'abstract': u'We introduce a new compile-time notion of type subsumption based on type simulation. We show how to apply this static subsumption relation to support a more intuitive, object oriented approach to generic programming of reusable, high performance container types. As a first step towards an efficient implementation of the resulting type system in a compiler we present a novel algorithm for bidirectional type inference over arbitrary syntax graphs. The algorithm uses the new static type subsumption relation to compress the data that has to be stored for each node in the typeflow graph. During typeflow analysis this means that the set of types for a given node can be symbolically represented using antichains instead of using bitvectors or some other explicit set representation. This results in a typing algorithm that is both flexible and precise and shows good performance on representative instances.',

	{'abstract': u'This paper investigates the capacity problem for some multiple-access scenarios with cooperative transmitters. First, a general Multiple-Access Channel (MAC) with common information, i.e., a scenario where p transmitters send private messages and also a common message to q receivers and each receiver decodes all of the messages, is considered. The capacity region of the discrete memoryless channel is characterized. Then, the general Gaussian fading MAC with common information wherein partial Channel State Information (CSI) is available at the transmitters (CSIT) and perfect CSI is available at the receivers (CSIR) is investigated. A coding theorem is proved for this model that yields an exact characterization of the throughput capacity region. Finally, a two-transmitter/one-receiver Gaussian fading MAC with conferencing encoders with partial CSIT and perfect CSIR is studied and its capacity region is determined. For the Gaussian fading models with CSIR only (transmitters have no access to CSIT), some numerical examples and simulation results are provided for Rayleigh fading.',

Constructed algorithm is a mix of ideas of two algorithms: Klinz &amp; Woeginger partitioning algorithm and Mann &amp; Shapley generating functions algorithm. Time and space complexities of the algorithm are analysed and compared with other known algorithms for the problem. Constructed algorithm has pessimistic time complexity O(n 2^(n/2))and pseudopolynomial complexity O(nq), where q is quota of the voting game. This paper also solves open problem stated by H. Aziz and M. Paterson - existence of the algorithm for calculating Banzhaf power indices of all players with time complexity lower than O(n^2 2^(n/2)). Not only is the answer positive but this can be done keeping the pseudopolynomial complexity of generating functions algorithm in case weights are integers. New open problems are stated.',

	{'abstract': u'In this paper we consider the problem of monitoring detecting separation of agents from a base station in robotic and sensor networks. Such separation can be caused by mobility and/or failure of the agents. While separation/cut detection may be performed by passing messages between a node and the base in static networks, such a solution is impractical for networks with high mobility, since routes are constantly changing. We propose a distributed algorithm to detect separation from the base station. The algorithm consists of an averaging scheme in which every node updates a scalar state by communicating with its current neighbors. We prove that if a node is permanently disconnected from the base station, its state converges to . If a node is connected to the base station in an average sense, even if not connected in any instant, then we show that the expected value of its state converges to a positive number. Therefore, a node can detect if it has been separated from the base station by monitoring its state. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated through simulations, a real system implementation and experiments involving both static as well as mobile networks.',

	{'abstract': u'An admission control scheme should play the role of a coordinator for flows in a data communication network, to provide the guarantees as the medium is shared. The nodes of a wired network can monitor the medium to know the available bandwidth at any point of time. But, in wireless ad hoc networks, a node must consume the bandwidth of neighboring nodes, during a communication. Hence, the consumption of bandwidth by a flow and the availability of resources to any wireless node strictly depend upon the neighboring nodes within its transmission range. We present a scalable and efficient admission control scheme, Multi-hop Bandwidth Management Protocol (MBMP), to support the QoS requirements in multi-hop ad hoc networks. We simulate several options to design MBMP and compare the performances of these options through mathematical analysis and simulation results, and compare its effectiveness with the existing admission control schemes through extensive simulations.',

	{'abstract': u'We study frequency allocation in wireless networks. A wireless network is modeled by an undirected graph, with vertices corresponding to cells. In each vertex we have a certain number of requests, and each of those requests must be assigned a different frequency. Edges represent conflicts between cells, meaning that frequencies in adjacent vertices must be different as well. The objective is to minimize the total number of used frequencies. The offline version of the problem is known to be NP-hard. In the incremental version, requests for frequencies arrive over time and the algorithm is required to assign a frequency to a request as soon as it arrives. Competitive incremental algorithms have been studied for several classes of graphs. For paths, the optimal (asymptotic) ratio is known to be 4/3, while for hexagonal-cell graphs it is between 1.5 and 1.9126. For k-colorable graphs, the ratio of (k+1)/2 can be achieved. In this paper, we prove nearly tight bounds on the asymptotic competitive ratio for bipartite graphs, showing that it is between 1.428 and 1.433. This improves the previous lower bound of 4/3 and upper bound of 1.5. Our proofs are based on reducing the incremental problem to a purely combinatorial (equivalent) problem of constructing set families with certain intersection properties.',

An improved zero decomposition algorithm which can be used to reduce the zero set of an equation system in general form to the union of zero sets of monic proper triangular sets is proposed. As a consequence, we can give an explicit formula for the number of solutions of an equation system. Bitsize complexity for the algorithm is given in the case of Boolean polynomials. We also give a multiplication free characteristic set method for Boolean polynomials, where the sizes of the polynomials are effectively controlled. The algorithms are implemented in the case of Boolean polynomials and extensive experiments show that they are quite efficient for solving certain classes of Boolean equations.',

We use the symmetric alpha stable noise distribution and adopt two models which assume dependent and independent noise components across receive antennas. We derive pairwise error probability (PEP) of orthogonal space-time block codes (STBC) with a benchmark genie-aided receiver (GAR), or the minimum distance receiver (MDR) which is optimal in the Gaussian case. For general space-time codes we propose a maximum-likelihood (ML) receiver, and its approximation at high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The resulting asymptotically optimal receiver (AOR) does not depend on noise parameters and is computationally simple. Monte-Carlo simulations are used to supplement our analytical results and compare the performance of the receivers.',

However, the earliest LP decoders proposed for binary and nonbinary LDPC codes are not suitable for use at moderate and large code lengths. To overcome this problem, Vontobel et al. developed an iterative Low-Complexity LP (LCLP) decoding algorithm for binary LDPC codes. The variable and check node calculations of binary LCLP decoding algorithm are related to those of binary Belief Propagation (BP). The present authors generalized this work to derive an iterative LCLP decoding algorithm for nonbinary linear codes. Contrary to binary LCLP, the variable and check node calculations of this algorithm are in general different from that of nonbinary BP. The overall complexity of nonbinary LCLP decoding is linear in block length; however the complexity of its check node calculations is exponential in the check node degree. In this paper, we propose a modified BCJR algorithm for efficient check node processing in the nonbinary LCLP decoding algorithm. The proposed algorithm has complexity linear in the check node degree. We also introduce an alternative state metric to improve the run time of the proposed algorithm. Simulation results are presented for and nonbinary LDPC codes over .',

	{'abstract': u'It is important to enable reasoning about the meaning and possible effects of updates to ensure that the updated system operates correctly. A formal, mathematical model of dynamic update should be developed, in order to understand by both users and implementors of update technology what design choices can be considered. In this paper, we define a formal calculus , a variant extension of higher-order calculus, to model dynamic updates of component-based software, which is language and technology independent. The calculus focuses on following main concepts: proper granularity of update, timing of dynamic update, state transformation between versions, update failure check and recovery. We describe a series of rule on safe component updates to model some general processes of dynamic update and discuss its reduction semantics coincides with a labelled transition system semantics that illustrate the expressive power of these calculi.',

	{'abstract': u"We consider the problem of identifying a team of skilled individuals for collaboration, in the presence of a social network. Each node in the social network may be an expert in one or more skills. Edge weights specify affinity or collaborative compatibility between respective nodes. Given a project that requires a set of specified number of skilled individuals in each area of expertise, the goal is to identify a team that maximizes the collaborative compatibility. For example, the requirement may be to form a team that has at least three databases experts and at least two theory experts. We explore team formation where the collaborative compatibility objective is measured as the density of the induced subgraph on selected nodes. The problem of maximizing density is NP-hard even when the team requires individuals of only one skill. We present a 3-approximation algorithm that improves upon a naive extension of the previously known algorithm for densest at least subgraph problem. We further show how the same approximation can be extended to a special case of multiple skills. Our problem generalizes the formulation studied by Lappas et al. [KDD '09] who measure team compatibility in terms of diameter or spanning tree costs. Experiments are performed on a crawl of the DBLP graph where individuals can be skilled in at most four areas - theory, databases, data mining, and artificial intelligence. In addition to our main algorithm, we also present heuristic extensions to trade off between the size of the solution and its induced density. These density-based algorithms outperform the diameter-based objective on several metrics for assessing the collaborative compatibility of teams. The solutions suggested are also intuitively meaningful and scale well with the increase in the number of skilled individuals required.",

	{'abstract': u'A set of linearly constrained permutation matrices are proposed for constructing a class of permutation codes. Making use of linear constraints imposed on the permutation matrices, we can formulate a minimum Euclidian distance decoding problem for the proposed class of permutation codes as a linear programming (LP) problem. The main feature of this class of permutation codes, called LP decodable permutation codes, is this LP decodability. It is demonstrated that the LP decoding performance of the proposed class of permutation codes is characterized by the vertices of the code polytope of the code. Two types of linear constraints are discussed; one is structured constraints and another is random constraints. The structured constraints such as pure involution lead to an efficient encoding algorithm. On the other hand, the random constraints enable us to use probabilistic methods for analyzing several code properties such as the average cardinality and the average weight distribution.',

Therefore undertaking a user experience (UX) study is crucial to ensure that a game achieves both critical and financial success. However, traditional usability methods (observation, subjective reporting, questionnaire, and interview) have a number of limitations on game user research. In this study we capture player's physiological measures during a gameplay session, to indicate micro-events that have caused changes in their body signals. At the post-gameplay interviews we ask participants to comment and describe their feelings on the selected events. The aim of this study is not to over-interpret physiological measures, but on using blips in measures to help identify key points in a game, which we then use to investigate further with the participant. This approach provides a method that can identify not only the negative user experience and usability issues but also the events which have a positive impact on player's experience.",

	{'abstract': u'A well-known result by Palamidessi tells us that pimix (the pi-calculus with mixed choice) is more expressive than pisep (its subset with only separate choice). The proof of this result argues with their different expressive power concerning leader election in symmetric networks. Later on, Gorla offered an arguably simpler proof that, instead of leader election in symmetric networks, employed the reducibility of incestual processes (mixed choices that include both enabled senders and receivers for the same channel) when running two copies in parallel. In both proofs, the role of breaking (initial) symmetries is more or less apparent. In this paper, we shed more light on this role by re-proving the above result - based on a proper formalization of what it means to break symmetries without referring to another layer of the distinguishing problem domain of leader election. Both Palamidessi and Gorla rephrased their results by stating that there is no uniform and reasonable encoding from pimix into pisep. We indicate how the respective proofs can be adapted and exhibit the consequences of varying notions of uniformity and reasonableness. In each case, the ability to break initial symmetries turns out to be essential.',

	{'abstract': u'This paper introduces a new theory of multiparty session types based on symmetric sum types, by which we can type non-deterministic orchestration choice behaviours. While the original branching type in session types can represent a choice made by a single participant and accepted by others determining how the session proceeds, the symmetric sum type represents a choice made by agreement among all the participants of a session. Such behaviour can be found in many practical systems, including collaborative workflow in healthcare systems for clinical practice guidelines (CPGs). Processes using the symmetric sums can be embedded into the original branching types using conductor processes. We show that this type-driven embedding preserves typability, satisfies semantic soundness and completeness, and meets the encodability criteria adapted to the typed setting. The theory leads to an efficient implementation of a prototypical tool for CPGs which automatically translates the original CPG specifications from a representation called the Process Matrix to symmetric sum types, type checks programs and executes them.',

	{'abstract': u'Multiple Input Double Output (MIDO) asymmetric space-time codes for 4 transmit antennas and 2 receive antennas can be employed in the downlink from base stations to portable devices. Previous MIDO code constructions with low Maximum Likelihood (ML) decoding complexity, full diversity and the non-vanishing determinant (NVD) property are mostly based on cyclic division algebras. In this paper, a new family of MIDO codes with the NVD property based on crossed-product algebras over Q is introduced. Fast decodability follows naturally from the structure of the codewords which consist of four generalized Alamouti blocks. The associated ML complexity order is the lowest known for full-rate MIDO codes (O(M^) instead of O(M^) with respect to the real constellation size M). Numerical simulations show that these codes have a performance from comparable up to 1dB gain compared to the best known MIDO code with the same complexity.',

	{'abstract': u'Sound behavioral equations on open terms may become unsound after conservative extensions of the underlying operational semantics. Providing criteria under which such equations are preserved is extremely useful; in particular, it can avoid the need to repeat proofs when extending the specified language. This paper investigates preservation of sound equations for several notions of bisimilarity on open terms: closed-instance (ci-)bisimilarity and formal-hypothesis (fh-)bisimilarity, both due to Robert de Simone, and hypothesis-preserving (hp-)bisimilarity, due to Arend Rensink. For both fh-bisimilarity and hp-bisimilarity, we prove that arbitrary sound equations on open terms are preserved by all disjoint extensions which do not add labels. We also define slight variations of fh- and hp-bisimilarity such that all sound equations are preserved by arbitrary disjoint extensions. Finally, we give two sets of syntactic criteria (on equations, resp. operational extensions) and prove each of them to be sufficient for preserving ci-bisimilarity.',

Multi-CCS is equipped with a labeled transition system semantics, which makes use of a minimal structural congruence.

This is the first rich process calculus, including CCS as a subcalculus, which receives a semantics in terms of unsafe, labeled P/T nets.

	{'abstract': u'Multiple measurement vector (MMV) problem addresses the identification of unknown input vectors that share common sparse support. The MMV problems had been traditionally addressed either by sensor array signal processing or compressive sensing. However, recent breakthrough in this area such as compressive MUSIC (CS-MUSIC) or subspace-augumented MUSIC (SA-MUSIC) optimally combines the compressive sensing (CS) and array signal processing such that supports are first found by CS and the remaining supports are determined by generalized MUSIC criterion, where and denote the sparsity and the independent snapshots, respectively. Even though such hybrid approach significantly outperforms the conventional algorithms, its performance heavily depends on the correct identification of partial support by compressive sensing step, which often deteriorate the overall performance. The main contribution of this paper is, therefore, to show that as long as correct supports are included in any -sparse CS solution, the optimal partial support can be found using a subspace fitting criterion, significantly improving the overall performance of CS-MUSIC. Furthermore, unlike the single measurement CS counterpart that requires infinite SNR for a perfect support recovery, we can derive an information theoretic sufficient condition for the perfect recovery using CS-MUSIC under a SNR scenario.',

	{'abstract': u'Timed automata and register automata are well-known models of computation over timed and data words respectively. The former has clocks that allow to test the lapse of time between two events, whilst the latter includes registers that can store data values for later comparison. Although these two models behave in appearance differently, several decision problems have the same (un)decidability and complexity results for both models. As a prominent example, emptiness is decidable for alternating automata with one clock or register, both with non-primitive recursive complexity. This is not by chance. This work confirms that there is indeed a tight relationship between the two models. We show that a run of a timed automaton can be simulated by a register automaton, and conversely that a run of a register automaton can be simulated by a timed automaton. Our results allow to transfer complexity and decidability results back and forth between these two kinds of models. We justify the usefulness of these reductions by obtaining new results on register automata.',

	{'abstract': u'We introduce a new criterion, replacement freeness, to discern the relative expressiveness of process calculi. Intuitively, a calculus is strongly replacement free if replacing, within an enclosing context, a process that cannot perform any visible action by an arbitrary process never inhibits the capability of the resulting process to perform a visible action. We prove that there exists no compositional and interaction sensitive encoding of a not strongly replacement free calculus into any strongly replacement free one. We then define a weaker version of replacement freeness, by only considering replacement of closed processes, and prove that, if we additionally require the encoding to preserve name independence, it is not even possible to encode a non replacement free calculus into a weakly replacement free one. As a consequence of our encodability results, we get that many calculi equipped with priority are not replacement free and hence are not encodable into mainstream calculi like CCS and pi-calculus, that instead are strongly replacement free. We also prove that variants of pi-calculus with match among names, pattern matching or polyadic synchronization are only weakly replacement free, hence they are separated both from process calculi with priority and from mainstream calculi.',

	{'abstract': u'We introduce a model of the Relentless Congestion Control proposed by Matt Mathis. Relentless Congestion Control (RCC) is a modification of the AIMD (Additive Increase Multiplicative Decrease) congestion control which consists in decreasing the TCP congestion window by the number of lost segments instead of halving it. Despite some on-going discussions at the ICCRG IRTF-group, this congestion control has, to the best of our knowledge, never been modeled. In this paper, we provide an analytical model of this novel congestion control and propose an implementation of RCC for the commonly-used network simulator ns-2. We also improve RCC with the addition of a loss retransmission detection scheme (based on SACK+) to prevent RTO caused by a loss of a retransmission and called this new version RCC+. The proposed models describe both the original RCC algorithm and RCC+ improvement and would allow to better assess the impact of this new congestion control scheme over the network traffic.',

	{'abstract': u"The languages accepted by finite automata are precisely the languages denoted by regular expressions. In contrast, finite automata may exhibit behaviours that cannot be described by regular expressions up to bisimilarity. In this paper, we consider extensions of the theory of regular expressions with various forms of parallel composition and study the effect on expressiveness. First we prove that adding pure interleaving to the theory of regular expressions strictly increases its expressiveness up to bisimilarity. Then, we prove that replacing the operation for pure interleaving by ACP-style parallel composition gives a further increase in expressiveness. Finally, we prove that the theory of regular expressions with ACP-style parallel composition and encapsulation is expressive enough to express all finite automata up to bisimilarity. Our results extend the expressiveness results obtained by Bergstra, Bethke and Ponse for process algebras with (the binary variant of) Kleene's star operation.",

Most known constructions of linear embeddings that satisfy the Johnson-Lindenstrauss property involve randomness. We address the question of explicitly constructing such embedding families and provide a construction with an almost optimal use of randomness: we use O(log(n/delta)log(log(n/delta)/epsilon)) random bits for embedding n dimensions to O(log(1/delta)/epsilon^2) dimensions with error probability at most delta, and distortion at most epsilon. In particular, for delta = 1/poly(n) and fixed epsilon, we use O(log n loglog n) random bits. Previous constructions required at least O(log^2 n) random bits to get polynomially small error.',

	{'abstract': u'We show that the dominating set problem parameterized by solution size is fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) in graphs that do not contain the claw (K(1,3)), the complete bipartite graph on four vertices where the two parts have one and three vertices, respectively) as an induced subgraph. We present an algorithm that uses 2^O(k^2)n^O(1) time and polynomial space to decide whether a claw-free graph on n vertices has a dominating set of size at most k. Note that this parameterization of dominating set is W[2]-hard on the set of all graphs, and thus is unlikely to have an FPT algorithm for graphs in general. The most general class of graphs for which an FPT algorithm was previously known for this parameterization of dominating set is the class of K(i,j)-free graphs, which exclude, for some fixed i,j, the complete bipartite graph K(i,j) as a subgraph. For i,i &gt;= 2, the class of claw-free graphs and any class of K(i,j)-free graphs are not comparable with respect to set inclusion. We thus extend the range of graphs over which this parameterization of dominating set is known to be fixed-parameter tractable. We also show that, in some sense, it is the presence of the claw that makes this parameterization of the dominating set problem hard. More precisely, we show that for any t ?&gt;= 4, the dominating set problem parameterized by the solution size is W[2]-hard in graphs that exclude the t-claw K(1,t) as an induced subgraph. Our arguments also imply that the related connected dominating set and dominating clique problems are W[2]-hard in these graph classes. Finally, we show that for any t, the clique problem parameterized by solution size, which is W[1]-hard on general graphs, is FPT in t-claw-free graphs. Our results add to the small and growing collection of FPT results for graph classes defined by excluded subgraphs, rather than by excluded minors.',

	{'abstract': u'Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) became one of the high technology domains during the last ten years. Real-time applications for them make it necessary to provide the guaranteed Quality of Service (QoS). The main contributions of this paper are a system skeleton and a guaranteed QoS model that are suitable for the WSNs. To do it, we develop a sensor node model based on virtual buffer sharing and present a two-layer scheduling model using the network calculus. With the system skeleton, we develop a guaranteed QoS model, such as the upper bounds on buffer queue length/delay/effective bandwidth, and single-hop/ multi-hops delay/jitter/effective bandwidth. Numerical results show the system skeleton and the guaranteed QoS model are scalable for different types of flows, including the self-similar traffic flows, and the parameters of flow regulators and service curves of sensor nodes affect them. Our proposal leads to buffer dimensioning, guaranteed QoS support and control in the WSNs.',

	{'abstract': u'Power line as an alternative for data transmission is being explored, and also being used to a certain extent. But from the data transfer point of view, power line, as a channel is highly dynamic and hence not quite suitable. To convert the office or home wiring system to a Local Area Network (LAN), adaptive changes are to be made to the existing protocols. In this paper, a slotted transmission scheme is suggested, in which usable timeslots are found out by physically sensing the media. Common usable timeslots for the sender-receiver pair are used for communication. But these will not ensure safe packet delivery since packets may be corrupted on the way during propagation from sender to receiver. Therefore, we also suggest a proximity based retransmission scheme where each machine in the LAN, buffers good packet and machines close to the receiver retransmit on receiving a NACK.',

	{'abstract': u'The interference channel with a cognitive relay consists of a classical interference channel with two sourcedestination pairs and with an additional cognitive relay that has a priori knowledge of the sources\' messages and aids in the sources\' transmission. We derive a new outer bound for this channel using an argument originally devised for the "more capable" broadcast channel, and show the achievability of the proposed outer bound in the "very strong interference" regime, a class of channels where there is no loss in optimality if both destinations decode both messages. This result is analogous to the "very strong interference" capacity result for the classical interference channel and for the cognitive interference channel, and is the first capacity known capacity result for the general interference channel with a cognitive relay.',

	{'abstract': u'This work proposes a novel outer bound for the Gaussian cognitive interference channel in strong interference at the primary receiver based on the capacity of a multi-antenna broadcast channel with degraded message set. It then shows that for the Z-channel, i.e., when the secondary receiver experiences no interference and the primary receiver experiences strong interference, the proposed outer bound not only is the tightest among known bounds but is actually achievable for sufficiently strong interference. The latter is a novel capacity result that from numerical evaluations appears to be generalizable to a larger (i.e., non-Z) class of Gaussian channels.',

	{'abstract': u'The InterFerence Channel with a Cognitive Relay (IFC-CR) consists of a classical two-user interference channel in which the two independent messages are also non-causally known at a cognitive relay node. In this work a special class of IFC-CRs in which the sources do not create interference at the non-intended destinations is analyzed. This special model results in a channel with two non-interfering point-to-point channels whose transmission is aided by an in-band cognitive relay, which is thus referred to as the Parallel Channel with a Cognitive Relay (PC-CR). We determine the capacity of the PC-CR channel to within 3 bits/s/Hz for all channel parameters. In particular, we present several new outer bounds which we achieve to within a constant gap by proper selection of Gaussian input distributions in a simple rate-splitting and superposition coding-based inner bound. The inner and outer bounds are numerically evaluated to show that the actual gap can be far less than 3 bits/s/Hz.',

	{'abstract': u'The ideas of wireless network coding at the physical layer promise high throughput gains in wireless systems with relays and multi-way traffic flows. This gain can be ascribed to two principles: (1) joint transmission of multiple communication flows and (2) usage of emph information to cancel the interference. In this paper we use these principles to devise new transmission schemes in wireless cellular systems that feature both users served directly by the base stations (direct users) and users served through relays (relayed users). We present four different schemes for emph of uplink and downlink traffic in which one direct and one relayed user are served. These schemes are then used as building blocks in multi-user scenarios, where we present several schemes for scheduling pairs of users for coordinated transmissions. The optimal scheme involves exhaustive search of the best user pair in terms of overall rate. We propose several suboptimal scheduling schemes, which perform closely to the optimal scheme. The numerical results show a substantial increase in the system--level rate with respect to the systems with non--coordinated transmissions.',

	{'abstract': u"In this research, we study the optimization challenges of MANET and cross-layer technique to improve its performance. We propose an adaptive retransmission limits algorithm for IEEE 802.11 MAC to reduce the false link failures and predict the node mobility. We implemented cross layer interaction between physical and MAC layers. The MAC layer utilizes the physical layer information for differentiating false link failure from true link failure. The MAC layer adaptively selects a retransmission limit (short and long) based on the neighbour signal strength and sender node speed information from the physical layer. The proposed approach tracks the signal strength of each node in network and, while transmitting to a neighbour node, if it's received signal strength is high and is received recently then Adaptive MAC persists in its retransmission attempts. As there is high probability that neighbour node is still in transmission range and may be not responding due to some problems other then mobility. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of MANET and show that how our Adaptive MAC greatly improves it. The simulation is done using Network Simulator NS-2.",

	{'abstract': u'A code for communication over the k-receiver additive white Gaussian noise broadcast channel with feedback is presented and analyzed using tools from the theory of linear quadratic Gaussian optimal control. It is shown that the performance of this code depends on the noise correlation at the receivers and it is related to the solution of a discrete algebraic Riccati equation. For the case of independent noises, the sum rate achieved by the proposed code, satisfying average power constraint P, is characterized as 1/2 log (1+P*phi), where the coefficient "phi" in the interval [1,k] quantifies the power gain due to the presence of feedback. When specialized to the case of two receivers, this includes a previous result by Elia and strictly improves upon the code of Ozarow and Leung. When the noises are correlated, the pre-log of the sum-capacity of the broadcast channel with feedback can be strictly greater than one. It is established that for all noise covariance matrices of rank r the pre-log of the sum capacity is at most k-r+1 and, conversely, there exists a noise covariance matrix of rank r for which the proposed code achieves this upper bound. This generalizes a previous result by Gastpar and Wigger for the two-receiver broadcast channel.',

	{'abstract': u"Truthfulness is fragile and demanding. It is oftentimes computationally harder than solving the original problem. Even worse, truthfulness can be utterly destroyed by small uncertainties in a mechanism's outcome. One obstacle is that truthful payments depend on outcomes other than the one realized, such as the lengths of non-shortest-paths in a shortest-path auction. Single-call mechanisms are a powerful tool that circumvents this obstacle --- they implicitly charge truthful payments, guaranteeing truthfulness in expectation using only the outcome realized by the mechanism. The cost of such truthfulness is a trade-off between the expected quality of the outcome and the risk of large payments. We largely settle when and to what extent single-call mechanisms are possible. The first single-call construction was discovered by Babaioff, Kleinberg, and Slivkins [BKS10] in single-parameter domains. They give a transformation that turns any monotone, single-parameter allocation rule into a truthful-in-expectation single-call mechanism. Our first result is a natural complement to [BKS10]: we give a new transformation that produces a single-call VCG mechanism from any allocation rule for which VCG payments are truthful. Second, in both the single-parameter and VCG settings, we precisely characterize the possible transformations, showing that that a wide variety of transformations are possible but that all take a very simple form. Finally, we study the inherent trade-off between the expected quality of the outcome and the risk of large payments. We show that our construction and that of [BKS10] simultaneously optimize a variety of metrics in their respective domains. As an example, we analyze pay-per-click advertising auctions, where the truthfulness of the standard VCG-based auction is easily broken when the auctioneer's estimated click-through-rates are imprecise.",

	{'abstract': u'Random Linear Network Coding (RLNC) has emerged as a powerful tool for robust high-throughput multicast. Projection analysis - a recently introduced technique - shows that the distributed packetized RLNC protocol achieves (order) optimal and perfectly pipelined information dissemination in many settings. In the original approach to RNLC intermediate nodes code together all available information. This requires intermediate nodes to keep considerable data available for coding. Moreover, it results in a coding complexity that grows linearly with the size of this data. While this has been identified as a problem, approaches that combine queuing theory and network coding have heretofore not provided a succinct representation of the memory needs of network coding at intermediates nodes. This paper shows the surprising result that, in all settings with a continuous stream of data, network coding continues to perform optimally even if only one packet per node is kept in active memory and used for computations. This leads to an extremely simple RLNC protocol variant with drastically reduced requirements on computational and memory resources. By extending the projection analysis, we show that in all settings in which the RLNC protocol was proven to be optimal its finite memory variant performs equally well. In the same way as the original projection analysis, our technique applies in a wide variety of network models, including highly dynamic topologies that can change completely at any time in an adversarial fashion.',

	{'abstract': u"Push message delivery, where a client maintains an ``always-on'' connection with a server in order to be notified of a (asynchronous) message arrival in real-time, is increasingly being used in Internet services. The key message in this paper is that push message delivery on the World Wide Web is not scalable for servers, intermediate network elements, and battery-operated mobile device clients. We present a measurement analysis of a commercially deployed WWW push email service to highlight some of these issues. Next, we suggest content-based optimization to reduce the always-on connection requirement of push messaging. Our idea is based on exploiting the periodic nature of human-to-human messaging. We show how machine learning can accurately model the times of a day or week when messages are least likely to arrive; and turn off always-on connections these times. We apply our approach to a real email data set and our experiments demonstrate that the number of hours of active always-on connections can be cut by half while still achieving real-time message delivery for up to 90% of all messages.",

	{'abstract': u"We study the problem of selling a resource through an auction mechanism. The winning buyer in turn develops this resource to generate profit. Two forms of payment are considered: charging the winning buyer a one-time payment, or an initial payment plus a profit sharing contract (PSC). We consider a symmetric interdependent values model with risk averse or risk neutral buyers and a risk neutral seller. For the second price auction and the English auction, we show that the seller's expected total revenue from the auction where he also takes a fraction of the positive profit is higher than the expected revenue from the auction with only a one-time payment. Moreover, the seller can generate an even higher expected total revenue if, in addition to taking a fraction of the positive profit, he also takes the same fraction of any loss incurred from developing the resource. Moving beyond simple PSCs, we show that the auction with a PSC from a very general class generates higher expected total revenue than the auction with only a one-time payment. Finally, we show that suitable PSCs provide higher expected total revenue than a one-time payment even when the incentives of the winning buyer to develop the resource must be addressed by the seller.",

The nonlinear model describing the relative dynamics of the vehicles is interpreted as linear uncertain system, with the leader robot acting as an external disturbance. The VMP is then reformulated as a linear constrained regulation problem with additive disturbances (DLCRP). Positive D-invariance conditions for linear uncertain systems with parametric disturbance matrix are introduced and used to solve the VMP when box bounds on the state, control input and disturbance are considered. The proposed design procedure is shown to be easily adaptable to more general working scenarios.

	{'abstract': u'We face the following dilemma for designing low-density parity-check codes (LDPC) for quantum error correction. 1) The row weights of parity-check should be large: The minimum distances are bounded above by the minimum row weights of parity-check matrices of constituent classical codes. Small minimum distance tends to result in poor decoding performance at the error-floor region. 2) The row weights of parity-check matrices should not be large: The sum-product decoding performance at the water-fall region is degraded as the row weight increases. Recently, Kudekar et al. showed spatially-coupled (SC) LDPC codes exhibit capacity-achieving performance for classical channels. SC LDPC codes have both large row weight and capacity-achieving error-floor and water-fall performance. In this paper, we design SC LDPC-CSS (Calderbank, Shor and Steane) codes for quantum error correction over the depolarizing channels.',

Notably, interference alignment and sum-rate based algorithms such as the maximum signal-to-interference-plus noise (max-SINR) algorithm are considered. Optimal linear beamforming under interference alignment consists of two layers; an inner precoder and decoder (or receive filter) accomplish interference alignment to eliminate inter-user interference, and an outer precoder and decoder diagonalize the effective single-user channel resulting from the interference alignment by the inner precoder and decoder. The relationship between this two-layer beamforming and the max-SINR algorithm is established at high signal-to-noise ratio. Also, the optimality of the max-SINR algorithm within the class of linear beamforming algorithms, and its local convergence with exponential rate, are established at high signal-to-noise ratio.',

	{'abstract': u'Given a directed graph G and an integer k &gt;= 1, a k-transitive-closure-spanner (k-TCspanner) of G is a directed graph H that has (1) the same transitive-closure as G and (2) diameter at most k. In some applications, the shortcut paths added to the graph in order to obtain small diameter can use Steiner vertices, that is, vertices not in the original graph G. The resulting spanner is called a Steiner transitive-closure spanner (Steiner TC-spanner). Motivated by applications to property reconstruction and access control hierarchies, we concentrate on Steiner TC-spanners of directed acyclic graphs or, equivalently, partially ordered sets. In these applications, the goal is to find a sparsest Steiner k-TC-spanner of a poset G for a given k and G. The focus of this paper is the relationship between the dimension of a poset and the size of its sparsest Steiner TCspanner. The dimension of a poset G is the smallest d such that G can be embedded into a d-dimensional directed hypergrid via an order-preserving embedding. We present a nearly tight lower bound on the size of Steiner 2-TC-spanners of d-dimensional directed hypergrids. It implies better lower bounds on the complexity of local reconstructors of monotone functions and functions with low Lipschitz constant. The proof of the lower bound constructs a dual solution to a linear programming relaxation of the Steiner 2-TC-spanner problem. We also show that one can efficiently construct a Steiner 2-TC-spanner, of size matching the lower bound, for any low-dimensional poset. Finally, we present a lower bound on the size of Steiner k-TC-spanners of d-dimensional posets that shows that the best-known construction, due to De Santis et al., cannot be improved significantly.',

	{'abstract': u'In this paper we consider the problem of high accuracy localization of mobile nodes in a multipath-rich environment where sub-meter accuracies are required. We employ a peer to peer framework where the vehicles/nodes can get pairwise multipath-degraded ranging estimates in local neighborhoods together with a fixed number of anchor nodes. The challenge is to overcome the multipath-barrier with redundancy in order to provide the desired accuracies especially under severe multipath conditions when the fraction of received signals corrupted by multipath is dominating. We invoke a message passing analytical framework based on particle filtering and reveal its high accuracy localization promise through simulations.',

	{'abstract': u"In this paper we discuss the ability of channel codes to enhance cryptographic secrecy. Toward that end, we present the secrecy metric of degrees of freedom in an attacker's knowledge of the cryptogram, which is similar to equivocation. Using this notion of secrecy, we show how a specific practical channel coding system can be used to hide information about the ciphertext, thus increasing the difficulty of cryptographic attacks. The system setup is the wiretap channel model where transmitted data traverse through independent packet erasure channels with public feedback for authenticated ARQ (Automatic Repeat reQuest). The code design relies on puncturing nonsystematic low-density parity-check codes with the intent of inflicting an eavesdropper with stopping sets in the decoder. Furthermore, the design amplifies errors when stopping sets occur such that a receiver must guess all the channel-erased bits correctly to avoid an expected error rate of one half in the ciphertext. We extend previous results on the coding scheme by giving design criteria that reduces the effectiveness of a maximum-likelihood attack to that of a message-passing attack. We further extend security analysis to models with multiple receivers and collaborative attackers. Cryptographic security is enhanced in all these cases by exploiting properties of the physical-layer. The enhancement is accurately presented as a function of the degrees of freedom in the eavesdropper's knowledge of the ciphertext, and is even shown to be present when eavesdroppers have better channel quality than legitimate receivers.",

	{'abstract': u"In this paper, we consider rendering color videos using a non-photo-realistic art form technique commonly called stippling. Stippling is the art of rendering images using point sets, possibly with various attributes like sizes, elementary shapes, and colors. Producing nice stippling is attractive not only for the sake of image depiction but also because it yields a compact vectorial format for storing the semantic information of media. Moreover, stippling is by construction easily tunable to various device resolutions without suffering from bitmap sampling artifacts when resizing. The underlying core technique for stippling images is to compute a centroidal Voronoi tessellation on a well-designed underlying density. This density relates to the image content, and is used to compute a weighted Voronoi diagram. By considering videos as image sequences and initializing properly the stippling of one image by the result of its predecessor, one avoids undesirable point flickering artifacts and can produce stippled videos that nevertheless still exhibit noticeable artifacts. To overcome this, our method improves over the naive scheme by considering dynamic point creation and deletion according to the current scene semantic complexity, and show how to effectively vectorize video while adjusting for both color and contrast characteristics. Furthermore, we explain how to produce high quality stippled ``videos'' (eg., fully dynamic spatio-temporal point sets) for media containing various fading effects, like quick motions of objects or progressive shot changes. We report on practical performances of our implementation, and present several stippled video results rendered on-the-fly using our viewer that allows both spatio-temporal dynamic rescaling (eg., upscale vectorially frame rate).",

	{'abstract': u'Concurrency has been rapidly gaining importance in general-purpose computing, caused by the recent turn towards multicore processing architectures. As a result, an increasing number of developers have to learn to write concurrent programs, a task that is known to be hard even for the expert. Language designers are therefore working on languages that promise to make concurrent programming "easier" than using traditional thread libraries. However, the claim that a new language is more usable than another cannot be supported by purely theoretical considerations, but calls for empirical studies. In this paper, we present the design of a study to compare concurrent programming languages with respect to comprehending and debugging existing programs and writing correct new programs. A critical challenge for such a study is avoiding the bias that might be introduced during the training phase and when interpreting participants\' solutions. We address these issues by the use of self-study material and an evaluation scheme that exposes any subjective decisions of the corrector, or eliminates them altogether. We apply our design to a comparison of two object-oriented languages for concurrency, multithreaded Java and SCOOP (Simple Concurrent Object-Oriented Programming), in an academic setting. We obtain results in favor of SCOOP even though the study participants had previous training in Java Threads.',

	{'abstract': u'A 60 GHz wireless Gigabit Ethernet (G.E.) communication system capable of near gigabit data rate has been developed at IETR. The realized system covers 2 GHz available bandwidth. This paper describes the design and realization of the overall system including the baseband (BB), intermediate frequency (IF) and radiofrequency (RF) blocks. A differential binary shift keying (DBPSK) modulation and a differential demodulation are adopted at IF. In the BB processing block, an original byte/frame synchronization technique is designed to provide a small value of the preamble false alarm and missing probabilities. For the system performances, two different real scenarios are investigated: measurements carried out in a large gym and in hallways. Bit error rate (BER) measurements have been performed in different configurations: with/without RS (255, 239) coding, with frame synchronization using 32/64 bits preambles. As shown by simulation, the 64 bits preamble provides sufficient robustness and improves the system performance in term of BER. At a data rate of 875 Mbps, a BER of 10-8 was measured at 30 m using high gain antennas for line of-sight (LOS) conditions.',

	{'abstract': u'In this work we study zero vs. epsilon-error capacity in network coding instances. For multicast network coding it is well known that all rates that can be delivered with arbitrarily small error probability can also be delivered with zero error probability; that is, the epsilon-error multicast capacity region and zero-error multicast capacity region are identical. For general network coding instances in which all sources originate at the same source node, Chan and Grant recently showed [ISIT 2010] that, again, epsilon-error communication has no rate advantage over zero-error communication. We start by revisiting the setting of co-located sources, where we present an alternative proof to that given by Chan and Grant. While the new proof is based on similar core ideas, our constructive strategy complements the previous argument.We then extend our results to the setting of index coding, which is a special and representative form of network coding that encapsulates the "source coding with side information" problem. Finally, we consider the "edge removal" problem (recently studied by Jalali, Effros, and Ho in [Allerton 2010] and [ITA 2011]) that aims to quantify the loss in capacity associated with removing a single edge from a given network. Using our proof for co-located sources, we tie the "zero vs. epsilon-error" problem in general network coding instances with the "edge removal" problem. Loosely speaking, we show that the two problem are equivalent.',

	{'abstract': u'During the past few years, we have observed the emergence of new applications that use multicast transmission. For a multicast routing algorithm to be applicable in optical networks, it must route data only to group members, optimize and maintain loop-free routes, and concentrate the routes on a subset of network links. For an all-optical switch to play the role of a branching router, it must be equipped with a light splitter. Light splitters are expensive equipments and therefore it will be very expensive to implement splitters on all optical switches. Optical light splitters are only implemented on some optical switches. That limited availability of light splitters raises a new problem when we want to implement multicast protocols in optical network (because usual multicast protocols make the assumption that all nodes have branching capabilities). Another issue is the knowledge of the locations of light splitters in the optical network. Nodes in the network should be able to identify the locations of light splitters scattered in the optical network so it can construct multicast trees. These problems must be resolved by implementing a multicast routing protocol that must take into consideration that not all nodes can be branching node. As a result, a new signaling process must be implemented so that light paths can be created, spanning from source to the group members.',

	{'abstract': u'Recently, Vontobel showed the relationship between Bethe free energy and annealed free energy for protograph factor graph ensembles. In this paper, annealed free energy of any random regular, irregular and Poisson factor graph ensembles are connected to Bethe free energy. The annealed free energy is expressed as the solution of maximization problem whose stationary condition equations coincide with equations of belief propagation since the contribution to partition function of particular type of variable and factor nodes has similar form of minus Bethe free energy. It gives simple derivation of replica symmetric solution. As consequence, it is shown that on replica symmetric ansatz, replica symmetric solution and annealed free energy are equal for regular ensemble.',

	{'abstract': u'This paper introduces a novel type of memetic algorithm based Topology and Weight Evolving Artificial Neural Network (TWEANN) system called DX Neural Network (DXNN). DXNN implements a number of interesting features, amongst which is: a simple and database friendly tuple based encoding method, a 2 phase neuroevolutionary approach aimed at removing the need for speciation due to its intrinsic population diversification effects, a new "Targeted Tuning Phase" aimed at dealing with "the curse of dimensionality", and a new Random Intensity Mutation (RIM) method that removes the need for crossover algorithms. The paper will discuss DXNN\'s architecture, mutation operators, and its built in feature selection method that allows for the evolved systems to expand and incorporate new sensors and actuators. I then compare DXNN to other state of the art TWEANNs on the standard double pole balancing benchmark, and demonstrate its superior ability to evolve highly compact solutions faster than its competitors. Then a set of oblation experiments is performed to demonstrate how each feature of DXNN effects its performance, followed by a set of experiments which demonstrate the platform\'s ability to create NN populations with exceptionally high diversity profiles. Finally, DXNN is used to evolve artificial robots in a set of two dimensional open-ended food gathering and predator-prey simulations, demonstrating the system\'s ability to produce ever more complex Neural Networks, and the system\'s applicability to the domain of robotics, artificial life, and coevolution.',

	{'abstract': u"The cognitive interference channel with unidirectional destination cooperation (CIFC-UDC) is a cognitive interference channel (CIFC) where the cognitive (secondary) destination not only decodes the information sent from its sending dual but also helps enhance the communication of the primary user. This channel model is an extension of the original CIFC to achieve a win-win solution under the coexistence condition. From an information-theoretic perspective, the CIFC-UDC comprises a broadcast channel (BC), a relay channel (RC) and a partially cooperative relay broadcast channel (PCRBC), and can be degraded to any one of them. Our main result is the establishment of a new unified achieva-ble rate region for the CIFC-UDC which is the largest known to date and can be explicitly shown to include the previous result proposed by Chu and the largest known rate regions for the BC, the RC and the PCRBC. In addition, an interesting viewpoint on the unidirectional destination cooperation in the CIFC-UDC is discussed: to enable the decoder of the primary user to perform interference mitigation can be considered as a complementary idea to the interference mitigation via Gel'fand-Pinsker precod-ing in the CIFC proposed by Devroye et al. Henceforth, by com-bing these two ideas, the interferences caused at both the desti-nations can be alleviated. Lastly, an outer bound is presented and proved to be tight for a class of the CIFC-UDC, resulting in the characterization of the capacity region for this class.",

	{'abstract': u'In this paper, we propose a selection region based multihop routing protocol with directional antennas for wireless mobile ad hoc networks, where the selection region is defined by two parameters: a reference distance and the beamwidth of the directional antenna. At each hop, we choose the nearest node to the transmitter within the selection region as the next hop relay. By maximizing the expected density of progress, we present an upper bound for the optimum reference distance and derive the relationship between the optimum reference distance and the optimum transmission probability. Compared with the results with routing strategy using omnidirectional antennas in cite, we find interestingly that the optimum transmission probability is a constant independent of the beamwidth, the expected density of progress with the new routing strategy is increased significantly, and the computational complexity involved in the relay selection is also greatly reduced.',

	{'abstract': u'In this paper, we propose a novel adaptive modulation and coding (AMC) algorithm dedicated to reduce the feedback frequency of the channel state information (CSI). There have been already plenty of works on AMC so as to exploit the bandwidth more efficiently with the CSI feedback to the transmitter. However, in some occasions, frequent CSI feedback is not favorable in these systems. This work considers finite-state Markov chain (FSMC) based channel prediction to alleviate the feedback while maximizing the overall throughput. We derive the close-form of the frame error rate (FER) based on channel prediction using limited CSI feedback. In addition, instead of switching settings according to the CSI, we also provide means to combine both CSI and FER as the switching parameter. Numerical results illustrate that the average throughput of the proposed algorithm has significant performance improvement over fixed modulation and coding while the CSI feedback being largely reduced.',

	{'abstract': u'The tolerancing step has a great importance in the design process. It characterises the relationship between the different sectors of the product life cycle: Design, Manufacturing and Control. We can distinguish several methods to assist the tolerancing process in the design. Based on arithmetic and statistical method, this paper presents a new approach of analysis and verification of tolerances. The chosen approach is based on the Worst Case Method as an arithmetic method and Monte Carlo method as a statistical method. In this paper, we compare these methods and we present our main approach, which is validated using an example of 1 D tolerancing.',

	{'abstract': u'In automata theory, the quantum computation has been widely examined for finite state machines, known as quantum finite automata (QFAs), and less attention has been given to the QFAs augmented with counters or stacks. Moreover, to our knowledge, there is no result related to QFAs having more than one input head. In this paper, we focus on such generalizations of QFAs whose input head(s) operate(s) in one-way or realtime mode and present many superiority of them to their classical counterparts. Furthermore, we propose some open problems and conjectures in order to investigate the power of quantumness better. We also give some new results on classical computation.',

	{'abstract': u'The goal of this paper is the development of a novel approach for the problem of Noise Removal, based on the theory of Reproducing Kernels Hilbert Spaces (RKHS). The problem is cast as an optimization task in a RKHS, by taking advantage of the celebrated semiparametric Representer Theorem. Examples verify that in the presence of gaussian noise the proposed method performs relatively well compared to wavelet based technics and outperforms them significantly in the presence of impulse or mixed noise.

	{'abstract': u"This paper considers a communication network comprised of two nodes, which have no mutual direct communication links, communicating two-way with the aid of a common relay node (RN), also known as separated two-way relay (TWR) channel. We first recall a cut-set outer bound for the set of rates in the context of this network topology assuming full-duplex transmission capabilities. Then, we derive a new achievable rate region based on hash-and-forward (HF) relaying where the RN does not attempt to decode but instead hashes its received signal, and show that under certain channel conditions it coincides with Shannon's inner-bound for the two-way channel [1]. Moreover, for binary adder TWR channel with additive noise at the nodes and the RN we provide a detailed capacity achieving coding scheme based on structure codes.",

We formally prove the correctness of our approach. We show that the complexity of finding a policy for a reinforcement learning problem in our approach is NP-complete. In addition, we show that any reinforcement learning problem can be encoded as a classical logic program with answer set semantics. We also show that a reinforcement learning problem can be encoded as a SAT problem. We present a new high level action description language that allows the factored representation of POMDP. Moreover, we modify the original model of POMDP so that it be able to distinguish between knowledge producing actions and actions that change the environment.',

Based on these bits, the reconstructor wishes to select a subset of that contains all the points in the pattern. It is shown that, if the point pattern is produced by a homogeneous Poisson process of intensity , and if the reconstructor is restricted to select a subset of average Lebesgue measure not exceeding , then, as tends to infinity, the minimum number of bits per second needed by the encoder is . It is also shown that, as tends to infinity, any point pattern on containing no more than points can be successfully described using bits per second in this sense.

	{'abstract': u"It is known that a high-dimensional sparse vector x* in R^n can be recovered from low-dimensional measurements y= A^ x* (m&lt;n) . In this paper, we investigate the recovering ability of l_p-minimization (0&lt;=p&lt;=1) as p varies, where l_p-minimization returns a vector with the least l_p ``norm'' among all the vectors x satisfying Ax=y. Besides analyzing the performance of strong recovery where l_p-minimization needs to recover all the sparse vectors up to certain sparsity, we also for the first time analyze the performance of ``weak'' recovery of l_p-minimization (0&lt;=p&lt;1) where the aim is to recover all the sparse vectors on one support with fixed sign pattern. When m/n goes to 1, we provide sharp thresholds of the sparsity ratio that differentiates the success and failure via l_p-minimization. For strong recovery, the threshold strictly decreases from 0.5 to 0.239 as p increases from 0 to 1. Surprisingly, for weak recovery, the threshold is 2/3 for all p in [0,1), while the threshold is 1 for l_1-minimization. We also explicitly demonstrate that l_p-minimization (p&lt;1) can return a denser solution than l_1-minimization. For any m/n&lt;1, we provide bounds of sparsity ratio for strong recovery and weak recovery respectively below which l_p-minimization succeeds with overwhelming probability. Our bound of strong recovery improves on the existing bounds when m/n is large. Regarding the recovery threshold, l_p-minimization has a higher threshold with smaller p for strong recovery; the threshold is the same for all p for sectional recovery; and l_1-minimization can outperform l_p-minimization for weak recovery. These are in contrast to traditional wisdom that l_p-minimization has better sparse recovery ability than l_1-minimization since it is closer to l_0-minimization. We provide an intuitive explanation to our findings and use numerical examples to illustrate the theoretical predictions.",

	{'abstract': u'In this paper we study the strengths and limitations of collaborative teams of simple agents. In particular, we discuss the efficient use of "ant robots" for covering a connected region on the Z^ grid, whose area is unknown in advance, and which expands at a given rate, where is the initial size of the connected region. We show that regardless of the algorithm used, and the robots\' hardware and software specifications, the minimal number of robots required in order for such coverage to be possible is Omega(). In addition, we show that when the region expands at a sufficiently slow rate, a team of Theta( sqrt) robots could cover it in at most O(n^ ln n) time. This completion time can even be achieved by myopic robots, with no ability to directly communicate with each other, and where each robot is equipped with a memory of size O(1) bits w.r.t the size of the region (therefore, the robots cannot maintain maps of the terrain, nor plan complete paths). Regarding the coverage of non-expanding regions in the grid, we improve the current best known result of O(n^) by demonstrating an algorithm that guarantees such a coverage with completion time of O( frac n^ + n) in the worst case, and faster for shapes of perimeter length which is shorter than O(n).',

	{'abstract': u'Open Answer Set Programming (OASP) is an attractive framework for integrating ontologies and rules. In general OASP is undecidable. In previous work we provided a tableau-based algorithm for satisfiability checking w.r.t. forest logic programs, a decidable fragment of OASP, which has the forest model property. In this paper we introduce an optimized version of that algorithm achieved by means of a knowledge compilation technique. So-called unit completion structures, which are possible building blocks of a forest model, in the form of trees of depth 1, are computed in an initial step of the algorithm. Repeated computations are avoided by using these structures in a pattern-matching style when constructing a model. Furthermore we identify and discard redundant unit completion structures: a structure is redundant if there is another structure which can always replace the original structure in a forest model.',

	{'abstract': u'In this paper, we study cyclic stabiliser codes over of length dividing for some positive integer . We call these -Frobenius codes or just Frobenius codes for short. We give methods to construct them and show that they have efficient decoding algorithms. An important subclass of stabiliser codes are the linear stabiliser codes. For linear Frobenius codes we have stronger results: We completely characterise all linear Frobenius codes. As a consequence, we show that for every integer that divides for an odd , there are no linear cyclic codes of length . On the other hand for even , we give an explicit method to construct all of them. This gives us a many explicit example of Frobenius codes which include the well studied Laflamme code. We show that the classical notion of BCH distance can be generalised to all the Frobenius codes that we construct, including the non-linear ones, and show that the algorithm of Berlekamp can be generalised to correct quantum errors within the BCH limit. This gives, for the first time, a family of codes that are neither CSS nor linear for which efficient decoding algorithm exits. The explicit examples that we construct are summarised in Table ref and explained in detail in Tables ref (linear case) and ref (non-linear case).',

	{'abstract': u'Multivariate linear regression models suggest a trade-off in allocations of national R&amp;D investments. Government funding, and spending in the higher education sector, seem to encourage publications, whereas other components such as industrial funding, and spending in the business sector, encourage patenting. Our results help explain why the US trails the EU in publications, because of its focus on industrial funding - some 70% of its total R&amp;D investment. Conversely, it also helps explain why the EU trails the US in patenting. Government funding is indicated as a negative incentive to high-quality patenting. The models here can also be used to predict an output indicator for a country, once the appropriate input indicator is known. This usually is done within a dataset for a single year, but the process can be extended to predict outputs a few years into the future, if reasonable forecasts can be made of the input indicators. We provide new forecasts about the further relationships of the US, the EU-27, and the PRC in the case of publishing. Models for individual countries may be more successful, however, than regression models whose parameters are averaged over a set of countries.',

	{'abstract': u'In cloud computing environments, a large number of users access data stored in highly available storage systems. To provide good performance to geographically disperse users and allow operation even in the presence of failures or network partitions, these systems often rely on optimistic replication solutions that guarantee only eventual consistency. In this scenario, it is important to be able to accurately and efficiently identify updates executed concurrently. In this paper, first we review, and expose problems with current approaches to causality tracking in optimistic replication: these either lose information about causality or do not scale, as they require replicas to maintain information that grows linearly with the number of clients or updates. Then, we propose a novel solution that fully captures causality while being very concise in that it maintains information that grows linearly only with the number of servers that register updates for a given data element, bounded by the degree of replication.',

	{'abstract': u'In this work, the joint precoding across two distant transmitters (TXs), sharing the knowledge of the data symbols to be transmitted, to two receivers (RXs), each equipped with one antenna, is discussed. We consider a distributed channel state information (CSI) configuration where each TX has its own local estimate of the channel and no communication is possible between the TXs. Based on the distributed CSI configuration, we introduce a concept of distributed MIMO precoding. We focus on the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime such that the two TXs aim at designing a precoding matrix to cancel the interference. Building on the study of the multiple antenna broadcast channel, we obtain the following key results: We derive the multiplexing gain (MG) as a function of the scaling in the SNR of the number of bits quantizing at each TX the channel to a given RX. Particularly, we show that the conventional Zero Forcing precoder is not MG maximizing, and we provide a precoding scheme optimal in terms of MG. Beyond the established MG optimality, simulations show that the proposed precoding schemes achieve better performances at intermediate SNR than known linear precoders.',

	{'abstract': u'We present probabilistic arithmetic automata (PAAs), a general model to describe chains of operations whose operands depend on chance, along with two different algorithms to exactly calculate the distribution of the results obtained by such probabilistic calculations. PAAs provide a unifying framework to approach many problems arising in computational biology and elsewhere. Here, we present five different applications, namely (1) pattern matching statistics on random texts, including the computation of the distribution of occurrence counts, waiting time and clump size under HMM background models; (2) exact analysis of window-based pattern matching algorithms; (3) sensitivity of filtration seeds used to detect candidate sequence alignments; (4) length and mass statistics of peptide fragments resulting from enzymatic cleavage reactions; and (5) read length statistics of 454 sequencing reads. The diversity of these applications indicates the flexibility and unifying character of the presented framework. While the construction of a PAA depends on the particular application, we single out a frequently applicable construction method for pattern statistics: We introduce deterministic arithmetic automata (DAAs) to model deterministic calculations on sequences, and demonstrate how to construct a PAA from a given DAA and a finite-memory random text model. We show how to transform a finite automaton into a DAA and then into the corresponding PAA.',

This is of a significant practical interest, since it has a potential to generate additional value of the systems through, for example, introduction of new devices and only a software update of the access points or base stations, without incurring additional cost for infrastructure hardware installation. The place to look for such an opportunity is the communication protocol and we use the term *protocol coding* to refer to strategies for sending information by using the degrees of freedom available when one needs to decide the actions taken by a particular communication protocol. In this paper we consider protocol coding that gives a rise to *secondary communication channels*, defined by combinatorial ordering of the user resources (packets, channels) in a primary (legacy) communication system. We introduce communication models that enable us to compute the capacity of such secondary channels under suitable restrictions imposed by the primary systems. We first show the relation to the capacity of channels with causal channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT), originally considered by Shannon. By using the specific communication setup, we develop an alternative framework for achieving the capacity and we discuss coding strategies that need to be used over the secondary channels. We also discuss some practical features of the secondary channels and their applications that add value to the existing wireless systems.',

	{'abstract': u'The Honey-Bee game is a two-player board game that is played on a connected hexagonal colored grid or (in a generalized setting) on a connected graph with colored nodes. In a single move, a player calls a color and thereby conquers all the nodes of that color that are adjacent to his own current territory. Both players want to conquer the majority of the nodes. We show that winning the game is PSPACE-hard in general, NP-hard on series-parallel graphs, but easy on outerplanar graphs. In the solitaire version, the goal of the single player is to conquer the entire graph with the minimum number of moves. The solitaire version is NP-hard on trees and split graphs, but can be solved in polynomial time on co-comparability graphs.',

	{'abstract': u'This chapter derives the properties of light from the properties of processing, including its ability to be both a wave and a particle, to respond to objects it doesn\'t physically touch, to take all paths to a destination, to choose a route after it arrives, and to spin both ways at once as it moves. Here a photon is an entity program spreading as a processing wave of instances. It becomes a "particle" if any part of it overloads the grid network that runs it, causing the photon program to reboot and restart at a new node. The "collapse of the wave function" is how quantum processing creates what we call a physical photon. This informational approach gives insights into issues like the law of least action, entanglement, superposition, counterfactuals, the holographic principle and the measurement problem. The conceptual cost is that physical reality is a quantum processing output, i.e. virtual.',

	{'abstract': u'Performance and reliability of content access in mobile networks is conditioned by the number and location of content replicas deployed at the network nodes. Location theory has been the traditional, centralized approach to study content replication: computing the number and placement of replicas in a static network can be cast as a facility location problem. The endeavor of this work is to design a practical solution to the above joint optimization problem that is suitable for mobile wireless environments. We thus seek a replication algorithm that is lightweight, distributed, and reactive to network dynamics. We devise a solution that lets nodes (i) share the burden of storing and providing content, so as to achieve load balancing, and (ii) autonomously decide whether to replicate or drop the information, so as to adapt the content availability to dynamic demands and time-varying network topologies. We evaluate our mechanism through simulation, by exploring a wide range of settings, including different node mobility models, content characteristics and system scales. Furthermore, we compare our mechanism to state-of-the-art approaches to content delivery in static and mobile networks. Results show that our mechanism, which uses local measurements only, is: (i) extremely precise in approximating an optimal solution to content placement and replication; (ii) robust against network mobility; (iii) flexible in accommodating various content access patterns. Moreover, our scheme outperforms alternative approaches to content dissemination both in terms of content access delay and access congestion.',

	{'abstract': u'We determine necessary conditions on the structure of symbol error rate (SER) optimal quantizers for limited feedback beamforming in wireless networks with one transmitter-receiver pair and R parallel amplify-and-forward relays. We call a quantizer codebook "small" if its cardinality is less than R, and "large" otherwise. A "d-codebook" depends on the power constraints and can be optimized accordingly, while an "i-codebook" remains fixed. It was previously shown that any i-codebook that contains the single-relay selection (SRS) codebook achieves the full-diversity order, R. We prove the following: Every full-diversity i-codebook contains the SRS codebook, and thus is necessarily large. In general, as the power constraints grow to infinity, the limit of an optimal large d-codebook contains an SRS codebook, provided that it exists. For small codebooks, the maximal diversity is equal to the codebook cardinality. Every diversity-optimal small i-codebook is an orthogonal multiple-relay selection (OMRS) codebook. Moreover, the limit of an optimal small d-codebook is an OMRS codebook. We observe that SRS is nothing but a special case of OMRS for codebooks with cardinality equal to R. As a result, we call OMRS as "the universal necessary condition" for codebook optimality. Finally, we confirm our analytical findings through simulations.',

	{'abstract': u'In a previous FAST paper, I presented a quantitative model of the process of trust building, and showed that trust is accumulated like wealth: the rich get richer. This explained the pervasive phenomenon of adverse selection of trust certificates, as well as the fragility of trust networks in general. But a simple explanation does not always suggest a simple solution. It turns out that it is impossible to alter the fragile distribution of trust without sacrificing some of its fundamental functions. A solution for the vulnerability of trust must thus be sought elsewhere, without tampering with its distribution. This observation was the starting point of the present paper. It explores a different method for securing trust: not by redistributing it, but by mining for its sources. The method used to break privacy is thus also used to secure trust. A high level view of the mining methods that connect the two is provided in terms of *similarity networks*, and *spectral decomposition* of similarity preserving maps. This view may be of independent interest, as it uncovers a common conceptual and structural foundation of mathematical classification theory on one hand, and of the spectral methods of graph clustering and data mining on the other hand.',

	{'abstract': u'The depth of a visible surface of a scene is the distance between the surface and the sensor. Recovering depth information from two-dimensional images of a scene is an important task in computer vision that can assist numerous applications such as object recognition, scene interpretation, obstacle avoidance, inspection and assembly. Various passive depth computation techniques have been developed for computer vision applications. They can be classified into two groups. The first group operates using just one image. The second group requires more than one image which can be acquired using either multiple cameras or a camera whose parameters and positioning can be changed. This project is aimed to find the real depth of the object from the camera which had been used to click the photograph. An n-degree polynomial was formulated, which maps the pixel depth of an image to the real depth. In order to find the coefficients of the polynomial, an experiment was carried out for a particular lens and thus, these coefficients are a unique feature of a particular camera. The procedure explained in this report is a monocular approach for estimation of depth of a scene. The idea involves mapping the Pixel Depth of the object photographed in the image with the Real Depth of the object from the camera lens with an interpolation function. In order to find the parameters of the interpolation function, a set of lines with predefined distance from camera is used, and then the distance of each line from the bottom edge of the picture (as the origin line) is calculated.',

	{'abstract': u'We study a class of stochastic dynamic games that exhibit strategic complementarities between players; formally, in the games we consider, the payoff of a player has increasing differences between her own state and the empirical distribution of the states of other players. Such games can be used to model a diverse set of applications, including network security models, recommender systems, and dynamic search in markets. Stochastic games are generally difficult to analyze, and these difficulties are only exacerbated when the number of players is large (as might be the case in the preceding examples). We consider an approximation methodology called mean field equilibrium to study these games. In such an equilibrium, each player reacts to only the long run average state of other players. We find necessary conditions for the existence of a mean field equilibrium in such games. Furthermore, as a simple consequence of this existence theorem, we obtain several natural monotonicity properties. We show that there exist a "largest" and a "smallest" equilibrium among all those where the equilibrium strategy used by a player is nondecreasing, and we also show that players converge to each of these equilibria via natural myopic learning dynamics; as we argue, these dynamics are more reasonable than the standard best response dynamics. We also provide sensitivity results, where we quantify how the equilibria of such games move in response to changes in parameters of the game (e.g., the introduction of incentives to players).',

	{'abstract': u'As the structural databases continue to expand, efficient methods are required to search similar structures of the query structure from the database. There are many previous works about comparing protein 3D structures and scanning the database with a query structure. However, they generally have limitations on practical use because of large computational and storage requirements. We propose two new types of queries for searching similar sub-structures on the structural database: LSPM (Local Spatial Pattern Matching) and RLSPM (Reverse LSPM). Between two types of queries, we focus on RLSPM problem, because it is more practical and general than LSPM. As a naive algorithm, we adopt geometric hashing techniques to RLSPM problem and then propose our proposed algorithm which improves the baseline algorithm to deal with large-scale data and provide an efficient matching algorithm. We employ the sub-sampling and Z-ordering to reduce the storage requirement and execution time, respectively. We conduct our experiments to show the correctness and reliability of the proposed method. Our experiment shows that the true positive rate is at least 0.8 using the reliability measure.',

It is well known that scheduling schemes that favor links with larger queue length can achieve high throughput performance. However, these queue-length-based schemes could potentially suffer from large (even infinite) packet delays due to the well-known last packet problem, whereby packets belonging to some flows may be excessively delayed due to lack of subsequent packet arrivals. Delay-based schemes have the potential to resolve this last packet problem by scheduling the link based on the delay the packet has encountered. However, characterizing throughput-optimality of these delay-based schemes has largely been an open problem in multihop wireless networks (except in limited cases where the traffic is single-hop.) In this paper, we investigate delay-based scheduling schemes for multihop traffic scenarios with fixed routes. We develop a scheduling scheme based on a new delay metric, and show that the proposed scheme achieves optimal throughput performance. Further, we conduct simulations to support our analytical results, and show that the delay-based scheduler successfully removes excessive packet delays, while it achieves the same throughput region as the queue-length-based scheme.',

Complementation of -automata is crucial in many of these applications. But the problem is non-trivial; even after extensive study during the past four decades, we still have an important type of -automata, namely Streett automata, for which the gap between the current best lower bound and upper bound is substantial, for the Streett index size can be exponential in the number of states .

	{'abstract': u'We give a novel algorithm for enumerating lattice points in any convex body, and give applications to several classic lattice problems, including the Shortest and Closest Vector Problems (SVP and CVP, respectively) and Integer Programming (IP). Our enumeration technique relies on a classical concept from asymptotic convex geometry known as the M-ellipsoid, and uses as a crucial subroutine the recent algorithm of Micciancio and Voulgaris (STOC 2010) for lattice problems in the l_2 norm. As a main technical contribution, which may be of independent interest, we build on the techniques of Klartag (Geometric and Functional Analysis, 2006) to give an expected 2^O(n)-time algorithm for computing an M-ellipsoid for any n-dimensional convex body. As applications, we give deterministic 2^-time and -space algorithms for solving exact SVP, and exact CVP when the target point is sufficiently close to the lattice, on n-dimensional lattices in any (semi-)norm given an M-ellipsoid of the unit ball. In many norms of interest, including all l_p norms, an M-ellipsoid is computable in deterministic poly(n) time, in which case these algorithms are fully deterministic. Here our approach may be seen as a derandomization of the "AKS sieve" for exact SVP and CVP (Ajtai, Kumar, and Sivakumar; STOC 2001 and CCC 2002). As a further application of our SVP algorithm, we derive an expected O(f*(n))^n-time algorithm for Integer Programming, where f*(n) denotes the optimal bound in the so-called "flatness theorem," which satisfies f*(n) = O(n^ polylog(n)) and is conjectured to be f*(n)= Theta(n). Our runtime improves upon the previous best of O(n^)^ by Hildebrand and Koppe (2010).',

	{'abstract': u'Sensing and aggregation of noisy observations should not be considered as separate issues. The quality of collective estimation involves a difficult tradeoff between sensing quality which increases by increasing the number of sensors, and aggregation quality which typically decreases if the number of sensors is too large. We examine a strategy for optimal aggregation for an ensemble of independent sensors with constrained system capacity. We show that in the large capacity limit larger scale aggregation always outperforms smaller scale aggregation at higher noise levels, while below a critical value of noise, there exist moderate scale aggregation levels at which optimal estimation is realized.',

	{'abstract': u'To harmonize the individual architectures of the different commands, services, and agencies dealing with the development and procurement of Command, Control, Communications, Computing, Surveillance, Reconnaissance, and Intelligence (C4ISR) systems, the C4ISR Architecture Framework was developed based on existing and matured modeling techniques and methods. Within a short period, NATO adapted this method family as the NATO Consultation, Command, and Control (C3) System Architecture Framework to harmonize the efforts of the different nations. Based on these products, for every system to be fielded to be used in the US Armed Forces, a C4I Support Plan (C4ISP) has to be developed enabling the integration of the special system into the integrated C4I Architecture. The tool set proposed by these architecture frameworks connects operational views of the military user, system views of the developers, and the technical views for standards and integration methods needed to make the network centric system of systems work. The tools are therefore logically a valuable backbone for Verification, Validation, and Accreditation (VV&amp;A). Their application is not limited to C4ISR systems; they can be used to define requirements and connected solutions and algorithms of Modeling and Simulation (M&amp;S) systems as well. Especially for M&amp;S systems to be used in connection with C4ISR system, the use of the C4ISR Architecture Framework would not only be a help, but can nearly be seen to be necessary to avoid double work and foster reuse and interoperability from the first stages of a project on. To enable the reader to build his own picture, the respective tools used and their application in the context of VV&amp;A will be explained in form of an overview.',

	{'abstract': u"The closest vector problem (CVP) and shortest (nonzero) vector problem (SVP) are the core algorithmic problems on Euclidean lattices. They are central to the applications of lattices in many problems of communications and cryptography. Kannan's emph is a powerful technique for solving the approximate CVP, yet its remarkable practical performance is not well understood. In this paper, the embedding technique is analyzed from a emph (BDD) viewpoint. We present two complementary analyses of the embedding technique: We establish a reduction from BDD to Hermite SVP (via unique SVP), which can be used along with any Hermite SVP solver (including, among others, the Lenstra, Lenstra and Lov 'asz (LLL) algorithm), and show that, in the special case of LLL, it performs at least as well as Babai's nearest plane algorithm (LLL-aided SIC). The former analysis helps to explain the folklore practical observation that unique SVP is easier than standard approximate SVP. It is proven that when the LLL algorithm is employed, the embedding technique can solve the CVP provided that the noise norm is smaller than a decoding radius , where is the minimum distance of the lattice, and . This substantially improves the previously best known correct decoding bound . Focusing on the applications of BDD to decoding of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, we also prove that BDD of the regularized lattice is optimal in terms of the diversity-multiplexing gain tradeoff (DMT), and propose practical variants of embedding decoding which require no knowledge of the minimum distance of the lattice and/or further improve the error performance.",

	{'abstract': u'Finding an appropriate turbulence model for a given flow case usually calls for extensive experimentation with both models and numerical solution methods. This work presents the design and implementation of a flexible, programmable software framework for assisting with numerical experiments in computational turbulence. The framework targets Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes models, discretized by finite element methods. The novel implementation makes use of Python and the FEniCS package, the combination of which leads to compact and reusable code, where model- and solver-specific code resemble closely the mathematical formulation of equations and algorithms. The presented ideas and programming techniques are also applicable to other fields that involve systems of nonlinear partial differential equations. We demonstrate the framework in two applications and investigate the impact of various linearizations on the convergence properties of nonlinear solvers for a Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes model.',

	{'abstract': u'We study the stability of a Markovian model of electricity production and consumption that incorporates production volatility due to renewables and uncertainty about actual demand versus planned production. We assume that the energy producer targets a fixed energy reserve, subject to ramp-up and ramp-down constraints, and that appliances are subject to demand-response signals and adjust their consumption to the available production by delaying their demand. When a constant fraction of the delayed demand vanishes over time, we show that the general state Markov chain characterizing the system is positive Harris and ergodic (i.e., delayed demand is bounded with high probability). However, when delayed demand increases by a constant fraction over time, we show that the Markov chain is non-positive (i.e., there exists a non-zero probability that delayed demand becomes unbounded). We exhibit Lyapunov functions to prove our claims. In addition, we provide examples of heating appliances that, when delayed, have energy requirements corresponding to the two considered cases.',

	{'abstract': u"Raz's recent result cite has rekindled people's interest in the study of emph, the generalization of matrix rank to high dimensions, by showing its connections to arithmetic formulas. In this paper, we follow Raz's work and show that emph, the monotone variant of tensor rank and matrix rank, has applications in algebraic complexity, quantum computing and communication complexity. This paper differs from Raz's paper in that it leverages existing results to show unconditional bounds while Raz's result relies on some assumptions. We show a super-exponential separation between monotone and non-monotone computation in the non-commutative model, and thus provide a strong solution to Nisan's question cite in algebraic complexity. More specifically, we exhibit that there exists a homogeneous algebraic function of degree ( even) on variables with the monotone algebraic branching program (ABP) complexity and the non-monotone ABP complexity . In Bell's theorem cite, a basic assumption is that players have free will, and under such an assumption, local hidden variable theory still cannot predict the correlations produced by quantum mechanics. Using tools from monotone rank, we show that even if we disallow the players to have free will, local hidden variable theory still cannot predict the correlations produced by quantum mechanics. We generalize the log-rank conjecture cite in communication complexity to the multiparty case, and prove that for super-polynomial parties, there is a super-polynomial separation between the deterministic communication complexity and the logarithm of the rank of the communication tensor. This means that the log-rank conjecture does not hold in high dimensions.",

	{'abstract': u'The neighbourhood function N(t) of a graph G gives, for each t, the number of pairs of nodes &lt;x, y&gt; such that y is reachable from x in less that t hops. The neighbourhood function provides a wealth of information about the graph (e.g., it easily allows one to compute its diameter), but it is very expensive to compute it exactly. Recently, the ANF algorithm (approximate neighbourhood function) has been proposed with the purpose of approximating NG(t) on large graphs. We describe a breakthrough improvement over ANF in terms of speed and scalability. Our algorithm, called HyperANF, uses the new HyperLogLog counters and combines them efficiently through broadword programming; our implementation uses overdecomposition to exploit multi-core parallelism. With HyperANF, for the first time we can compute in a few hours the neighbourhood function of graphs with billions of nodes with a small error and good confidence using a standard workstation. Then, we turn to the study of the distribution of the shortest paths between reachable nodes (that can be efficiently approximated by means of HyperANF), and discover the surprising fact that its index of dispersion provides a clear-cut characterisation of proper social networks vs. web graphs. We thus propose the spid (Shortest-Paths Index of Dispersion) of a graph as a new, informative statistics that is able to discriminate between the above two types of graphs. We believe this is the first proposal of a significant new non-local structural index for complex networks whose computation is highly scalable.',

	{'abstract': u'In this paper, we present a new approach for the analysis of iterative node-based verification-based (NB-VB) recovery algorithms in the context of compressive sensing. These algorithms are particularly interesting due to their low complexity (linear in the signal dimension ). The asymptotic analysis predicts the fraction of unverified signal elements at each iteration in the asymptotic regime where . The analysis is similar in nature to the well-known density evolution technique commonly used to analyze iterative decoding algorithms. To perform the analysis, a message-passing interpretation of NB-VB algorithms is provided. This interpretation lacks the extrinsic nature of standard message-passing algorithms to which density evolution is usually applied. This requires a number of non-trivial modifications in the analysis. The analysis tracks the average performance of the recovery algorithms over the ensembles of input signals and sensing matrices as a function of . Concentration results are devised to demonstrate that the performance of the recovery algorithms applied to any choice of the input signal over any realization of the sensing matrix follows the deterministic results of the analysis closely. Simulation results are also provided which demonstrate that the proposed asymptotic analysis matches the performance of recovery algorithms for large but finite values of . Compared to the existing technique for the analysis of NB-VB algorithms, which is based on numerically solving a large system of coupled differential equations, the proposed method is much simpler and more accurate.',

	{'abstract': u'Understanding and modelling resources of Internet end hosts is essential for the design of desktop software and Internet-distributed applications. In this paper we develop a correlated resource model of Internet end hosts based on real trace data taken from the SETI@home project. This data covers a 5-year period with statistics for 2.7 million hosts. The resource model is based on statistical analysis of host computational power, memory, and storage as well as how these resources change over time and the correlations between them. We find that resources with few discrete values (core count, memory) are well modeled by exponential laws governing the change of relative resource quantities over time. Resources with a continuous range of values are well modeled with either correlated normal distributions (processor speed for integer operations and floating point operations) or log-normal distributions (available disk space). We validate and show the utility of the models by applying them to a resource allocation problem for Internet-distributed applications, and demonstrate their value over other models. We also make our trace data and tool for automatically generating realistic Internet end hosts publicly available.',

	{'abstract': u'Inferring cluster structure in microarray datasets is a fundamental task for the -omic sciences. A fundamental question in Statistics, Data Analysis and Classification, is the prediction of the number of clusters in a dataset, usually established via internal validation measures. Despite the wealth of internal measures available in the literature, new ones have been recently proposed, some of them specifically for microarray data. In this dissertation, a study of internal validation measures is given, paying particular attention to the stability based ones. Indeed, this class of measures is particularly prominent and promising in order to have a reliable estimate the number of clusters in a dataset. For those measures, a new general algorithmic paradigm is proposed here that highlights the richness of measures in this class and accounts for the ones already available in the literature. Moreover, some of the most representative validation measures are also considered. Experiments on 12 benchmark datasets are performed in order to assess both the intrinsic ability of a measure to predict the correct number of clusters in a dataset and its merit relative to the other measures. The main result is a hierarchy of internal validation measures in terms of precision and speed, highlighting some of their merits and limitations not reported before in the literature. This hierarchy shows that the faster the measure, the less accurate it is. In order to reduce the time performance gap between the fastest and the most precise measures, the technique of designing fast approximation algorithms is systematically applied. The end result is a speed-up of many of the measures studied here that brings the gap between the fastest and the most precise within one order of magnitude in time, with no degradation in their prediction power. Prior to this work, the time gap was at least two orders of magnitude.',

	{'abstract': u'A protocol for computing a functionality is secure if an adversary in this protocol cannot cause more harm than in an ideal computation where parties give their inputs to a trusted party which returns the output of the functionality to all parties. In particular, in the ideal model such computation is fair -- all parties get the output. Cleve (STOC 1986) proved that, in general, fairness is not possible without an honest majority. To overcome this impossibility, Gordon and Katz (Eurocrypt 2010) suggested a relaxed definition -- 1/p-secure computation -- which guarantees partial fairness. For two parties, they construct 1/p-secure protocols for functionalities for which the size of either their domain or their range is polynomial (in the security parameter). Gordon and Katz ask whether their results can be extended to multiparty protocols. We study 1/p-secure protocols in the multiparty setting for general functionalities. Our main result is constructions of 1/p-secure protocols when the number of parties is constant provided that less than 2/3 of the parties are corrupt. Our protocols require that either (1) the functionality is deterministic and the size of the domain is polynomial (in the security parameter), or (2) the functionality can be randomized and the size of the range is polynomial. If the size of the domain is constant and the functionality is deterministic, then our protocol is efficient even when the number of parties is O(log log n) (where n is the security parameter). On the negative side, we show that when the number of parties is super-constant, 1/p-secure protocols are not possible when the size of the domain is polynomial.',

	{'abstract': u"We consider the problem of performing a random walk in a distributed network. Given bandwidth constraints, the goal of the problem is to minimize the number of rounds required to obtain a random walk sample. Das Sarma et al. [PODC'10] show that a random walk of length on a network of diameter can be performed in time. A major question left open is whether there exists a faster algorithm, especially whether the multiplication of and is necessary. In this paper, we show a tight unconditional lower bound on the time complexity of distributed random walk computation. Specifically, we show that for any , , and , performing a random walk of length on an -node network of diameter requires time. This bound is , i.e., it holds for any (possibly randomized) algorithm. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first lower bound that the diameter plays a role of multiplicative factor. Our bound shows that the algorithm of Das Sarma et al. is time optimal. Our proof technique introduces a new connection between communication complexity and distributed algorithm lower bounds with as a trade-off parameter, strengthening the previous study by Das Sarma et al.

	{'abstract': u'Interference is emerging as a fundamental bottleneck in many important wireless communication scenarios, including dense cellular networks and cognitive networks with spectrum sharing by multiple service providers. Although multipleantenna (MIMO) signal processing is known to offer useful degrees of freedom to cancel interference, extreme-value theoretic analysis recently showed that, even in the absence of MIMO processing, the scaling law of the capacity in the number of users for a multi-cell network with and without inter-cell interference was asymptotically identical provided a simple signal to noise and interference ratio (SINR) maximizing scheduler is exploited. This suggests that scheduling can help reduce inter-cell interference substantially, thus possibly limiting the need for multiple-antenna processing. However, the convergence limits of interference after scheduling in a multi-cell setting are not yet identified. In this paper1 we analyze such limits theoretically. We consider channel statistics under Rayleigh fading with equal path loss for all users or with unequal path loss. We uncover two surprisingly different behaviors for such systems. For the equal path loss case, we show that scheduling alone can cause the residual interference to converge to zero for large number of users. With unequal path loss however, the interference are shown to converge in average to a nonzero constant. Simulations back our findings.',

	{'abstract': u'We define the notion of affine rigidity of a hypergraph and prove a variety of fundamental results for this notion. First, we show that affine rigidity can be determined by the rank of a specific matrix which implies that affine rigidity is a generic property of the hypergraph.Then we prove that if a graph is is -vertex-connected, then it must be "generically neighborhood affinely rigid" in -dimensional space. This implies that if a graph is -vertex-connected then any generic framework of its squared graph must be universally rigid. Our results, and affine rigidity more generally, have natural applications in point registration and localization, as well as connections to manifold learning.',

	{'abstract': u"We present new and improved data structures that answer exact node-to-node distance queries in planar graphs. Such data structures are also known as distance oracles. For any directed planar graph on n nodes with non-negative lengths we obtain the following: * Given a desired space allocation , we show how to construct in time a data structure of size that answers distance queries in time per query. As a consequence, we obtain an improvement over the fastest algorithm for k-many distances in planar graphs whenever . * We provide a linear-space exact distance oracle for planar graphs with query time for any constant eps&gt;0. This is the first such data structure with provable sublinear query time. * For edge lengths at least one, we provide an exact distance oracle of space such that for any pair of nodes at distance D the query time is . Comparable query performance had been observed experimentally but has never been explained theoretically. Our data structures are based on the following new tool: given a non-self-crossing cycle C with nodes, we can preprocess G in time to produce a data structure of size that can answer the following queries in time: for a query node u, output the distance from u to all the nodes of C. This data structure builds on and extends a related data structure of Klein (SODA'05), which reports distances to the boundary of a face, rather than a cycle. The best distance oracles for planar graphs until the current work are due to Cabello (SODA'06), Djidjev (WG'96), and Fakcharoenphol and Rao (FOCS'01).

	{'abstract': u'In this paper, we give a theoretical analysis for the algorithms to compute functional decomposition for multivariate polynomials based on differentiation and homogenization which are proposed by Ye, Dai, Lam (1999) and Faugere, Perret (2006, 2008, 2009). We show that a degree proper functional decomposition for a set of randomly decomposable quartic homogenous polynomials can be computed using the algorithm with high probability. This solves a conjecture proposed by Ye, Dai, and Lam (1999). We also propose a conjecture such that the decomposition for a set of polynomials can be computed from that of its homogenization with high probability. Finally, we prove that the right decomposition factors for a set of polynomials can be computed from its right decomposition factor space. Combining these results together, we prove that the algorithm can compute a degree proper decomposition for a set of randomly decomposable quartic polynomials with probability one when the base field is of characteristic zero, and with probability close to one when the base field is a finite field with sufficiently large number under the assumption that the conjeture is correct.',

	{'abstract': u'Sampling rate is the bottleneck for spectrum sensing over multi-GHz bandwidth. Recent progress in compressed sensing (CS) initialized several sub-Nyquist rate approaches to overcome the problem. However, efforts to design CS reconstruction algorithms for wideband spectrum sensing are very limited. It is possible to further reduce the sampling rate requirement and improve reconstruction performance via algorithms considering prior knowledge of cognitive radio spectrum usages. In this paper, we group the usages of cognitive radio spectrum into three categories and propose a modified orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) algorithm for wideband spectrum sensing. Simulation results show that this modified OMP algorithm outperforms two modified basis pursuit de-noising (BPDN) algorithms in terms of reconstruction performance and computation time.',

	{'abstract': u'In this paper we study stochastic dynamic games with many players; these are a fundamental model for a wide range of economic applications. The standard solution concept for such games is Markov perfect equilibrium (MPE), but it is well known that MPE computation becomes intractable as the number of players increases. We instead consider the notion of stationary equilibrium (SE), where players optimize assuming the empirical distribution of others\' states remains constant at its long run average. We make two main contributions. First, we provide a rigorous justification for using SE. In particular, we provide a parsimonious collection of exogenous conditions over model primitives that guarantee existence of SE, and ensure that an appropriate approximation property to MPE holds, in a general model with possibly unbounded state spaces. Second, we draw a significant connection between the validity of SE, and market structure: under the same conditions that imply SE exist and approximates MPE well, the market becomes fragmented in the limit of many firms. To illustrate this connection, we study in detail a series of dynamic oligopoly examples. These examples show that our conditions enforce a form of "decreasing returns to larger states"; this yields fragmented industries in the limit. By contrast, violation of these conditions suggests "increasing returns to larger states" and potential market concentration. In that sense, our work uses a fully dynamic framework to also contribute to a longstanding issue in industrial organization: understanding the determinants of market structure in different industries.',

	{'abstract': u'We report new results on the complexity of the valued constraint satisfaction problem (VCSP). Under the unique games conjecture, the approximability of finite-valued VCSP is fairly well-understood. However, there is yet no characterisation of VCSPs that can be solved exactly in polynomial time. This is unsatisfactory, since such results are interesting from a combinatorial optimisation perspective; there are deep connections with, for instance, submodular and bisubmodular minimisation. We consider the Min and Max CSP problems (i.e. where the cost functions only attain values in ) over four-element domains and identify all tractable fragments. Similar classifications were previously known for two- and three-element domains. In the process, we introduce a new class of tractable VCSPs based on a generalisation of submodularity. We also extend and modify a graph-based technique by Kolmogorov and Zivny (originally introduced by Takhanov) for efficiently obtaining hardness results in our setting. This allow us to prove the result without relying on computer-assisted case analyses (which otherwise are fairly common when studying the complexity and approximability of VCSPs.) The hardness results are further simplified by the introduction of powerful reduction techniques.',

The capacity region is shown to be strictly larger in general than the achievable rate regions when treating interference as noise, using successive interference cancellation decoding, and using joint decoding. The gains in coverage and achievable rate using the optimal decoder are analyzed in terms of ensemble averages using stochastic geometry. In a spatial network where the nodes are distributed according to a Poisson point process and the channel path loss exponent is , it is shown that the density of users that can be supported by treating interference as noise can scale no faster than as the bandwidth grows, while the density of users can scale linearly with under optimal decoding.',

A processing grid network is proposed to underlie not just matter and energy, but also space and time. The suggested "screen" for our familiar three dimensional world is a hyper-sphere surface simulated by a grid network. Light and matter then travel, or are transmitted, in the "directions" of the grid architecture. The processing sequences of grid nodes create time, as the static states of movies run together emulate events. Yet here what exists are not the static states, but the dynamic processing between them. Quantum collapse is the irreversible event that gives time its direction. In this model, empty space is null processing, directions are node links, time is processing cycles, light is a processing wave, objects are wave tangles and energy is the processing transfer rate. It describes a world where empty space is not empty, space warps, time dilates, and everything began when this virtual universe "booted up".',

	{'abstract': u'We consider spatially coupled code ensembles over a multiple access channel. Convolutional LDPC ensembles are one instance of spatially coupled codes. It was shown recently that, for transmission over the binary erasure channel, this coupling of individual code ensembles has the effect of increasing the belief propagation threshold of the coupled ensembles to the maximum a-posteriori threshold of the underlying ensemble. In this sense, spatially coupled codes were shown to be capacity achieving. It was observed, empirically, that these codes are universal in the sense that they achieve performance close to the Shannon threshold for any general binary-input memoryless symmetric channels. In this work we provide further evidence of the threshold saturation phenomena when transmitting over a class of multiple access channel. We show, by density evolution analysis and EXIT curves, that the belief propagation threshold of the coupled ensembles is very close to the ultimate Shannon limit.',

	{'abstract': u'In this paper, we consider different aspects of the network functional compression problem where computation of a function (or, some functions) of sources located at certain nodes in a network is desired at receiver(s). The rate region of this problem has been considered in the literature under certain restrictive assumptions, particularly in terms of the network topology, the functions and the characteristics of the sources. In this paper, we present results that significantly relax these assumptions. Firstly, we consider this problem for an arbitrary tree network and asymptotically lossless computation. We show that, for depth one trees with correlated sources, or for general trees with independent sources, a modularized coding scheme based on graph colorings and Slepian-Wolf compression performs arbitrarily closely to rate lower bounds. For a general tree network with independent sources, optimal computation to be performed at intermediate nodes is derived. We introduce a necessary and sufficient condition on graph colorings of any achievable coding scheme, called coloring connectivity condition (C.C.C.). Secondly, we investigate the effect of having several functions at the receiver. In this problem, we derive a rate region and propose a coding scheme based on graph colorings. Thirdly, we consider the functional compression problem with feedback. We show that, in this problem, unlike Slepian-Wolf compression, by having feedback, one may outperform rate bounds of the case without feedback. Fourthly, we investigate functional computation problem with distortion. We compute a rate-distortion region for this problem. Then, we propose a simple suboptimal coding scheme with a non-trivial performance guarantee. Finally, we introduce cases where finding minimum entropy colorings and therefore, optimal coding schemes can be performed in polynomial time.',

	{'abstract': u'Spectrum sensing is the major challenge in the cognitive radio (CR). We propose to learn local feature and use it as the prior knowledge to improve the detection performance. We define the local feature as the leading eigenvector derived from the received signal samples. A feature learning algorithm (FLA) is proposed to learn the feature blindly. Then, with local feature as the prior knowledge, we propose the feature template matching algorithm (FTM) for spectrum sensing. We use the discrete Karhunen--Love transform (DKLT) to show that such a feature is robust against noise and has maximum effective signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Captured real-world data shows that the learned feature is very stable over time. It is almost unchanged in 25 seconds. Then, we test the detection performance of the FTM in very low SNR. Simulation results show that the FTM is about 2 dB better than the blind algorithms, and the FTM does not have the noise uncertainty problem.',

	{'abstract': u'Optimum implementation of non-conventional wells allows us to increase considerably hydrocarbon recovery. By considering the high drilling cost and the potential improvement in well productivity, well placement decision is an important issue in field development. Considering complex reservoir geology and high reservoir heterogeneities, stochastic optimization methods are the most suitable approaches for optimum well placement. This paper proposes an optimization methodology to determine optimal well location and trajectory based upon the Covariance Matrix Adaptation - Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES) which is a variant of Evolution Strategies recognized as one of the most powerful derivative-free optimizers for continuous optimization. To improve the optimization procedure, two new techniques are investigated: (1). Adaptive penalization with rejection is developed to handle well placement constraints. (2). A meta-model, based on locally weighted regression, is incorporated into CMA-ES using an approximate ranking procedure. Therefore, we can reduce the number of reservoir simulations, which are computationally expensive. Several examples are presented. Our new approach is compared with a Genetic Algorithm incorporating the Genocop III technique. It is shown that our approach outperforms the genetic algorithm: it leads in general to both a higher NPV and a significant reduction of the number of reservoir simulations.',

	{'abstract': u'The problem of universally predicting an individual continuous sequence using a deterministic finite-state machine (FSM) is considered. The empirical mean is used as a reference as it is the constant that fits a given sequence within a minimal square error. With this reference, a reasonable prediction performance is the regret, namely the excess square-error over the reference loss, the empirical variance. The paper analyzes the tradeoff between the number of states of the universal FSM and the attainable regret. It first studies the case of a small number of states. A class of machines, denoted Degenerated Tracking Memory (DTM), is defined and the optimal machine in this class is shown to be the optimal among all machines for small enough number of states. Unfortunately, DTM machines become suboptimal as the number of available states increases. Next, the Exponential Decaying Memory (EDM) machine, previously used for predicting binary sequences, is considered. While this machine has poorer performance for small number of states, it achieves a vanishing regret for large number of states. Following that, an asymptotic lower bound of O(k^) on the achievable regret of any k-state machine is derived. This bound is attained asymptotically by the EDM machine. Furthermore, a new machine, denoted the Enhanced Exponential Decaying Memory machine, is shown to outperform the EDM machine for any number of states.',

It describes the properties of linguistic networks built using texts of written language with the words randomized. These properties are compared to those obtained for a network built over the text in natural order. It is observed that the "random" networks too exhibit small-world and scale-free characteristics. They also show a high degree of clustering. This is indeed a surprising result - one that has not been addressed adequately in the literature. We hypothesize that many of the network statistics reported here studied are in fact functions of the distribution of the underlying data from which the network is built and may not be indicative of the nature of the concerned network.',

	{'abstract': u'The question of what can be computed, and how efficiently, are at the core of computer science. Not surprisingly, in distributed systems and networking research, an equally fundamental question is what can be computed in a distributed fashion. More precisely, if nodes of a network must base their decision on information in their local neighborhood only, how well can they compute or approximate a global (optimization) problem? In this paper we give the first substantial lower bound on such local computation for (optimization) problems including minimum vertex cover, minimum (connected) dominating set, maximum matching, maximal independent set, and maximal matching. In addition we present a new distributed algorithm for solving general covering and packing linear programs. For some problems this algorithm is tight with the lower bounds, for others it is a distributed approximation scheme. Together, our lower and upper bounds establish the local computability and approximability of a large class of problems, characterizing how much local information is required to solve these tasks.',

	{'abstract': u'We present a multi-channel P2P Video-on-Demand (VoD) system using "plug-and-play" helpers. Helpers are heterogenous "micro-servers" with limited storage, bandwidth and number of users they can serve simultaneously. Our proposed system has the following salient features: (1) it minimizes the server load; (2) it is distributed, and requires little or no maintenance overhead and which can easily adapt to system dynamics; and (3) it is adaptable to varying supply and demand patterns across multiple video channels irrespective of video popularity. Our proposed solution jointly optimizes over helper-user topology, video storage allocation and bandwidth allocation. The combinatorial nature of the problem and the system demand for distributed algorithms makes the problem uniquely challenging. By utilizing Lagrangian decomposition and Markov chain approximation based arguments, we address this challenge by designing two distributed algorithms running in tandem: a primal-dual storage and bandwidth allocation algorithm and a "soft-worst-neighbor-choking" topology-building algorithm. Our scheme provably converges to a near-optimal solution, and is easy to implement in practice. Simulation results validate that the proposed scheme achieves minimum sever load under highly heterogeneous combinations of supply and demand patterns, and is robust to system dynamics of user/helper churn, user/helper asynchrony, and random delays in the network.',

	{'abstract': u'Ordinal regression is commonly formulated as a multi-class problem with ordinal constraints. The challenge of designing accurate classifiers for ordinal regression generally increases with the number of classes involved, due to the large number of labeled patterns that are needed. The availability of ordinal class labels, however, is often costly to calibrate or difficult to obtain. Unlabeled patterns, on the other hand, often exist in much greater abundance and are freely available. To take benefits from the abundance of unlabeled patterns, we present a novel transductive learning paradigm for ordinal regression in this paper, namely Transductive Ordinal Regression (TOR). The key challenge of the present study lies in the precise estimation of both the ordinal class label of the unlabeled data and the decision functions of the ordinal classes, simultaneously. The core elements of the proposed TOR include an objective function that caters to several commonly used loss functions casted in transductive settings, for general ordinal regression. A label swapping scheme that facilitates a strictly monotonic decrease in the objective function value is also introduced. Extensive numerical studies on commonly used benchmark datasets including the real world sentiment prediction problem are then presented to showcase the characteristics and efficacies of the proposed transductive ordinal regression. Further, comparisons to recent state-of-the-art ordinal regression methods demonstrate the introduced transductive learning paradigm for ordinal regression led to the robust and improved performance.',

	{'abstract': u'We present an empirical study of user activity in online BBC discussion forums, measured by the number of posts written by individual debaters and the average sentiment of these posts. Nearly 2.5 million posts from over 18 thousand users were investigated. Scale free distributions were observed for activity in individual discussion threads as well as for overall activity. The number of unique users in a thread normalized by the thread length decays with thread length, suggesting that thread life is sustained by mutual discussions rather than by independent comments. Automatic sentiment analysis shows that most posts contain negative emotions and the most active users in individual threads express predominantly negative sentiments. It follows that the average emotion of longer threads is more negative and that threads can be sustained by negative comments. An agent based computer simulation model has been used to reproduce several essential characteristics of the analyzed system. The model stresses the role of discussions between users, especially emotionally laden quarrels between supporters of opposite opinions, and represents many observed statistics of the forum.',

We add a redundancy to the original image by mapping the transform coefficients with small amplitudes to zero and the resultant sparsity pattern is used as the side information in the recovery stage. If the side information is not available, the receiver has to estimate the sparsity pattern. At the end, the recovery is done by consecutive projecting between two spatial and transform sets.

	{'abstract': u'Security aspects of the Index Coding with Side Information (ICSI) problem are investigated. Building on the results of Bar-Yossef et al. (2006), the properties of linear index codes are further explored. The notion of weak security, considered by Bhattad and Narayanan (2005) in the context of network coding, is generalized to block security. It is shown that the linear index code based on a matrix , whose column space code has length , minimum distance and dual distance , is -block secure (and hence also weakly secure) if the adversary knows in advance messages, and is completely insecure if the adversary knows in advance more than messages. Strong security is examined under the conditions that the adversary: (i) possesses messages in advance; (ii) eavesdrops at most transmissions; (iii) corrupts at most transmissions. We prove that for sufficiently large , an optimal linear index code which is strongly secure against such an adversary has length . Here is a generalization of the min-rank over of the side information graph for the ICSI problem in its original formulation in the work of Bar- Yossef et al.',

	{'abstract': u'We analyze the effect of interference on the convergence rate of average consensus algorithms, which iteratively compute the measurement average by message passing among nodes. It is usually assumed that these algorithms converge faster with a greater exchange of information (i.e., by increased network connectivity) in every iteration. However, when interference is taken into account, it is no longer clear if the rate of convergence increases with network connectivity. We study this problem for randomly-placed consensus-seeking nodes connected through an interference-limited network. We investigate the following questions: (a) How does the rate of convergence vary with increasing communication range of each node? and (b) How does this result change when each node is allowed to communicate with a few selected far-off nodes? When nodes schedule their transmissions to avoid interference, we show that the convergence speed scales with , where is the communication range and is the number of dimensions. This scaling is the result of two competing effects when increasing : Increased schedule length for interference-free transmission vs. the speed gain due to improved connectivity. Hence, although one-dimensional networks can converge faster from a greater communication range despite increased interference, the two effects exactly offset one another in two-dimensions. In higher dimensions, increasing the communication range can actually degrade the rate of convergence. Our results thus underline the importance of factoring in the effect of interference in the design of distributed estimation algorithms.',

Comparing to the approximations by fuzzy system and radial-based-function (RBF) neural networks, the presented two methods can not only approximate universally the uncertainties, but also estimate the unknown states. Moreover, the integral-chain differentiator can restrain noises thoroughly. The theoretical results are confirmed by computer simulations for feedback control.',

	{'abstract': u'We consider the localization problem of multiple wideband sources in a multi-path environment by coherently taking into account the attenuation characteristics and the time delays in the reception of the signal. Our proposed method leaves the space for unavailability of an accurate signal attenuation model in the environment by considering the model as an unknown function with reasonable prior assumptions about its functional space. Such approach is capable of enhancing the localization performance compared to only utilizing the signal attenuation information or the time delays. In this paper, the localization problem is modeled as a cost function in terms of the source locations, attenuation model parameters and the multi-path parameters. To globally perform the minimization, we propose a hybrid algorithm combining the differential evolution algorithm with the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm. Besides the proposed combination of optimization schemes, supporting the technical details such as closed forms of cost function sensitivity matrices are provided. Finally, the validity of the proposed method is examined in several localization scenarios, taking into account the noise in the environment, the multi-path phenomenon and considering the sensors not being synchronized.',

This type of synchronisation may occur when people need only some awareness about the location of others within the specific context of an on-going activity. We have identified a number of reference scenarios for this type of synchronisation and we have implemented and deployed a prototype to evaluate the type of support provided. The results of the evaluation suggest a good acceptance of the overall concept, indicating that this might be a valuable approach for many of the indicated scenarios, possibly replacing or complementing existing synchronisation practices.',

	{'abstract': u"Algebraic independence is an advanced notion in commutative algebra that generalizes independence of linear polynomials to higher degree. Polynomials subset F[x_1, ..., x_n] are called algebraically independent if there is no non-zero polynomial F such that F(f_1, ..., f_m) = 0. The transcendence degree, trdeg, is the maximal number r of algebraically independent polynomials in the set. In this paper we design blackbox and efficient linear maps phi that reduce the number of variables from n to r but maintain trdeg_i = r, assuming f_i's sparse and small r. We apply these fundamental maps to solve several cases of blackbox identity testing: (1) Given a polynomial-degree circuit C and sparse polynomials f_1, ..., f_m with trdeg r, we can test blackbox D := C(f_1, ..., f_m) for zeroness in poly(size(D))^r time. (2) Define a spsp_ delta(k,s,n) circuit C to be of the form sum_^k prod_^s f_, where f_ are sparse n-variate polynomials of degree at most delta. For k = 2 we give a poly(sn delta)^ time blackbox identity test. (3) For a general depth-4 circuit we define a notion of rank. Assuming there is a rank bound R for minimal simple spsp_ delta(k,s,n) identities, we give a poly(snR delta)^ time blackbox identity test for spsp_ delta(k,s,n) circuits. This partially generalizes the state of the art of depth-3 to depth-4 circuits. The notion of trdeg works best with large or zero characteristic, but we also give versions of our results for arbitrary fields.",

	{'abstract': u'We continue the line of research on graph compression started with WebGraph, but we move our focus to the compression of social networks in a proper sense (e.g., LiveJournal): the approaches that have been used for a long time to compress web graphs rely on a specific ordering of the nodes (lexicographical URL ordering) whose extension to general social networks is not trivial. In this paper, we propose a solution that mixes clusterings and orders, and devise a new algorithm, called Layered Label Propagation, that builds on previous work on scalable clustering and can be used to reorder very large graphs (billions of nodes). Our implementation uses overdecomposition to perform aggressively on multi-core architecture, making it possible to reorder graphs of more than 600 millions nodes in a few hours. Experiments performed on a wide array of web graphs and social networks show that combining the order produced by the proposed algorithm with the WebGraph compression framework provides a major increase in compression with respect to all currently known techniques, both on web graphs and on social networks. These improvements make it possible to analyse in main memory significantly larger graphs.',

	{'abstract': u"A network where three users communicate with each other via a relay is considered. Users do not receive other users' signals via a direct link, and thus the relay is essential for their communication. Each user is assumed to have an individual message to be delivered to each other user. Thus, each user wants to send two messages and to decode two messages. In general, the transmit signals of different nodes can be dependent since they can depend on previously received symbols. We call this case the general case. The sum-capacity is studied, and upper bounds and lower bounds are given. If all nodes have the same power, the sum-capacity is characterized to within a gap of 5/2 bits or a factor of 3 for all values of channel coefficients. This gap is also shown to approach 3/2 bits as the transmit power increases. Moreover, for the symmetric case with equal channel coefficients, the gap is shown to be less than 1 bit. The restricted case is also considered where the transmit signal does not depend on previously received symbols. In this case, the sum-capacity is characterized to within a gap of 2 bits or a factor of 3 for all values of channel coefficients, and approaches 1 bit as the transmit power increases.",

	{'abstract': u"In this paper, we present and analyze the properties of a new class of games - the spatial congestion game (SCG), which is a generalization of the classical congestion game (CG). In a classical congestion game, multiple users share the same set of resources and a user's payoff for using any resource is a function of the total number of users sharing it. As a potential game, this game enjoys some very appealing properties, including the existence of a pure strategy Nash equilibrium (NE) and that every improvement path is finite and leads to such a NE (also called the finite improvement property or FIP). While it's tempting to use this model to study spectrum sharing, it does not capture the spatial reuse feature of wireless communication, where resources (interpreted as channels) may be reused without increasing congestion provided that users are located far away from each other. This motivates us to study an extended form of the congestion game where a user's payoff for using a resource is a function of the number of its interfering users sharing it. This naturally results in a spatial congestion game (SCG), where users are placed over a network (or a conflict graph). We study fundamental properties of a spatial congestion game; in particular, we seek to answer under what conditions this game possesses the finite improvement property or a Nash equilibrium. We also discuss the implications of these results when applied to wireless spectrum sharing.",

A polynomial time algorithm for the isomorphism problem for regular linear orders (and even regular words, which generalize the latter) given by DFAs is presented. This solves an open problem by Esik and Bloom.',

	{'abstract': u'Modern Avionics are controlled by sophisticated mission components in the Aircraft. The control function is implemented via a standard ARINC-429 bus interface. It is a two-wire point-topoint serial data bus for control communications in Avionics. The bus operates 12.5 or 100kb/sec, the implementation is envisaged for one transmits and receive channel respectively. Further the code can be modified for more no of independent Tx and Rx channels. An on chip memory allotment on the FPGA will provide a buffer bank for storing the incoming or outgoing data. For this purpose SRAM based FPGAs are utilized. This flexible ARINC429 solution gives exactly what is needed for real time applications. The IP can be programmed to send an interrupt to the host and also prepare it to process the data. Majority of the hardware function of digital natures are embedded into a single FPGA by saving in terms of PCB board space, power consumption and volume results. This paper deals with the development, implementation, simulation, and verification of ARINC_429 formats. The IP core development is described in VHDL.',

	{'abstract': u'In this paper, we study the achievable rate region of Gaussian multiuser channels with the messages transmitted being from finite input alphabets and the outputs being . In particular, we focus on the achievable rate region of Gaussian broadcast channel (GBC) and Gaussian multiple access channel (GMAC). First, we study the achievable rate region of two-user GBC when the messages to be transmitted to both the users take values from finite signal sets and the received signal is quantized at both the users. We refer to this channel as . We observe that the capacity region defined for a GBC does not carry over as such to QBC. We show that the optimal decoding scheme for GBC (i.e., high SNR user doing successive decoding and low SNR user decoding its message alone) is not optimal for QBC. We then propose an achievable rate region for QBC based on two different schemes. We present achievable rate region results for the case of uniform quantization at the receivers. Next, we investigate the achievable rate region of two-user GMAC with finite input alphabet and quantized receiver output. We refer to this channel as . We derive expressions for the achievable rate region of a two-user QMAC. We show that, with finite input alphabet, the achievable rate region with the commonly used uniform receiver quantizer has a significant loss compared to the achievable rate region without receiver quantization. We propose a which has a significantly larger rate region compared to what is achieved with a uniform quantizer in QMAC.',

	{'abstract': u'Bit-interleaved coded modulation (BICM) using (bi-)orthogonal signals is especially well suited for the application in impulse-radio ultra-wideband transmission systems, which typically operate in the power-limited regime and require a very low-complexity transmitter and receiver design. In this paper we analyze the capacity of BICM using (bi-)orthogonal signals with coherent and noncoherent detection and put particular focus on the power-limited or wideband regime. We give analytical expressions for the ratio energy per bit vs. noise power spectral density in the limit of infinite bandwidth and the respective wideband slope, and thus, are able to quantify the loss incurred by the restriction to BICM in contrast to coded modulation. The gained theoretical insights allow to derive design rules for impulse-radio ultra-wideband transmission systems.',

	{'abstract': u'Graph coloring, also known as vertex coloring, considers the problem of assigning colors to the nodes of a graph such that adjacent nodes do not share the same color. The optimization version of the problem concerns the minimization of the number of used colors. In this paper we deal with the problem of finding valid colorings of graphs in a distributed way, that is, by means of an algorithm that only uses local information for deciding the color of the nodes. Such algorithms prescind from any central control. Due to the fact that quite a few practical applications require to find colorings in a distributed way, the interest in distributed algorithms for graph coloring has been growing during the last decade. As an example consider wireless ad-hoc and sensor networks, where tasks such as the assignment of frequencies or the assignment of TDMA slots are strongly related to graph coloring. The algorithm proposed in this paper is inspired by the calling behavior of Japanese tree frogs. Male frogs use their calls to attract females. Interestingly, groups of males that are located nearby each other desynchronize their calls. This is because female frogs are only able to correctly localize the male frogs when their calls are not too close in time. We experimentally show that our algorithm is very competitive with the current state of the art, using different sets of problem instances and comparing to one of the most competitive algorithms from the literature.',

	{'abstract': u'In this paper, we propose a novel age estimation method based on GLOH feature descriptor and multi-task learning (MTL). The GLOH feature descriptor, one of the state-of-the-art feature descriptor, is used to capture the age-related local and spatial information of face image. As the exacted GLOH features are often redundant, MTL is designed to select the most informative feature bins for age estimation problem, while the corresponding weights are determined by ridge regression. This approach largely reduces the dimensions of feature, which can not only improve performance but also decrease the computational burden. Experiments on the public available FG-NET database show that the proposed method can achieve comparable performance over previous approaches while using much fewer features.',

Commercial involvement has created the initial garbage collector, added several interfaces and two development tools: PlDoc (a literate programming documentation system) and PlUnit (a unit testing environment). In this article we present SWI-Prolog as an integrating tool, supporting a wide range of ideas developed in the Prolog community and acting as glue between textit resources. This article itself is the glue between technical articles on SWI-Prolog, providing context and experience in applying them over a longer period.',

	{'abstract': u'Inspired by biological vision systems, the over-complete local features with huge cardinality are increasingly used for face recognition during the last decades. Accordingly, feature selection has become more and more important and plays a critical role for face data description and recognition. In this paper, we propose a trainable feature selection algorithm based on the regularized frame for face recognition. By enforcing a sparsity penalty term on the minimum squared error (MSE) criterion, we cast the feature selection problem into a combinatorial sparse approximation problem, which can be solved by greedy methods or convex relaxation methods. Moreover, based on the same frame, we propose a sparse Ho-Kashyap (HK) procedure to obtain simultaneously the optimal sparse solution and the corresponding margin vector of the MSE criterion. The proposed methods are used for selecting the most informative Gabor features of face images for recognition and the experimental results on benchmark face databases demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.',

	{'abstract': u"A critical need in Mobile Wireless Sensor Network (MWSN) is to achieve energy efficiency during routing as the sensor nodes have scarce energy resource. The nodes' mobility in MWSN poses a challenge to design an energy efficient routing protocol. Clustering helps to achieve energy efficiency by reducing the organization complexity overhead of the network which is proportional to the number of nodes in the network. This paper proposes a novel hybrid multipath routing algorithm with an efficient clustering technique. A node is selected as cluster head if it has high surplus energy, better transmission range and least mobility. The Energy Aware (EA) selection mechanism and the Maximal Nodal Surplus Energy estimation technique incorporated in this algorithm improves the energy performance during routing. Simulation results can show that the proposed clustering and routing algorithm can scale well in dynamic and energy deficient mobile sensor network.",

We assume that the person specific models share a common subset of features and novelly reformulated the common subset selection problem as a simultaneous sparse approximation problem.

	{'abstract': u'This study is focused on the development of the cortex-like visual object recognition system. We propose a general framework, which consists of three hierarchical levels (modules). These modules functionally correspond to the V1, V4 and IT areas. Both bottom-up and top-down connections between the hierarchical levels V4 and IT are employed. The higher the degree of matching between the input and the preferred stimulus, the shorter the response time of the neuron. Therefore information about a single stimulus is distributed in time and is transmitted by the waves of spikes. The reciprocal connections and waves of spikes implement predictive coding: an initial hypothesis is generated on the basis of information delivered by the first wave of spikes and is tested with the information carried by the consecutive waves. The development is considered as extraction and accumulation of features in V4 and objects in IT. Once stored a feature can be disposed, if rarely activated. This cause update of feature repository. Consequently, objects in IT are also updated. This illustrates the growing process and dynamical change of topological structures of V4, IT and connections between these areas.',

	{'abstract': u'The constraint complexity of a graphical realization of a linear code is the maximum dimension of the local constraint codes in the realization. The treewidth of a linear code is the least constraint complexity of any of its cycle-free graphical realizations. This notion provides a useful parametrization of the maximum-likelihood decoding complexity for linear codes. In this paper, we prove the surprising fact that for maximum distance separable codes and Reed-Muller codes, treewidth equals trelliswidth, which, for a code, is defined to be the least constraint complexity (or branch complexity) of any of its trellis realizations. From this, we obtain exact expressions for the treewidth of these codes, which constitute the only known explicit expressions for the treewidth of algebraic codes.',

	{'abstract': u'We analyze the performance of CSMA in multi-channel wireless networks, accounting for the random nature of traffic. Specifically, we assess the ability of CSMA to fully utilize the radio resources and in turn to stabilize the network in a dynamic setting with flow arrivals and departures. We prove that CSMA is optimal in ad-hoc mode but not in infrastructure mode, when all data flows originate from or are destined to some access points, due to the inherent bias of CSMA against downlink traffic. We propose a slight modification of CSMA, that we refer to as flow-aware CSMA, which corrects this bias and makes the algorithm optimal in all cases. The analysis is based on some time-scale separation assumption which is proved valid in the limit of large flow sizes.',

	{'abstract': u'We show that the optimal decision policy for several types of Bayesian sequential detection problems has a threshold switching curve structure on the space of posterior distributions. This is established by using lattice programming and stochastic orders in a partially observed Markov decision process (POMDP) framework. A stochastic gradient algorithm is presented to estimate the optimal linear approximation to this threshold curve. We illustrate these results by first considering quickest time detection with phase-type distributed change time and a variance stopping penalty. Then it is proved that the threshold switching curve also arises in several other Bayesian decision problems such as quickest transient detection, exponential delay (risk-sensitive) penalties, stopping time problems in social learning, and multi-agent scheduling in a changing world. Using Blackwell dominance, it is shown that for dynamic decision making problems, the optimal decision policy is lower bounded by a myopic policy. Finally, it is shown how the achievable cost of the optimal decision policy varies with change time distribution by imposing a partial order on transition matrices.',

	{'abstract': u'This paper addresses the problem of blind separation of convolutive mixtures of BPSK and circular linearly modulated signals with unknown (and possibly different) baud rates and carrier frequencies. In previous works, we established that the Constant Modulus Algorithm (CMA) is able to extract a source from a convolutive mixture of circular linearly modulated signals. We extend the analysis of the extraction capabilities of the CMA when the mixing also contains BPSK signals. We prove that if the various source signals do not share any non zero cyclic frequency nor any non conjugate cyclic frequencies, the local minima of the constant modulus cost function are separating filters. Unfortunately, the minimization of the Godard cost function generally fails when considering BPSK signals that have the same rates and the same carrier frequencies. This failure is due to the existence of non-separating local minima of the Godard cost function. In order to achieve the separation, we propose a simple modification of the Godard cost function which only requires knowledge of the BPSK sources frequency offsets at the receiver side. We provide various simulations of realistic digital communications scenarios that support our theoretical statements.',

	{'abstract': u'Secure distance bounding (DB) protocols allow one entity, the verifier, to securely obtain an upper-bound on the distance to another entity, the prover. Thus far, DB was considered mostly in the context of a single prover and a single verifier. There has been no substantial prior work on secure DB in group settings, where a set of provers interact with a set of verifiers. The need for group distance bounding (GDB) is motivated by many practical scenarios, including: group device pairing, location-based access control and secure distributed localization. GDB is also useful in mission-critical networks and automotive computer systems. This paper addresses, for the first time, GDB protocols by utilizing the new passive DB primitive and the novel mutual multi-party GDB protocol. We show how they can be used to construct secure and efficient GDB protocols for various settings. We analyze security and performance of our protocols and compare them with existing DB techniques when applied to group settings.',

	{'abstract': u"Codes over permutations under the infinity norm have been recently suggested as a coding scheme for correcting limited-magnitude errors in the rank modulation scheme. Given such a code, we show that a simple relabeling operation, which produces an isomorphic code, may drastically change the minimal distance of the code. Thus, we may choose a code structure for efficient encoding/decoding procedures, and then optimize the code's minimal distance via relabeling. We formally define the relabeling problem, and show that all codes may be relabeled to get a minimal distance at most 2. The decision problem of whether a code may be relabeled to distance 1 is shown to be NP-complete, and calculating the best achievable minimal distance after relabeling is proved hard to approximate. Finally, we consider general bounds on the relabeling problem. We specifically show the optimal relabeling distance of cyclic groups. A specific case of a general probabilistic argument is used to show may be relabeled to a minimal distance of .",

	{'abstract': u'We examine the problem of allocating a given total storage budget in a distributed storage system for maximum reliability. A source has a single data object that is to be coded and stored over a set of storage nodes; it is allowed to store any amount of coded data in each node, as long as the total amount of storage used does not exceed the given budget. A data collector subsequently attempts to recover the original data object by accessing only the data stored in a random subset of the nodes. By using an appropriate code, successful recovery can be achieved whenever the total amount of data accessed is at least the size of the original data object. The goal is to find an optimal storage allocation that maximizes the probability of successful recovery. This optimization problem is challenging in general because of its combinatorial nature, despite its simple formulation. We study several variations of the problem, assuming different allocation models and access models. The optimal allocation and the optimal symmetric allocation (in which all nonempty nodes store the same amount of data) are determined for a variety of cases. Our results indicate that the optimal allocations often have nonintuitive structure and are difficult to specify. We also show that depending on the circumstances, coding may or may not be beneficial for reliable storage.',

	{'abstract': u'This paper investigates reliable and covert transmission strategies in a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) wiretap channel with a transmitter, receiver and an adversarial wiretapper, each equipped with multiple antennas. In a departure from existing work, the wiretapper possesses a novel capability to act either as a passive eavesdropper or as an active jammer, under a half-duplex constraint. The transmitter therefore faces a choice between allocating all of its power for data, or broadcasting artificial interference along with the information signal in an attempt to jam the eavesdropper (assuming its instantaneous channel state is unknown). To examine the resulting trade-offs for the legitimate transmitter and the adversary, we model their interactions as a two-person zero-sum game with the ergodic MIMO secrecy rate as the payoff function. We first examine conditions for the existence of pure-strategy Nash equilibria (NE) and the structure of mixed-strategy NE for the strategic form of the game.We then derive equilibrium strategies for the extensive form of the game where players move sequentially under scenarios of perfect and imperfect information. Finally, numerical simulations are presented to examine the equilibrium outcomes of the various scenarios considered.',

	{'abstract': u'Consider the set of source distributions within a fixed maximum relative entropy with respect to a given nominal distribution. Lossless source coding over this relative entropy ball can be approached in more than one way. A problem previously considered is finding a minimax average length source code. The minimizing players are the codeword lengths --- real numbers for arithmetic codes, integers for prefix codes --- while the maximizing players are the uncertain source distributions. Another traditional minimizing objective is the first one considered here, maximum (average) redundancy. This problem reduces to an extension of an exponential Huffman objective treated in the literature but heretofore without direct practical application. In addition to these, this paper examines the related problem of maximal minimax pointwise redundancy and the problem considered by Gawrychowski and Gagie, which, for a sufficiently small relative entropy ball, is equivalent to minimax redundancy. One can consider both Shannon-like coding based on optimal real number ("ideal") codeword lengths and a Huffman-like optimal prefix coding.',

	{'abstract': u'In compressive sensing, a small collection of linear projections of a sparse signal contains enough information to permit signal recovery. Distributed compressive sensing (DCS) extends this framework by defining ensemble sparsity models, allowing a correlated ensemble of sparse signals to be jointly recovered from a collection of separately acquired compressive measurements. In this paper, we introduce a framework for modeling sparse signal ensembles that quantifies the intra- and inter-signal dependencies within and among the signals. This framework is based on a novel bipartite graph representation that links the sparse signal coefficients with the measurements obtained for each signal. Using our framework, we provide fundamental bounds on the number of noiseless measurements that each sensor must collect to ensure that the signals are jointly recoverable.',

	{'abstract': u'We present three voting protocols with unconditional privacy and correctness, without assuming any bound on the number of corrupt participants. All protocols have polynomial complexity and require private channels and a simultaneous broadcast channel. Unlike previously proposed protocols in this model, the protocols that we present deterministically output the exact tally. Our first protocol is a basic voting scheme which allows voters to interact in order to compute the tally. Privacy of the ballot is unconditional in the sense that regardless of the behavior of the dishonest participants nothing can be learned through the protocol that could not be learned in an ideal realisation. Unfortunately, a single dishonest participant can make the protocol abort, in which case the dishonest participants can nevertheless learn the outcome of the tally. Our second protocol introduces voting authorities which improves the communication complexity by limiting interaction to be only between voters and authorities and among the authorities themselves; the simultaneous broadcast is also limited to the authorities. In the second protocol, as long as a single authority is honest, the privacy is unconditional, however, a single corrupt authority or a single corrupt voter can cause the protocol to abort. Our final protocol provides a safeguard against corrupt voters by enabling a verification technique to allow the authorities to revoke incorrect votes without aborting the protocol. Finally, we discuss the implementation of a simultaneous broadcast channel with the use of temporary computational assumptions, yielding versions of our protocols that achieve everlasting security.',

	{'abstract': u'Airport departure operations constitute an important source of airline delays and passenger frustration. Excessive surface traffic is the cause of increased controller and pilot workload; It is also the source of increased emissions; It worsens traffic safety and often does not yield improved runway throughput. Acknowledging this fact, this paper explores some of the feedback mechanisms by which airport traffic can be optimized in real time according to its current degree of congestion. In particular, it examines the environmnetal benefits that improved surveillance technologies can bring in the context of gate- or spot-release aircraft strategies. It is shown that improvements can lead yield 4% to 6% emission reductions for busy airports like New-York La Guardia or Seattle Tacoma. These benefits come on top of the benefits already obtained by adopting threshold strategies currently under evaluation.',

	{'abstract': u'The analysis of online least squares estimation is at the heart of many stochastic sequential decision making problems. We employ tools from the self-normalized processes to provide a simple and self-contained proof of a tail bound of a vector-valued martingale. We use the bound to construct a new tighter confidence sets for the least squares estimate. We apply the confidence sets to several online decision problems, such as the multi-armed and the linearly parametrized bandit problems. The confidence sets are potentially applicable to other problems such as sleeping bandits, generalized linear bandits, and other linear control problems. We improve the regret bound of the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm of Auer et al. (2002) and show that its regret is with high-probability a problem dependent constant. In the case of linear bandits (Dani et al., 2008), we improve the problem dependent bound in the dimension and number of time steps. Furthermore, as opposed to the previous result, we prove that our bound holds for small sample sizes, and at the same time the worst case bound is improved by a logarithmic factor and the constant is improved.',

	{'abstract': u"For the lambda-calculus with letrec we develop an optimisation, which is based on the contraction of a certain class of 'future' (also: virtual) redexes. In the implementation of functional programming languages it is common practice to perform beta-reductions at compile time whenever possible in order to produce code that requires fewer reductions at run time. This is, however, in principle limited to redexes and created redexes that are 'visible' (in the sense that they can be contracted without the need for unsharing), and cannot generally be extended to redexes that are concealed by sharing constructs such as letrec. In the case of recursion, concealed redexes become visible only after unwindings during evaluation, and then have to be contracted time and again. We observe that in some cases such redexes exhibit a certain form of repetitive behaviour at run time. We describe an analysis for identifying binders that give rise to such repetitive reduction patterns, and eliminate them by a sort of predictive contraction. Thereby these binders are lifted out of recursive positions or eliminated altogether, as a result alleviating the amount of beta-reductions required for each recursive iteration. Both our analysis and simplification are suitable to be integrated into existing compilers for functional programming languages as an additional optimisation phase. With this work we hope to contribute to increasing the efficiency of executing programs written in such languages.",

There are two kinds of reduction: anaphoric and lexical. We show that anaphoric reduction depends on the discourse type (vulgarization, pedagogical, specialized) but is independent of both domain and language; that lexical reduction depends on domain and is more frequent in technical, rapidly evolving domains; and that anaphoric reductions tend to follow full terms rather than precede them. We define the notion of the anaphoric tree of the term and study its properties. Concerning lexical reduction, we attempt to prove statistically that there is a notion of term lifecycle, where the full form is progressively replaced by a lexical reduction. ----- Nous 'etudions par des m 'ethodes statistiques sur des corpus fran cais et italiens, le ph 'enom `ene de r 'eduction des termes complexes dans les langues de sp 'ecialit 'e.

	{'abstract': u"This paper investigates the use of graph rewriting systems as a modelling tool, and advocates the embedding of such systems in an interactive environment. One important application domain is the modelling of biochemical systems, where states are represented by port graphs and the dynamics is driven by rules and strategies. A graph rewriting tool's capability to interactively explore the features of the rewriting system provides useful insights into possible behaviours of the model and its properties. We describe PORGY, a visual and interactive tool we have developed to model complex systems using port graphs and port graph rewrite rules guided by strategies, and to navigate in the derivation history. We demonstrate via examples some functionalities provided by PORGY.",

	{'abstract': u'The context of this paper is the use of formal methods for topology-based geometric modelling. Topology-based geometric modelling deals with objects of various dimensions and shapes. Usually, objects are defined by a graph-based topological data structure and by an embedding that associates each topological element (vertex, edge, face, etc.) with relevant data as their geometric shape (position, curve, surface, etc.) or application dedicated data (e.g. molecule concentration level in a biological context). We propose to define topology-based geometric objects as labelled graphs. The arc labelling defines the topological structure of the object whose topological consistency is then ensured by labelling constraints. Nodes have as many labels as there are different data kinds in the embedding. Labelling constraints ensure then that the embedding is consistent with the topological structure. Thus, topology-based geometric objects constitute a particular subclass of a category of labelled graphs in which nodes have multiple labels.',

	{'abstract': u'The relationship between Term Graph Rewriting and Term Rewriting is well understood: a single term graph reduction may correspond to several term reductions, due to sharing. It is also known that if term graphs are allowed to contain cycles, then one term graph reduction may correspond to infinitely many term reductions. We stress that this fact can be interpreted in two ways. According to the "sequential interpretation", a term graph reduction corresponds to an infinite sequence of term reductions, as formalized by Kennaway et.al. using strongly converging derivations over the complete metric space of infinite terms. Instead according to the "parallel interpretation" a term graph reduction corresponds to the parallel reduction of an infinite set of redexes in a rational term. We formalize the latter notion by exploiting the complete partial order of infinite and possibly partial terms, and we stress that this interpretation allows to explain the result of reducing circular redexes in several approaches to term graph rewriting.',

	{'abstract': u"Multi-hop random access networks have received much attention due to their distributed nature which facilitates deploying many new applications over the sensor and computer networks. Recently, utility maximization framework is applied in order to optimize performance of such networks, however proposed algorithms result in large transmission delays. In this paper, we will analyze delay in random access multi-hop networks and solve the delay-constrained utility maximization problem. We define the network utility as a combination of rate utility and energy cost functions and solve the following two problems: 'optimal medium access control with link delay constraint' and, 'optimal congestion and contention control with end-to-end delay constraint'. The optimal tradeoff between delay, rate, and energy is achieved for different values of delay constraint and the scaling factors between rate and energy. Eventually linear and super-linear distributed optimization solutions are proposed for each problem and their performance are compared in terms of convergence and complexity.",

The objectives explored here are exponential-average length and exponential-average redundancy. The first of these relates to various problems involving queueing, uncertainty, and lossless communications, and it can be reduced to the second, which has properties more amenable to analysis. These bounds, some of which are tight, are in terms of a form of entropy and/or the probability of an input symbol, improving on recently discovered bounds of similar form. We also observe properties of optimal codes over the exponential-average redundancy utility.',

	{'abstract': u"In the last few years, there has been a great interest in detecting overlapping communities in complex networks, which is understood as dense groups of nodes featuring a low outbound density. To date, most methods used to compute such communities stem from the field of disjoint community detection by either extending the concept of modularity to an overlapping context or by attempting to decompose the whole set of nodes into several possibly overlapping subsets. In this report we take an orthogonal approach by introducing a metric, the cohesion, rooted in sociological considerations. The cohesion quantifies the community-ness of one given set of nodes, based on the notions of triangles - triplets of connected nodes - and weak ties, instead of the classical view using only edge density. A set of nodes has a high cohesion if it features a high density of triangles and intersects few triangles with the rest of the network. As such, we introduce a numerical characterization of communities: sets of nodes featuring a high cohesion. We then present a new approach to the problem of overlapping communities by introducing the concept of ego-munities, which are subjective communities centered around a given node, specifically inside its neighborhood. We build upon the cohesion to construct a heuristic algorithm which outputs a node's ego-munities by attempting to maximize their cohesion. We illustrate the pertinence of our method with a detailed description of one person's ego-munities among Facebook friends. We finally conclude by describing promising applications of ego-munities such as information inference and interest recommendations, and present a possible extension to cohesion in the case of weighted networks.",

	{'abstract': u"Energy consumption is a main issue of concern in wireless networks. Energy minimization increases the time that networks' nodes work properly without recharging or substituting batteries. Another criterion for network performance is data transmission rate which is usually quantified by a network utility function. There exists an inherent tradeoff between these criteria and enhancing one of them can deteriorate the other one. In this paper, we consider both Network Utility Maximization (NUM) and energy minimization in a bi-criterion optimization problem. The problem is formulated for Random Access (RA) Medium Access Control (MAC) for ad-hoc networks. First, we optimize performance of the MAC and define utility as a monotonically increasing function of link throughputs. We investigate the optimal tradeoff between energy and utility in this part. In the second part, we define utility as a function of end to end rates and optimize MAC and transport layers simultaneously. We calculate optimal persistence probabilities and end-to-end rates. Finally, by means of duality theorem, we decompose the problem into smaller subproblems, which are solved at node and network layers separately. This decomposition avoids need for a central unit while sustaining benefits of layering.",

	{'abstract': u'In case of multiple node failures performance becomes very low as compare to single node failure. Failures of nodes in cluster computing can be tolerated by multiple fault tolerant computing. Existing recovery schemes are efficient for single fault but not with multiple faults. Recovery scheme proposed in this paper having two phases; sequentially phase, concurrent phase. In sequentially phase, loads of all working nodes are uniformly and evenly distributed by proposed dynamic rank based and load distribution algorithm. In concurrent phase, loads of all failure nodes as well as new job arrival are assigned equally to all available nodes by just finding the least loaded node among the several nodes by failure nodes job allocation algorithm. Sequential and concurrent executions of algorithms improve the performance as well better resource utilization. Dynamic rank based algorithm for load redistribution works as a sequential restoration algorithm and reassignment algorithm for distribution of failure nodes to least loaded computing nodes works as a concurrent recovery reassignment algorithm. Since load is evenly and uniformly distributed among all available working nodes with less number of iterations, low iterative time and communication overheads hence performance is improved. Dynamic ranking algorithm is low overhead, high convergence algorithm for reassignment of tasks uniformly among all available nodes. Reassignments of failure nodes are done by a low overhead efficient failure job allocation algorithm. Test results to show effectiveness of the proposed scheme are presented.',

	{'abstract': u'Rate, energy and delay are three main parameters of interest in ad-hoc networks. In this paper, we discuss the problem of maximizing network utility and minimizing energy consumption while satisfying a given transmission delay constraint for each packet. We formulate this problem in the standard convex optimization form and subsequently discuss the tradeoff between utility, energy and delay in such framework. Also, in order to adapt for the distributed nature of the network, a distributed algorithm where nodes decide on choosing transmission rates and probabilities based on their local information is introduced.',

	{'abstract': u"Cloud computing is one of the rapidly improving technologies. It provides scalable resources needed for the ap- plications hosted on it. As cloud-based services become more dynamic, resource provisioning becomes more challenging. The QoS constrained resource allocation problem is considered in this paper, in which customers are willing to host their applications on the provider's cloud with a given SLA requirements for performance such as throughput and response time. Since, the data centers hosting the applications consume huge amounts of energy and cause huge operational costs, solutions that reduce energy consumption as well as operational costs are gaining importance. In this work, we propose an energy efficient mechanism that allocates the cloud resources to the applications without violating the given service level agreements(SLA) using Ant colony framework.",

	{'abstract': u'In this paper, we propose novel state-based algorithms which dynamically control the random access network based on its current state such as channel states of wireless links and backlog states of the queues. After formulating the problem, corresponding algorithms with diverse control functions are proposed. Consequently, it will be shown that the proposed state-based schemes for control of the random access networks, results in significant performance gains in comparison with previously proposed control algorithms. In order to select an appropriate control function, performances of the state-based control algorithms are compared for a wide range of traffic scenarios. It is also shown that even an approximate knowledge of network statistics helps in selecting the proper state dependent control function.',

	{'abstract': u'This paper addresses rate control for transmission of scalable video streams via Network Utility Maximization (NUM) formulation. Due to stringent QoS requirements of video streams and specific characterization of utility experienced by end-users, one has to solve nonconvex and even nonsmooth NUM formulation for such streams, where dual methods often prove incompetent. Convexification plays an important role in this work as it permits the use of existing dual methods to solve an approximate to the NUM problem iteratively and distributively. Hence, to tackle the nonsmoothness and nonconvexity, we aim at reformulating the NUM problem through approximation and transformation of the ideal discretely adaptive utility function for scalable video streams. The reformulated problem is shown to be a D.C. (Difference of Convex) problem. We leveraged Sequential Convex Programming (SCP) approach to replace the nonconvex D.C. problem by a sequence of convex problems that aim to approximate the original D.C. problem. We then solve each convex problem produced by SCP approach using existing dual methods. This procedure is the essence of two distributed iterative rate control algorithms proposed in this paper, for which one can show the convergence to a locally optimal point of the nonconvex D.C. problem and equivalently to a locally optimal point of an approximate to the original nonconvex problem. Our experimental results show that the proposed rate control algorithms converge with tractable convergence behavior.',

	{'abstract': u'The paper discusses properties of a DATALOG-like query language 4QL, originally outlined in [MS10]. Negated literals in heads of rules naturally lead to inconsistencies. On the other hand, rules do not have to attach meaning to some literals. Therefore 4QL is founded on a four-valued semantics, employing the logic introduced in [MSV08, VMS09] with truth values: \'true\', \'false\', \'inconsistent\' and \'unknown\'. 4QL allows one to use rules with negation in heads and bodies of rules, it is based on a simple and intuitive semantics and provides uniform tools for "lightweight" versions of known forms of nonmonotonic reasoning. In addition, 4QL is tractable as regards its data complexity and captures PTIME queries. Even if DATALOG is known as a concept for the last 30 years, to our best knowledge no existing approach enjoys these properties. In the current paper we: - investigate properties of well-supported models of 4QL - prove the correctness of the algorithm for computing well-supported models - show that 4QL has PTIME data complexity and captures PTIME.',

	{'abstract': u'In this paper, we present a new method for variable elimination in systems of inequations which is much faster than the Fourier-Motzkin Elimination (FME) method. In our method, a linear Diophantine problem is introduced which is dual to our original problem. The new Diophantine system is then solved, and the final result is calculated by finding the dual inequations system. Our new method uses the algorithm Normaliz to find the Hilbert basis of the solution space of the given Diophantine problem. We introduce a problem in the interference channel with multiple nodes and solve it with our new method. Next, we generalize our method to all problems involving FME and in the end we compare our method with the previous method. We show that our method has many advantages in comparison to the previous method. It does not produce many of the redundant answers of the FME method. It also solves the whole problem in one step whereas the previous method uses a step by step approach in eliminating each auxiliary variable.',

	{'abstract': u"A sensor network can be described as a collection of sensor nodes which co-ordinate with each other to perform some specific function. These sensor nodes are mainly in large numbers and are densely deployed either inside the phenomenon or very close to it. They can be used for various application areas (e.g. health, military, home). Failures are inevitable in wireless sensor networks due to inhospitable environment and unattended deployment. Therefore, it is necessary that network failures are detected in advance and appropriate measures are taken to sustain network operation. We previously proposed a cellular approach for fault detection and recovery. In this paper we extend the cellular approach and propose a new fault management mechanism to deal with fault detection and recovery. We propose a hierarchical structure to properly distribute fault management tasks among sensor nodes by introducing more 'self-managing' functions. The proposed failure detection and recovery algorithm has been compared with some existing related work and proven to be more energy efficient.",

Virtual machines (VMs) are utilized to satisfy the user needs and are placed on physical machines (PMs) of the cloud for effective usage of hardware resources and electricity in the cloud. Optimizing the number of PMs used helps in cutting down the power consumption by a substantial amount. In this paper, we present an optimal technique to map virtual machines to physical machines (nodes) such that the number of required nodes is minimized.

	{'abstract': u'Lifted maximum rank distance (MRD) codes, which are constant dimension codes, are considered. It is shown that a lifted MRD code can be represented in such a way that it forms a block design known as a transversal design. A slightly different representation of this design makes it similar to a analog of a transversal design. The structure of these designs is used to obtain upper bounds on the sizes of constant dimension codes which contain a lifted MRD code. Codes which attain these bounds are constructed. These codes are the largest known codes for the given parameters. These transversal designs can be also used to derive a new family of linear codes in the Hamming space. Bounds on the minimum distance and the dimension of such codes are given.',

	{'abstract': u'The high-level contribution of this paper is a simulation-based analysis to evaluate the tradeoffs between lifetime and hop count of link-disjoint, node-disjoint and zone-disjoint multi-path routes vis- `a-vis single-path minimum hop routes for mobile ad hoc networks. The link-disjoint, node-disjoint and zone-disjoint algorithms proposed in this paper can be used to arrive at benchmarks for the time between successive multi-path route discoveries, the number of disjoint paths per multi-path set and the hop count per multi-path set. We assume a multi-path set exists as long as at least one path in the set exists. Simulation results indicate that the number of zone-disjoint paths per multi-path set can be at most 2, which is far lower than the number of node and link-disjoint paths available per multi-path set. Also, the time between zone-disjoint multi-path discoveries would be far lower than the time between node and link-disjoint multi-path route discoveries and can be at most 45% more than the time between single minimum-hop path route discoveries. However, there is no appreciable difference in the average hop counts per zone-disjoint, node-disjoint and link-disjoint multi-path sets and it can be only at most 15% more than the average minimum hop count determined using single-path routing. We also observe that even though the number of link-disjoint paths per multi-path set can be as large as 35-78% more than the number of node-disjoint paths per multi-path set, the time between two successive link-disjoint multi-path discoveries can be at most 15-25% more than the time between two successive node-disjoint multi-path discoveries, without any significant difference in the hop count per multi-path set.',

	{'abstract': u'In reaction to a previous critique(Opthof &amp; Leydesdorff, 2010), the Center for Science and Technology Studies (CWTS) in Leiden proposed to change their old "crown" indicator in citation analysis into a new one. Waltman et al. (2011)argue that this change does not affect rankings at various aggregated levels. However, CWTS data is not publicly available for testing and criticism. In this correspondence, we use previously published data of Van Raan (2006) to address the pivotal issue of how the results of citation analysis correlate with the results of peer review. A quality parameter based on peer review was neither significantly correlated with the two parameters developed by the CWTS in the past (CPP/JCSm or CPP/FCSm) nor with the more recently proposed h-index (Hirsch, 2005). Given the high correlations between the old and new "crown" indicators, one can expect that the lack of correlation with the peer-review based quality indicator applies equally to the newly developed ones.',

	{'abstract': u'Traffic Engineering (TE) leverages information of network traffic to generate a routing scheme optimizing the traffic distribution so as to advance network performance. However, optimize the link weights for OSPF to the offered traffic is an known NP-hard problem. In this paper, motivated by the fairness concept of congestion control, we firstly propose a new generic objective function, where various interests of providers can be extracted with different parameter settings. And then, we model the optimal TE as the utility maximization of multi-commodity flows with the generic objective function and theoretically show that any given set of optimal routes corresponding to a particular objective function can be converted to shortest paths with respect to a set of positive link weights. This can be directly configured on OSPF-based protocols. On these bases, we employ the Network Entropy Maximization(NEM) framework and develop a new OSPF-based routing protocol, SPEF, to realize a flexible way to split traffic over shortest paths in a distributed fashion. Actually, comparing to OSPF, SPEF only needs one more weight for each link and provably achieves optimal TE. Numerical experiments have been done to compare SPEF with the current version of OSPF, showing the effectiveness of SPEF in terms of link utilization and network load distribution.',

	{'abstract': u'One of the most important open problems in machine scheduling is the problem of scheduling a set of jobs on unrelated machines to minimize the makespan. The best known approximation algorithm for this problem guarantees an approximation factor of 2. It is known to be NP-hard to approximate with a better ratio than 3/2. Closing this gap has been open for over 20 years. The best known approximation factors are achieved by LP-based algorithms. The strongest known linear program formulation for the problem is the configuration-LP. We show that the configuration-LP has an integrality gap of 2 even for the special case of unrelated graph balancing, where each job can be assigned to at most two machines. In particular, our result implies that a large family of cuts does not help to diminish the integrality gap of the canonical assignment-LP. Also, we present cases of the problem which can be approximated with a better factor than 2. They constitute valuable insights for constructing an NP-hardness reduction which improves the known lower bound. Very recently Svensson studied the restricted assignment case, where each job can only be assigned to a given set of machines on which it has the same processing time. He shows that in this setting the configuration-LP has an integrality gap of 33/17&lt;2. Hence, our result imply that the unrelated graph balancing case is significantly more complex than the restricted assignment case. Then we turn to another objective function: maximizing the minimum machine load. For the case that every job can be assigned to at most two machines we give a purely combinatorial 2-approximation algorithm which is best possible, unless P=NP. This improves on the computationally costly LP-based (2+eps)-approximation algorithm by Chakrabarty et al.',

	{'abstract': u'We investigate the problem of finding reverse nearest neighbors efficiently. Although provably good solutions exist for this problem in low or fixed dimensions, to this date the methods proposed in high dimensions are mostly heuristic. We introduce a method that is both provably correct and efficient in all dimensions, based on a reduction of the problem to one instance of -nearest neighbor search plus a controlled number of instances of , a variant of where all the -balls centered at the data points that contain the query point are sought for, not just one. The former problem has been extensively studied and elegantly solved in high dimensions using Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) techniques. By contrast, the latter problem has a complexity that is still not fully understood. We revisit the analysis of the LSH scheme for exhaustive - pleb using a somewhat refined notion of locality-sensitive family of hash function, which brings out a meaningful output-sensitive term in the complexity of the problem. Our analysis, combined with a non-isometric lifting of the data, enables us to answer exhaustive - pleb queries (and down the road reverse nearest neighbors queries) efficiently. Along the way, we obtain a simple algorithm for answering exact nearest neighbor queries, whose complexity is parametrized by some measuring the inherent difficulty of a given instance of the problem.',

In this paper, we show that the dyadic variant can be designed to resist all known attacks. In light of a new study on list decoding algorithms for binary Goppa codes, we explain how to increase the security level for given public keysizes. Using the state-of-the-art list decoding algorithm instead of unique decoding, we exhibit a keysize gain of about 4% for the standard McEliece cryptosystem and up to 21% for the adjusted dyadic variant.',

	{'abstract': u"We consider the problem of sensor selection for event detection in wireless sensor networks (WSNs). We want to choose a subset of p out of n sensors that yields the best detection performance. As the sensor selection optimality criteria, we propose the Kullback-Leibler and Chernoff distances between the distributions of the selected measurements under the two hypothesis. We formulate the maxmin robust sensor selection problem to cope with the uncertainties in distribution means. We prove that the sensor selection problem is NP hard, for both Kullback-Leibler and Chernoff criteria. To (sub)optimally solve the sensor selection problem, we propose an algorithm of affordable complexity. Extensive numerical simulations on moderate size problem instances (when the optimum by exhaustive search is feasible to compute) demonstrate the algorithm's near optimality in a very large portion of problem instances. For larger problems, extensive simulations demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms random searches, once an upper bound on computational time is set. We corroborate numerically the validity of the Kullback-Leibler and Chernoff sensor selection criteria, by showing that they lead to sensor selections nearly optimal both in the Neyman-Pearson and Bayes sense.",

	{'abstract': u'A challenging problem in multi-band multi-cell self-organized wireless systems, such as multi-channel Wi-Fi networks, femto/pico cells in 3G/4G cellular networks, and more recent wireless networks over TV white spaces, is of distributed resource allocation. This involves four components: channel selection, client association, channel access, and client scheduling. In this paper, we present a unified framework for jointly addressing the four components with the global system objective of maximizing the clients throughput in a proportionally fair manner. Our formulation allows a natural dissociation of the problem into two sub-parts. We show that the first part, involving channel access and client scheduling, is convex and derive a distributed adaptation procedure for achieving Pareto-optimal solution. For the second part, involving channel selection and client association, we develop a Gibbs-sampler based approach for local adaptation to achieve the global objective, as well as derive fast greedy algorithms from it that achieve good solutions.',

	{'abstract': u'Analyzing the relationships among the parameters for quantifying the quality of research published in journals is a challenging task. In this paper, we analyze the relationships between impact factor, h-index, and g-index of a journal. To keep our analysis simple and easy to understand, we consider a generalized version of the impact factor where there is no time window. In the absence of the time window, the impact factor converges to the number of citations received per paper. This is not only justified for the impact factor, it simplifies the analysis of h-index and g-index as well because addition of a time window in the form of years complicates the computation of indices too. We derive the expressions for the relationships among impact factor, h-index, and g-index and validate them using a given set of publication-citation data.',

	{'abstract': u'In this paper we consider a logical treatment for the ordered disjunction operator \'x\' introduced by Brewka, Niemel "a and Syrj "anen in their Logic Programs with Ordered Disjunctions (LPOD). LPODs are used to represent preferences in logic programming under the answer set semantics. Their semantics is defined by first translating the LPOD into a set of normal programs (called split programs) and then imposing a preference relation among the answer sets of these split programs. We concentrate on the first step and show how a suitable translation of the ordered disjunction as a derived operator into the logic of Here-and-There allows capturing the answer sets of the split programs in a direct way. We use this characterisation not only for providing an alternative implementation for LPODs, but also for checking several properties (under strongly equivalent transformations) of the \'x\' operator, like for instance, its distributivity with respect to conjunction or regular disjunction. We also make a comparison to an extension proposed by K "arger, Lopes, Olmedilla and Polleres, that combines \'x\' with regular disjunction.',

In particular, we show that the expected termination time can be approximated up to an arbitrarily small relative error with polynomially many arithmetic operations, and the same holds for the probability of all runs that satisfy a given omega-regular property. Further, our results establish a powerful link between pOC and martingale theory, which leads to fundamental observations about quantitative properties of runs in pOC. In particular, we provide a "divergence gap theorem", which bounds a positive non-termination probability in pOC away from zero.',

The solving scheme is based on several models: multicriteria ranking, clustering, minimum spanning tree, and minimum Steiner tree problem. An illustrative numerical example corresponds to designing a covering long-distance Wi-Fi network (static Ad-Hoc network). The set of criteria (i.e., objective functions) involves the following: total cost, total edge length, overall throughput (capacity), and estimate of QoS. Obtained computing results show the suggested solving scheme provides good network topologies which can be compared with minimum spanning trees.',

	{'abstract': u'Pair-wise Markov random fields (MRF) are considered for application to the development of low complexity, iterative MIMO detection. Specifically, we consider two types of MRF, namely, the fully-connected and ring-type. For the edge potentials, we use the bivariate Gaussian function obtained by marginalizing the posterior joint probability density under the Gaussian assumption. Since the corresponding factor graphs are sparse, in the sense that the number of edges connected to a factor node (edge degree) is only 2, the computations are much easier than that of ML, which is similar to the belief propagation (BP), or sum-product, algorithm that is run over the fully connected factor graph. The BER performances for non-Gaussian input are evaluated via simulation, and the results show the validity of the proposed algorithms. We also customize the algorithm for Gaussian input to obtain the Gaussian BP that is run over the two MRF and proves its convergence in mean to the linear MMSE estimates. The result lies on the same line of those in [16] and [24], but with differences in its graphical model and the message passing rule. Since the MAP estimator for the Gaussian input is equivalent to the linear MMSE estimator, it shows the optimality, in mean, of the scheme for Gaussian input.',

	{'abstract': u'We present an iterative algorithm for enforcing policies represented in a first-order logic, which can, in particular, express all transmission-related clauses in the HIPAA Privacy Rule. The logic has three features that raise challenges for enforcement --- uninterpreted predicates (used to model subjective concepts in privacy policies), real-time temporal properties, and quantification over infinite domains (such as the set of messages containing personal information). The algorithm operates over audit logs that are inherently incomplete and evolve over time. In each iteration, the algorithm provably checks as much of the policy as possible over the current log and outputs a residual policy that can only be checked when the log is extended with additional information. We prove correctness and termination properties of the algorithm. While these results are developed in a general form, accounting for many different sources of incompleteness in audit logs, we also prove that for the special case of logs that maintain a complete record of all relevant actions, the algorithm effectively enforces all safety and co-safety properties. The algorithm can significantly help automate enforcement of policies derived from the HIPAA Privacy Rule.',

	{'abstract': u"In this paper, coded slotted ALOHA (CSA) is introduced as a powerful random access scheme to the MAC frame. In CSA, the burst a generic user wishes to transmit in the MAC frame is first split into segments, and these segments are then encoded through a local a packet-oriented code prior to transmission. On the receiver side, iterative interference cancellation combined with decoding of the local code is performed to recover from collisions. The new scheme generalizes the previously proposed irregular repetition slotted ALOHA (IRSA) technique, based on a simple repetition of the users' bursts. An interpretation of the CSA interference cancellation process as an iterative erasure decoding process over a sparse bipartite graph is identified, and the corresponding density evolution equations derived. Based on these equations, asymptotically optimal CSA schemes are designed for several rates and their performance for a finite number of users investigated through simulation and compared to IRSA competitors. Throughputs as high as 0.8 are demonstrated. The new scheme turns out to be a good candidate in contexts where power efficiency is required.",

The general CSP is known to be NP-complete, but its complexity depends on a template, usually a set of relations, upon which they are constructed. Following this template, there exist tractable and intractable instances of CSPs. It has been proved that for each CSP problem over a given set of relations there exists a corresponding CSP problem over graphs of unary functions belonging to the same complexity class.

	{'abstract': u"We consider a wireless relay network with multiple antenna terminals over Rayleigh fading channels, and apply distributed space-time coding (DSTC) in amplify-and-forward (A&amp;F) mode. The A&amp;F scheme is used in a way that each relay transmits a scaled version of the linear combination of the received symbols. It turns out that, combined with power allocation in the relays, A&amp;F DSTC results in an opportunistic relaying scheme, in which only the best relay is selected to retransmit the source's space-time coded signal. Furthermore, assuming the knowledge of source-relay CSI at the source node, we design an efficient power allocation which outperforms uniform power allocation across the source antennas. Next, assuming M-PSK or M-QAM modulations, we analyze the performance of the proposed cooperative diversity transmission schemes in a wireless relay networks with the multiple-antenna source and destination. We derive the probability density function (PDF) of the received SNR at the destination. Then, the PDF is used to determine the symbol error rate (SER) in Rayleigh fading channels. We derived closed-form approximations of the average SER in the high SNR scenario, from which we find the diversity order of system RminfNs;Ndg, where R, Ns, and Nd are the number of the relays, source antennas, and destination antennas, respectively. Simulation results show that the proposed system obtain more than 6 dB gain in SNR over A&amp;F MIMO DSTC for BER 10^, when R = 2, Ns = 2, and Nd = 1.",

	{'abstract': u'The broadcast phase (downlink transmission) of the two-way relay network is studied in the source coding and joint source-channel coding settings. The rates needed for reliable communication are characterised for a number of special cases including: small distortions, deterministic distortion measures, and jointly Gaussian sources with quadratic distortion measures. The broadcast problem is also studied with common-reconstruction decoding constraints, and the rates needed for reliable communication are characterised for all discrete memoryless sources and per-letter distortion measures.',

	{'abstract': u'This paper investigates the problem of spectrally efficient operation of a multiuser uplink cognitive radio system in the presence of a single primary link. The secondary system applies opportunistic interference cancelation (OIC) and decode the primary signal when such an opportunity is created. We derive the achievable rate in the secondary system when OIC is used. This scheme has a practical significance, since it enables rate adaptation without requiring any action from the primary system. The emph expressions for outage probability of the primary user are derived, when the primary system is exposed to interference from secondary users. Moreover, approximated formulas and tight lower and upper bounds for the ergodic sum-rate capacity of the secondary network are found. Next, the power allocation is investigated in the secondary system for maximizing the sum-rate under an outage constraint at the primary system. We formulate the power optimization problem in various scenarios depending on the availability of channel state information and the type of power constraints, and propose a set of simple solutions. Finally, the analytical results are confirmed by simulations, indicating both the accuracy of the analysis, and the fact that the spectral-efficient, low-complexity, flexible, and high-performing cognitive radio can be designed based on the proposed schemes.',

	{'abstract': u"Model theoretic results such as Characterization and Definability give important information about different logics. It is well known that the proofs of those results for several modal logics have, somehow, the same 'taste'. A general proof for most modal logics below first order is still too ambitious. In this thesis we plan to isolate sufficient conditions for the characterization and definability theorems to hold in a wide range of logics. Along with these conditions we will prove that, whichever logic that meets them, satisfies both theorems. Therefore, one could give an unifying proof for logics with already known results. Moreover, one will be able to prove characterization and definability results for logics that have not yet been investigated. In both cases, it is only needed to check that a logic meets the requirements to automatically derive the desired results.",

	{'abstract': u'We consider two-source two-destination (i.e., two-unicast) multi-hop wireless networks that have a layered structure with arbitrary connectivity. We show that, if the channel gains are chosen independently according to continuous distributions, then, with probability 1, two-unicast layered Gaussian networks can only have 1, 3/2 or 2 sum degrees-of-freedom (unless both source-destination pairs are disconnected, in which case no degrees-of-freedom can be achieved). We provide sufficient and necessary conditions for each case based on network connectivity and a new notion of source-destination paths with manageable interference. Our achievability scheme is based on forwarding the received signals at all nodes, except for a small fraction of them in at most two key layers. Hence, we effectively create a "condensed network" that has at most four layers (including the sources layer and the destinations layer). We design the transmission strategies based on the structure of this condensed network. The converse results are obtained by developing information-theoretic inequalities that capture the structures of the network connectivity. Finally, we extend this result and characterize the full degrees-of-freedom region of two-unicast layered wireless networks.',

	{'abstract': u'Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Enhanced Collision Avoidance (CSMA/ECA) is a distributed MAC protocol that allows collision-free access to the medium in WLAN. The only difference between CSMA/ECA and the well-known CSMA/CA is that the former uses a deterministic backoff after successful transmissions. Collision-free operation is reached after a transient state during which some collisions may occur. This article shows that the duration of the transient state can be shortened by appropriately setting the contention parameters. Standard absorbing Markov Chain theory can be used to describe the behaviour of the system in the transient state and to predict the expected number of slots to reach the collision-free operation. The article also introduces CSMA/E2CA, in which a deterministic backoff is used two consecutive times after a successful transmission. CSMA/E2CA converges quicker to collision-free operation and delivers higher performance than CSMA/CA in harsh wireless scenarios with high frame error rates. To achieve collision-free operations when the number of contenders is large, it may be necessary to dynamically adjust the contention parameter. The last part of the article suggests an approach for such parameter adjustment which is validated by simulation results.',

	{'abstract': u'"What other people think" has always been an important piece of information during various decision-making processes. Today people frequently make their opinions available via the Internet, and as a result, the Web has become an excellent source for gathering consumer opinions. There are now numerous Web resources containing such opinions, e.g., product reviews forums, discussion groups, and Blogs. But, due to the large amount of information and the wide range of sources, it is essentially impossible for a customer to read all of the reviews and make an informed decision on whether to purchase the product. It is also difficult for the manufacturer or seller of a product to accurately monitor customer opinions. For this reason, mining customer reviews, or opinion mining, has become an important issue for research in Web information extraction. One of the important topics in this research area is the identification of opinion polarity. The opinion polarity of a review is usually expressed with values \'positive\', \'negative\' or \'neutral\'. We propose a technique for identifying polarity of reviews by identifying the polarity of the adjectives that appear in them. Our evaluation shows the technique can provide accuracy in the area of 73%, which is well above the 58%-64% provided by naive Bayesian classifiers.',

	{'abstract': u'In this paper we propose a new wavelet transform applicable to functions defined on graphs, high dimensional data and networks. The proposed method generalizes the Haar-like transform proposed in [1], and it is defined via a hierarchical tree, which is assumed to capture the geometry and structure of the input data. It is applied to the data using a modified version of the common one-dimensional (1D) wavelet filtering and decimation scheme, which can employ different wavelet filters. In each level of this wavelet decomposition scheme, a permutation derived from the tree is applied to the approximation coefficients, before they are filtered. We propose a tree construction method that results in an efficient representation of the input function in the transform domain. We show that the proposed transform is more efficient than both the 1D and two-dimensional (2D) separable wavelet transforms in representing images. We also explore the application of the proposed transform to image denoising, and show that combined with a subimage averaging scheme, it achieves denoising results which are similar to those obtained with the K-SVD algorithm.',

	{'abstract': u'Smartphone apps often run with full privileges to access the network and sensitive local resources, making it difficult for remote systems to have any trust in the provenance of network connections they receive. Even within the phone, different apps with different privileges can communicate with one another, allowing one app to trick another into improperly exercising its privileges (a Confused Deputy attack). In Quire, we engineered two new security mechanisms into Android to address these issues. First, we track the call chain of IPCs, allowing an app the choice of operating with the diminished privileges of its callers or to act explicitly on its own behalf. Second, a lightweight signature scheme allows any app to create a signed statement that can be verified anywhere inside the phone. Both of these mechanisms are reflected in network RPCs, allowing remote systems visibility into the state of the phone when an RPC is made. We demonstrate the usefulness of Quire with two example applications. We built an advertising service, running distinctly from the app which wants to display ads, which can validate clicks passed to it from its host. We also built a payment service, allowing an app to issue a request which the payment service validates with the user. An app cannot not forge a payment request by directly connecting to the remote server, nor can the local payment service tamper with the request.',

	{'abstract': u'Optimal prefix codes are studied for pairs of independent, integer-valued symbols emitted by a source with a geometric probability distribution of parameter , . By encoding pairs of symbols, it is possible to reduce the redundancy penalty of symbol-by-symbol encoding, while preserving the simplicity of the encoding and decoding procedures typical of Golomb codes and their variants. It is shown that optimal codes for these so-called two-dimensional geometric distributions are emph, in the sense that a prefix code that is optimal for one value of the parameter cannot be optimal for any other value of . This is in sharp contrast to the one-dimensional case, where codes are optimal for positive-length intervals of the parameter . Thus, in the two-dimensional case, it is infeasible to give a compact characterization of optimal codes for all values of the parameter , as was done in the one-dimensional case. Instead, optimal codes are characterized for a discrete sequence of values of that provide good coverage of the unit interval. Specifically, optimal prefix codes are described for (), covering the range , and (), covering the range . The described codes produce the expected reduction in redundancy with respect to the one-dimensional case, while maintaining low complexity coding operations.',

	{'abstract': u'This paper considers a system where one transmitter broadcasts a single common message to two receivers linked by a bidirectional cooperation channel, which is assumed to be orthogonal to the downlink channel. Assuming a simplified setup where, in particular, scalar relaying protocols are used and channel coding is not exploited, we want to provide elements of response to several questions of practical interest. Here are the main underlying issues: 1. The way of recombining the signals at the receivers; 2. The optimal number of cooperation rounds; 3. The way of cooperating (symmetrically or asymmetrically; which receiver should start cooperating in the latter case); 4. The influence of spectral resources. These issues are considered by studying the performance of the assumed system through analytical results when they are derivable and through simulation results. For the particular choices we made, the results sometimes do not coincide with those available for the discrete counterpart of the studied channel.',

	{'abstract': u'We consider wireless networks that can be modeled by multiple access channels in which all the terminals are equipped with multiple antennas. The propagation model used to account for the effects of transmit and receive antenna correlations is the unitary-invariant-unitary model, which is one of the most general models available in the literature. In this context, we introduce and analyze two resource allocation games. In both games, the mobile stations selfishly choose their power allocation policies in order to maximize their individual uplink transmission rates; in particular they can ignore some specified centralized policies. In the first game considered, the base station implements successive interference cancellation (SIC) and each mobile station chooses his best space-time power allocation scheme; here, a coordination mechanism is used to indicate to the users the order in which the receiver applies SIC. In the second framework, the base station is assumed to implement single-user decoding. For these two games a thorough analysis of the Nash equilibrium is provided: the existence and uniqueness issues are addressed; the corresponding power allocation policies are determined by exploiting random matrix theory; the sum-rate efficiency of the equilibrium is studied analytically in the low and high signal-to-noise ratio regimes and by simulations in more typical scenarios. Simulations show that, in particular, the sum-rate efficiency is high for the type of systems investigated and the performance loss due to the use of the proposed suboptimum coordination mechanism is very small.',

	{'abstract': u'Main contribution of this paper is an investigation of expressive power of the database category DB. An object in this category is a database-instance (set of n-ary relations). Morphisms are not functions but have complex tree structures based on a set of complex query computations. They express the semantics of view-based mappings between databases. The higher (logical) level scheme mappings between databases, usually written in some high expressive logical language, may be functorially translated into this base "computation" DB category . The behavioral point of view for databases is assumed, with behavioural equivalence of databases corresponding to isomorphism of objects in DB category. The introduced observations, which are view-based computations without side-effects, are based (from Universal algebra) on monad endofunctor T, which is the closure operator for objects and for morphisms also. It was shown that DB is symmetric (with a bijection between arrows and objects) 2-category, equal to its dual, complete and cocomplete. In this paper we demonstrate that DB is concrete, locally small and finitely presentable. Moreover, it is enriched over itself monoidal symmetric category with a tensor products for matching, and has a parameterized merging database operation. We show that it is an algebraic lattice and we define a database metric space and a subobject classifier: thus, DB category is a monoidal elementary topos.',

	{'abstract': u'The problem of energy-efficient precoding is investigated when the terminals in the system are equipped with multiple antennas. Considering static and fast-fading multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channels, the energy-efficiency is defined as the transmission rate to power ratio and shown to be maximized at low transmit power. The most interesting case is the one of slow fading MIMO channels. For this type of channels, the optimal precoding scheme is generally not trivial. Furthermore, using all the available transmit power is not always optimal in the sense of energy-efficiency (which, in this case, corresponds to the communication-theoretic definition of the goodput-to-power (GPR) ratio). Finding the optimal precoding matrices is shown to be a new open problem and is solved in several special cases: 1. when there is only one receive antenna; 2. in the low or high signal-to-noise ratio regime; 3. when uniform power allocation and the regime of large numbers of antennas are assumed. A complete numerical analysis is provided to illustrate the derived results and stated conjectures. In particular, the impact of the number of antennas on the energy-efficiency is assessed and shown to be significant.',

	{'abstract': u'In this paper, we introduce Continuation Passing C (CPC), a programming language for concurrent systems in which native and cooperative threads are unified and presented to the programmer as a single abstraction. The CPC compiler uses a compilation technique, based on the CPS transform, that yields efficient code and an extremely lightweight representation for contexts. We provide a proof of the correctness of our compilation scheme. We show in particular that lambda-lifting, a common compilation technique for functional languages, is also correct in an imperative language like C, under some conditions enforced by the CPC compiler. The current CPC compiler is mature enough to write substantial programs such as Hekate, a highly concurrent BitTorrent seeder. Our benchmark results show that CPC is as efficient, while using significantly less space, as the most efficient thread libraries available.',

	{'abstract': u'We consider continuous-time consensus seeking systems whose time-dependent interactions are cut-balanced, in the following sense: if a group of agents influences the remaining ones, the former group is also influenced by the remaining ones by at least a proportional amount. Models involving symmetric interconnections and models in which a weighted average of the agent values is conserved are special cases. We prove that such systems always converge. We give a sufficient condition on the evolving interaction topology for the limit values of two agents to be the same. Conversely, we show that if our condition is not satisfied, then these limits are generically different. These results allow treating systems where the agent interactions are a priori unknown, e.g., random or determined endogenously by the agent values. We also derive corresponding results for discrete-time systems.',

	{'abstract': u'Large-scale power blackouts caused by cascading failure are inflicting enormous socioeconomic costs. We study the problem of cascading link failures in power networks modelled by random geometric graphs from a percolation-based viewpoint. To reflect the fact that links fail according to the amount of power flow going through them, we introduce a model where links fail according to a probability which depends on the number of neighboring links. We devise a mapping which maps links in a random geometric graph to nodes in a corresponding dual covering graph. This mapping enables us to obtain the first-known analytical conditions on the existence and non-existence of a large component of operational links after degree-dependent link failures. Next, we present a simple but descriptive model for cascading link failure, and use the degree-dependent link failure results to obtain the first-known analytical conditions on the existence and non-existence of cascading link failures.',

	{'abstract': u"Despite the increasing diffusion of the Internet technology, TV remains the principal medium of communication. People's perceptions, knowledge, beliefs and opinions about matter of facts get (in)formed through the information reported on by the mass-media. However, a single source of information (and consensus) could be a potential cause of anomalies in the structure and evolution of a society. Hence, as the information available (and the way it is reported) is fundamental for our perceptions and opinions, the definition of conditions allowing for a good information to be disseminated is a pressing challenge. In this paper starting from a report on the last Italian political campaign in 2008, we derive a socio-cognitive computational model of opinion dynamics where agents get informed by different sources of information. Then, a what-if analysis, performed trough simulations on the model's parameters space, is shown. In particular, the scenario implemented includes three main streams of information acquisition, differing in both the contents and the perceived reliability of the messages spread. Agents' internal opinion is updated either by accessing one of the information sources, namely media and experts, or by exchanging information with one another. They are also endowed with cognitive mechanisms to accept, reject or partially consider the acquired information.",

	{'abstract': u'We present two methods to compress the description of a route in a road network, i.e., of a path in a directed graph. The first method represents a path by a sequence of via edges. The subpaths between the via edges have to be unique shortest paths. Instead of via edges also via nodes can be used, though this requires some simple preprocessing. The second method uses contraction hierarchies to replace subpaths of the original path by shortcuts. The two methods can be combined with each other. Also, we propose the application to mobile server based routing: We compute the route on a server which has access to the latest information about congestions for example. Then we transmit the computed route to the car using some mobile radio communication. There, we apply the compression to save costs and transmission time. If the compression works well, we can transmit routes even when the bandwidth is low. Although we have not evaluated our ideas with realistic data yet, they are quite promising.',

	{'abstract': u"Generic quantum search algorithm searches for target entity in an unsorted database by repeatedly applying canonical Grover's quantum rotation transform to reach near the vicinity of the target entity represented by a basis state in the Hilbert space associated with the qubits. Thus, when qubits are measured, there is a high probability of finding the target entity. However, the number of times quantum rotation transform is to be applied for reaching near the vicinity of the target is a function of the number of target entities present in the unsorted database, which is generally unknown. A wrong estimate of the number of target entities can lead to overshooting or undershooting the targets, thus reducing the success probability. Some proposals have been made to overcome this limitation. These proposals either employ quantum counting to estimate the number of solutions or fixed point schemes. This paper proposes a new scheme for stopping the application of quantum rotation transformation on reaching near the targets by measurement and subsequent processing to estimate the distance of the state vector from the target states. It ensures a success probability, which is at least greater than half for all the ratios of the number of target entities to the total number of entities in a database, which are less than half. The search problem is trivial for remaining possible ratios. The proposed scheme is simpler than quantum counting and more efficient than the known fixed-point schemes. It has same order of computational complexity as canonical Grover's search algorithm but is slow by a factor of two and requires an additional ancilla qubit.",

	{'abstract': u'Predicate abstraction is a key enabling technology for applying finite-state model checkers to programs written in mainstream languages. It has been used very successfully for debugging sequential system-level C code. Although model checking was originally designed for analyzing concurrent systems, there is little evidence of fruitful applications of predicate abstraction to shared-variable concurrent software. The goal of this paper is to close this gap. We have developed a symmetry-aware predicate abstraction strategy: it takes into account the replicated structure of C programs that consist of many threads executing the same procedure, and generates a Boolean program template whose multi-threaded execution soundly overapproximates the concurrent C program. State explosion during model checking parallel instantiations of this template can now be absorbed by exploiting symmetry. We have implemented our method in the SATABS predicate abstraction framework, and demonstrate its superior performance over alternative approaches on a large range of synchronization programs.',

In this paper, we present new directions of progress in the problem. More specifically, we propose a family of mathematical programs, that depend upon a parameter , and is an extension of the uniform version of the SDPs proposed by Goemans and Linial for this problem. In fact for the case, when , if one can solve this program in polynomial time then simply using the Goemans-Williamson's randomized rounding algorithm for cite will give an -factor approximation algorithm for improving the best known approximation factor of due to Arora, Rao and Vazirani cite. This family of programs is not convex but one can transform them into so called emph in which one optimizes a concave function over a convex feasible set. It is well known that the optima of such programs lie at one of the extreme points of the feasible set cite. Our main contribution is a combinatorial characterization of some extreme points of the feasible set of the mathematical program, for case, which to the best of our knowledge is the first of its kind. We further demonstrate how this characterization can be used to solve the program in a restricted setting.

	{'abstract': u'Canonical inference rules and canonical systems are defined in the framework of non-strict single-conclusion sequent systems, in which the succeedents of sequents can be empty. Important properties of this framework are investigated, and a general non-deterministic Kripke-style semantics is provided. This general semantics is then used to provide a constructive (and very natural), sufficient and necessary coherence criterion for the validity of the strong cut-elimination theorem in such a system. These results suggest new syntactic and semantic characterizations of basic constructive connectives.',

	{'abstract': u'We give a new algorithm for Unique Games which is based on purely techniques, in contrast to previous work in the area, which relies heavily on semidefinite programming (SDP). Given a highly satisfiable instance of Unique Games, our algorithm is able to recover a good assignment. The approximation guarantee depends only on the completeness of the game, and not on the alphabet size, while the running time depends on spectral properties of the graph associated with the instance of Unique Games. We further show that on input the integrality gap instance of Khot and Vishnoi, our algorithm runs in quasi-polynomial time and decides that the instance if highly unsatisfiable. Notably, when run on this instance, the standard SDP relaxation of Unique Games . As a special case, we also re-derive a polynomial time algorithm for Unique Games on expander constraint graphs. The main ingredient of our algorithm is a technique to effectively use the full spectrum of the underlying graph instead of just the second eigenvalue, which is of independent interest. The question of how to take advantage of the full spectrum of a graph in the design of algorithms has been often studied, but no significant progress was made prior to this work.',

	{'abstract': u'For many practical applications of ASP, for instance data integration or planning, query answering is important, and therefore query optimization techniques for ASP are of great interest. Magic Sets are one of these techniques, originally defined for Datalog queries (ASP without disjunction and negation). Dynamic Magic Sets (DMS) are an extension of this technique, which has been proved to be sound and complete for query answering over ASP programs with stratified negation. A distinguishing feature of DMS is that the optimization can be exploited also during the nondeterministic phase of ASP engines. In particular, after some assumptions have been made during the computation, parts of the program may become irrelevant to a query under these assumptions. This allows for dynamic pruning of the search space, which may result in exponential performance gains. In this paper, the correctness of DMS is formally established and proved for brave and cautious reasoning over the class of super-consistent ASP programs (ASP^ programs). ASP^ programs guarantee consistency (i.e., have answer sets) when an arbitrary set of facts is added to them. This result generalizes the applicability of DMS, since the class of ASP^ programs is richer than ASP programs with stratified negation, and in particular includes all odd-cycle-free programs. DMS has been implemented as an extension of DLV, and the effectiveness of DMS for ASP^ programs is empirically confirmed by experimental results with this system.',

	{'abstract': u'Current handoffs are not designed to achieve multiple desirable features simultaneously. This weakness has resulted in handoff schemes that are seamless but not adaptive, or adaptive but not secure, or secure but not autonomous, or autonomous but not correct, etc. To face this limitation, we initiated a research project to develop a new kind of handoff system which attains multiple purposes simultaneously by using context information from the external and internal handoff environment. We envision a cognitive handoff as a multipurpose, multi-criteria, environment-aware, and policy-based handoff that trades-off multiple objectives to reach its intended goals. This paper presents a conceptual (soft) model of cognitive handoffs using a holistic approach. We applied the proposed model to identify cognitive handoff performance parameters and tradeoffs between conflicting objectives. We argue that cognitive handoffs are the archetype of handoffs for the future Internet.',

In this paper, we discuss the difficulties of developing cognitive handoffs and propose a new model-driven methodology for their systematic development. The theoretical framework of this methodology is the holistic approach, the functional decomposition method, the model-based design paradigm, and the theory of design as scientific problem-solving. We applied the proposed methodology and obtained the following results: (i) a correspondence between handoff purposes and quantitative environment information, (ii) a novel taxonomy of handoff mobility scenarios, and (iii) an original state-based model representing the functional behavior of the handoff process.',

The proposed algorithm is referred to as ANFIS Dead Reckoning, which stands for Adaptive Neuro-based Fuzzy Inference System Dead Reckoning is based on a fuzzy inference system which is trained by the learning algorithm derived from the neuronal networks and fuzzy inference theory.

	{'abstract': u'A game theoretic framework is presented to analyze the problem of finding the optimal number of data streams to transmit in a multi-user MIMO scenario, where both the transmitters and receivers are equipped with multiple antennas. Without channel state information (CSI) at any transmitter, and using outage capacity as the utility function with zero-forcing receiver, each user is shown to transmit a single data stream at Nash equilibrium in the presence of sufficient number of users. Transmitting a single data stream is also shown to be optimal in terms of maximizing the sum of the outage capacities in the presence of sufficient number of users. With CSI available at each transmitter, and using the number of successful bits per Joule of energy as the utility function, at Nash equilibrium, each user is shown to transmit a single data stream on the best eigen-mode that requires the least transmit power to achieve a fixed signal-to-interference ratio. Using the concept of locally gross direction preserving maps, existence of Nash equilibrium is shown when the number of successful bits per Joule of energy is used as the utility function.',

	{'abstract': u'We investigate projection methods, for evaluating a linear approximation of the value function of a policy in a Markov Decision Process context. We consider two popular approaches, the one-step Temporal Difference fix-point computation (TD(0)) and the Bellman Residual (BR) minimization. We describe examples, where each method outperforms the other. We highlight a simple relation between the objective function they minimize, and show that while BR enjoys a performance guarantee, TD(0) does not in general. We then propose a unified view in terms of oblique projections of the Bellman equation, which substantially simplifies and extends the characterization of (schoknecht,2002) and the recent analysis of (Yu &amp; Bertsekas, 2008). Eventually, we describe some simulations that suggest that if the TD(0) solution is usually slightly better than the BR solution, its inherent numerical instability makes it very bad in some cases, and thus worse on average.',

	{'abstract': u'If a game has a Nash equilibrium with probability values that are either zero or Omega(1) then this equilibrium can be found exhaustively in polynomial time. Somewhat surprisingly, we show that there is a PTAS for the games whose equilibria are guaranteed to have small-O(1/n)-values, and therefore large-Omega(n)-supports. We also point out that there is a PTAS for games with sparse payoff matrices, which are known to be PPAD-complete to solve exactly. Both algorithms are of a special kind that we call oblivious: The algorithm just samples a fixed distribution on pairs of mixed strategies, and the game is only used to determine whether the sampled strategies comprise an eps-Nash equilibrium; the answer is yes with inverse polynomial probability. These results bring about the question: Is there an oblivious PTAS for Nash equilibrium in general games? We answer this question in the negative; our lower bound comes close to the quasi-polynomial upper bound of [Lipton, Markakis, Mehta 2003]. Another recent PTAS for anonymous games is also oblivious in a weaker sense appropriate for this class of games (it samples from a fixed distribution on unordered collections of mixed strategies), but its runtime is exponential in 1/eps. We prove that any oblivious PTAS for anonymous games with two strategies and three player types must have 1/eps^c in the exponent of the running time for some c&gt;1/3, rendering the algorithm in [Daskalakis 2008] essentially optimal within oblivious algorithms. In contrast, we devise a poly(n) (1/eps)^O(log^2(1/eps)) non-oblivious PTAS for anonymous games with 2 strategies and any bounded number of player types. Our algorithm is based on the construction of a sparse (and efficiently computable) eps-cover of the set of all possible sums of n independent indicators, under the total variation distance. The size of the cover is poly(n) (1/ eps^.',

	{'abstract': u'This volume contains the proceedings of the Sixth International Workshop on Computing with Terms and Graphs (TERMGRAPH 2011). The workshop took place in Saarbruecken, Germany, on April 2nd, 2011, as part of the fourteenth edition of the European Joint Conferences on Theory and Practice of Software (ETAPS 2011). Research in term and graph rewriting ranges from theoretical questions to practical issues. Computing with graphs handles the sharing of common subexpressions in a natural and seamless way, and improves the efficiency of computations in space and time. Sharing is ubiquitous in several research areas, for instance : the modelling of first- and higher-order term rewriting by (acyclic or cyclic) graph rewriting, the modelling of biological or chemical abstract machines, the implementation techniques of programming languages. Term graphs are also used in automated theorem proving and symbolic computation systems working on shared structures. The aim of this workshop is to bring together researchers working in different domains on term and graph transformation and to foster their interaction, to provide a forum for presenting new ideas and work in progress, and to enable newcomers to learn about current activities in term graph rewriting. These proceedings contain six accepted papers and the abstracts of three invited talks. All submissions were subject to careful refereeing. The topics of accepted papers range over a wide spectrum, including theoretical aspects of term graph rewriting, proof methods, semantics as well as application issues of term graph transformation.',

	{'abstract': u"This paper surveys recent work in applying ideas from graphical models and message passing algorithms to solve large scale regularized regression problems. In particular, the focus is on compressed sensing reconstruction via ell_1 penalized least-squares (known as LASSO or BPDN). We discuss how to derive fast approximate message passing algorithms to solve this problem. Surprisingly, the analysis of such algorithms allows to prove exact high-dimensional limit results for the LASSO risk. This paper will appear as a chapter in a book on `Compressed Sensing' edited by Yonina Eldar and Gitta Kutyniok.",

	{'abstract': u'The use of programming languages such as Java and C in Open Source Software (OSS) has been well studied. However, many other popular languages such as XSL or XML have received minor attention. In this paper, we discuss some trends in OSS development that we observed when considering multiple programming language evolution of OSS. Based on the revision data of 22 OSS projects, we tracked the evolution of language usage and other artefacts such as documentation files, binaries and graphics files. In these systems several different languages and artefact types including C/C++, Java, XML, XSL, Makefile, Groovy, HTML, Shell scripts, CSS, Graphics files, JavaScript, JSP, Ruby, Phyton, XQuery, OpenDocument files, PHP, etc. have been used. We found that the amount of code written in different languages differs substantially. Some of our findings can be summarized as follows: (1) JavaScript and CSS files most often co-evolve with XSL; (2) Most Java developers but only every second C/C++ developer work with XML; (3) and more generally, we observed a significant increase of usage of XML and XSL during recent years and found that Java or C are hardly ever the only language used by a developer. In fact, a developer works with more than 5 different artefact types (or 4 different languages) in a project on average.',

	{'abstract': u'The eigenvalues of matrices representing the structure of large-scale complex networks present a wide range of applications, from the analysis of dynamical processes taking place in the network to spectral techniques aiming to rank the importance of nodes in the network. A common approach to study the relationship between the structure of a network and its eigenvalues is to use synthetic random networks in which structural properties of interest, such as degree distributions, are prescribed. Although very common, synthetic models present two major flaws: ( emph) These models are only suitable to study a very limited range of structural properties, and ( emph) they implicitly induce structural properties that are not directly controlled and can deceivingly influence the network eigenvalue spectrum. In this paper, we propose an alternative approach to overcome these limitations. Our approach is not based on synthetic models, instead, we use algebraic graph theory and convex optimization to study how structural properties influence the spectrum of eigenvalues of the network. Using our approach, we can compute with low computational overhead global spectral properties of a network from its local structural properties. We illustrate our approach by studying how structural properties of online social networks influence their eigenvalue spectra.',

The model is based on Wasserstein distance between interval valued data which is generalized to fuzzy data. In addition, Keller's approach is used to identify outliers and reduce their influences. We have also defined a transformation to change our distance to the Euclidean distance. With the help of this approach, the problem of fuzzy clustering of fuzzy data is reduced to fuzzy clustering of crisp data. In order to show the performance of the proposed clustering algorithm, two simulation experiments are discussed.",

	{'abstract': u'We investigate the secure connectivity of wireless sensor networks under the pairwise key distribution scheme of Chan et al.. Unlike recent work which was carried out under the assumption of full visibility, here we assume a (simplified) communication model where unreliable wireless links are represented as on/off channels. We present conditions on how to scale the model parameters so that the network i) has no secure node which is isolated and ii) is securely connected, both with high probability when the number of sensor nodes becomes large. The results are given in the form of zero-one laws, and exhibit significant differences with corresponding results in the full visibility case. Through simulations these zero-one laws are shown to be valid also under a more realistic communication model, i.e., the disk model.',

	{'abstract': u'We introduce a new technique for proving kernelization lower bounds, called cross-composition. A classical problem L cross-composes into a parameterized problem Q if an instance of Q with polynomially bounded parameter value can express the logical OR of a sequence of instances of L. Building on work by Bodlaender et al. (ICALP 2008) and using a result by Fortnow and Santhanam (STOC 2008) we show that if an NP-complete problem cross-composes into a parameterized problem Q then Q does not admit a polynomial kernel unless the polynomial hierarchy collapses. Our technique generalizes and strengthens the recent techniques of using OR-composition algorithms and of transferring the lower bounds via polynomial parameter transformations. We show its applicability by proving kernelization lower bounds for a number of important graphs problems with structural (non-standard) parameterizations, e.g., Chromatic Number, Clique, and Weighted Feedback Vertex Set do not admit polynomial kernels with respect to the vertex cover number of the input graphs unless the polynomial hierarchy collapses, contrasting the fact that these problems are trivially fixed-parameter tractable for this parameter. We have similar lower bounds for Feedback Vertex Set.',

	{'abstract': u'Memoryless channels with synchronization errors as defined by a stochastic channel matrix allowing for symbol insertions and deletions in addition to random errors are considered. Such channels are information stable, hence their Shannon capacity exists. However, computation of the channel capacity is formidable, and only some upper and lower bounds on the capacity (for some special cases) exist. In this short paper, using a simple methodology, we prove that the channel capacity is a convex function of the stochastic channel matrix. Since the more widely studied model of an independent identically distributed (i.i.d.) deletion channel is a particular case, as an immediate corollary to this result we also argue that the i.i.d. deletion channel capacity is a convex function of the deletion probability. We further use this result to improve the existing capacity upper bounds on the deletion channel by a proper "convexification" argument. In particular, we prove that the capacity of the deletion channel, as the deletion probability d --&gt; 1, is upper bounded by (which was also observed by a different (weaker) recent result).',

	{'abstract': u'Distributed search problems are ubiquitous in Artificial Life (ALife). Many distributed search problems require identifying a rare and previously unseen event and producing a rapid response. This challenge amounts to finding and removing an unknown needle in a very large haystack. Traditional computational search models are unlikely to find, nonetheless, appropriately respond to, novel events, particularly given data distributed across multiple platforms in a variety of formats and sources with variable and unknown reliability. Biological systems have evolved solutions to distributed search and response under uncertainty. Immune systems and ant colonies efficiently scale up massively parallel search with automated response in highly dynamic environments, and both do so using distributed coordination without centralized control. These properties are relevant to ALife, where distributed, autonomous, robust and adaptive control is needed to design robot swarms, mobile computing networks, computer security systems and other distributed intelligent systems. They are also relevant for searching, tracking the spread of ideas, and understanding the impact of innovations in online social networks. We review design principles for Scalable Robust, Adaptive, Decentralized search with Automated Response (Scalable RADAR) in biology. We discuss how biological RADAR scales up efficiently, and then discuss in detail how modular search in the immune system can be mimicked or built upon in ALife. Such search mechanisms are particularly useful when components have limited capacity to communicate and social or physical distance makes long distance communication more costly.',

Initial requirements of a 25-MHz conversion rate and 8-bits of resolution where the only given ones. Although additional secondary goals such as low power consumption and small area were stated. The architecture is based on a 1.5 bit per stage structure utilizing digital correction for each stage [12]. A differential switched capacitor circuit consisting of a cascade gm-C op-amp with 200MHz ft is used for sampling and amplification in each stage [12]. Differential dynamic comparators are used to implement the decision levels required for the 1.5-b per stage structure. Correction of the pipeline is accomplished by using digital correction circuit consist of D-latches and full-adders. Area and Power consumption of whole design was 0.24mm2 and 35mW respectively. The maximum sample rate at which the converter gave an adequate output was 33MHz.',

	{'abstract': u"The origin of Malagasy DNA is half African and half Indonesian, nevertheless the Malagasy language, spoken by the entire population, belongs to the Austronesian family. The language most closely related to Malagasy is Maanyan (Greater Barito East group of the Austronesian family), but related languages are also in Sulawesi, Malaysia and Sumatra. For this reason, and because Maanyan is spoken by a population which lives along the Barito river in Kalimantan and which does not possess the necessary skill for long maritime navigation, the ethnic composition of the Indonesian colonizers is still unclear. There is a general consensus that Indonesian sailors reached Madagascar by a maritime trek, but the time, the path and the landing area of the first colonization are all disputed. In this research we try to answer these problems together with other ones, such as the historical configuration of Malagasy dialects, by types of analysis related to lexicostatistics and glottochronology which draw upon the automated method recently proposed by the authors cite. The data were collected by the first author at the beginning of 2010 with the invaluable help of Joselin `a Soafara N 'er 'e and consist of Swadesh lists of 200 items for 23 dialects covering all areas of the Island.",

Objects can be involved in forward movements and rotation; they can be resized and reconfigured; all these movements and situations are considered. On the basis of total movability, the new type of programs - user-driven applications - are designed. These applications continue to work according to their main purposes, but the whole control of WHAT, WHEN, and HOW must appear on the screen is passed from designers to users. Due to the size restriction used on CoRR, the book is divided here into two parts and one appendix is deleted.

	{'abstract': u'Spectrum management has been identified as a crucial step towards enabling the technology of the cognitive radio network (CRN). Most of the current works dealing with spectrum management in the CRN focus on a single task of the problem, e.g., spectrum sensing, spectrum decision, spectrum sharing or spectrum mobility. In this work, we argue that for certain network configurations, jointly performing several tasks of the spectrum management improves the spectrum efficiency. Specifically, we study the uplink resource management problem in a CRN where there exist multiple cognitive users (CUs) and access points (APs), with each AP operates on a set of non-overlapping channels. The CUs, in order to maximize their uplink transmission rates, have to associate to a suitable AP (spectrum decision), and to share the channels belong to this AP with other CUs (spectrum sharing). These tasks are clearly interdependent, and the problem of how they should be carried out efficiently and distributedly is still open in the literature. In this work we formulate this joint spectrum decision and spectrum sharing problem into a non-cooperative game, in which the feasible strategy of a player contains a discrete variable and a continuous vector. The structure of the game is hence very different from most non-cooperative spectrum management game proposed in the literature. We provide characterization of the Nash Equilibrium (NE) of this game, and present a set of novel algorithms that allow the CUs to distributively and efficiently select the suitable AP and share the channels with other CUs. Finally, we study the properties of the proposed algorithms as well as their performance via extensive simulations.',

	{'abstract': u'To harness the ever growing capacity and decreasing cost of storage, providing an abstraction of dependable storage in the presence of crash-stop and Byzantine failures is compulsory. We propose a decentralized Reed Solomon coding mechanism with minimum communication overhead. Using a progressive data retrieval scheme, a data collector contacts only the necessary number of storage nodes needed to guarantee data integrity. The scheme gracefully adapts the cost of successful data retrieval to the number of storage node failures. Moreover, by leveraging the Welch-Berlekamp algorithm, it avoids unnecessary computations. Compared to the state-of-the-art decoding scheme, the implementation and evaluation results show that our progressive data retrieval scheme has up to 35 times better computation performance for low Byzantine node rates. Additionally, the communication cost in data retrieval is derived analytically and corroborated by Monte-Carlo simulation results. Our implementation is flexible in that the level of redundancy it provides is independent of the number of data generating nodes, a requirement for distributed storage systems',

We investigate the influence of common attributes at the dyad level in terms of assortativity coefficients and regression models. We then examine larger-scale groupings by detecting communities algorithmically and comparing them to network partitions based on the user characteristics. We thereby compare the relative importances of different characteristics at different institutions, finding for example that common high school is more important to the social organization of large institutions and that the importance of common major varies significantly between institutions. Our calculations illustrate how microscopic and macroscopic perspectives give complementary insights on the social organization at universities and suggest future studies to investigate such phenomena further.',

	{'abstract': u"This paper discusses clustering and latent semantic indexing (LSI) aspects of the singular value decomposition (SVD). The purpose of this paper is twofold. The first is to give an explanation on how and why the singular vectors can be used in clustering. And the second is to show that the two seemingly unrelated SVD aspects actually originate from the same source: related vertices tend to be more clustered in the graph representation of lower rank approximate matrix using the SVD than in the original semantic graph. Accordingly, the SVD can improve retrieval performance of an information retrieval system since queries made to the approximate matrix can retrieve more relevant documents and filter out more irrelevant documents than the same queries made to the original matrix. By utilizing this fact, we will devise an LSI algorithm that mimicks SVD capability in clustering related vertices. Convergence analysis shows that the algorithm is convergent and produces a unique solution for each input. Experimental results using some standard datasets in LSI research show that retrieval performances of the algorithm are comparable to the SVD's. In addition, the algorithm is more practical and easier to use because there is no need to determine decomposition rank which is crucial in driving retrieval performance of the SVD.",

A new generation of distributed applications, such as telemedicine and e-commerce applications, are being deployed in heterogeneous and ubiquitous computing environments. The objective of this paper is to explore an applicability of a component based services in ubiquitous computational environment. While the fundamental structure of various distributed object components is similar, there are differences that can profoundly impact an application developer or the administrator of a distributed simulation exercise and to implement in Ubiquitous Computing Environment.',

	{'abstract': u'In the past, we have observed several large blackouts, i.e. loss of power to large areas. It has been noted by several researchers that these large blackouts are a result of a cascade of failures of various components. As a power grid is made up of several thousands or even millions of components (relays, breakers, transformers, etc.), it is quite plausible that a few of these components do not perform their function as desired. Their failure/misbehavior puts additional burden on the working components causing them to misbehave, and thus leading to a cascade of failures. The complexity of the entire power grid makes it difficult to model each and every individual component and study the stability of the entire system. For this reason, it is often the case that abstract models of the working of the power grid are constructed and then analyzed. These models need to be computationally tractable while serving as a reasonable model for the entire system. In this work, we construct one such model for the power grid, and analyze it.',

	{'abstract': u'In spite of the recent improvements in the performance of the solvers based on the DPLL procedure, it is still possible for the search algorithm to focus on the wrong areas of the search space, preventing the solver from returning a solution in an acceptable amount of time. This prospect is a real concern e.g. in an industrial setting, where users typically expect consistent performance. To overcome this problem, we propose a framework that allows learning and using domain-specific heuristics in solvers based on the DPLL procedure. The learning is done off-line, on representative instances from the target domain, and the learned heuristics are then used for choice-point selection. In this paper we focus on Answer Set Programming (ASP) solvers. In our experiments, the introduction of domain-specific heuristics improved performance on hard instances by up to 3 orders of magnitude (and 2 on average), nearly completely eliminating the cases in which the solver had to be terminated because the wait for an answer had become unacceptable.',

In this paper, we describe an innovative pedagogy using Rapid Digital Game Creation (RDGC) for learning CT skills. RDGC involves the rapid building of digital games with high-level software that requires little or no programming knowledge. We analyze how RDGC supports various CT concepts and how it may be mapped to equivalent Java concepts by building the same game using both RDGC and Java. We discuss the potential benefits of this approach for attracting computing majors, as a precursor to learning formal programming languages, for learning domain knowledge, and for bridging the digital divide.

	{'abstract': u'Predicting the occurrence of links is a fundamental problem in networks. In the link prediction problem we are given a snapshot of a network and would like to infer which interactions among existing members are likely to occur in the near future or which existing interactions are we missing. Although this problem has been extensively studied, the challenge of how to effectively combine the information from the network structure with rich node and edge attribute data remains largely open. We develop an algorithm based on Supervised Random Walks that naturally combines the information from the network structure with node and edge level attributes. We achieve this by using these attributes to guide a random walk on the graph. We formulate a supervised learning task where the goal is to learn a function that assigns strengths to edges in the network such that a random walker is more likely to visit the nodes to which new links will be created in the future. We develop an efficient training algorithm to directly learn the edge strength estimation function. Our experiments on the Facebook social graph and large collaboration networks show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised approaches as well as approaches that are based on feature extraction.',

	{'abstract': u'Resource-bounded measure is a generalization of classical Lebesgue measure that is useful in computational complexity. The central parameter of resource-bounded measure is the , which is a class of functions. When is unrestricted, i.e., contains all functions with the specified domains and codomains, resource-bounded measure coincides with classical Lebesgue measure. On the other hand, when contains functions satisfying some complexity constraint, resource-bounded measure imposes internal measure structure on a corresponding complexity class. Most applications of resource-bounded measure use only the "measure-zero/measure-one fragment" of the theory. For this fragment, can be taken to be a class of type-one functions (e.g., from strings to rationals). However, in the full theory of resource-bounded measurability and measure, the resource bound also contains type-two functionals. To date, both the full theory and its zero-one fragment have been developed in terms of a list of example resource bounds chosen for their apparent utility. This paper replaces this list-of-examples approach with a careful investigation of the conditions that suffice for a class to be a resource bound. Our main theorem says that every class that has the closure properties of Mehlhorn\'s basic feasible functionals is a resource bound for measure. We also prove that the type-2 versions of the time and space hierarchies that have been extensively used in resource-bounded measure have these closure properties. In the course of doing this, we prove theorems establishing that these time and space resource bounds are all robust.',

	{'abstract': u'We describe a model for capturing the statistical structure of local amplitude and local spatial phase in natural images. The model is based on a recently developed, factorized third-order Boltzmann machine that was shown to be effective at capturing higher-order structure in images by modeling dependencies among squared filter outputs (Ranzato and Hinton, 2010). Here, we extend this model to -spherically symmetric subspaces. In order to model local amplitude and phase structure in images, we focus on the case of two dimensional subspaces, and the -norm. When trained on natural images the model learns subspaces resembling quadrature-pair Gabor filters. We then introduce an additional set of hidden units that model the dependencies among subspace phases. These hidden units form a combinatorial mixture of phase coupling distributions, concentrated in the sum and difference of phase pairs. When adapted to natural images, these distributions capture local spatial phase structure in natural images.',

	{'abstract': u'Multi-mode real-time systems are those which support applications with different modes of operation, where each mode is characterized by a specific set of tasks. At run-time, such systems can, at any time, be requested to switch from its current operating mode to another mode (called "new mode") by replacing the current set of tasks with that of the new-mode. Thereby, ensuring that all the timing requirements are met not only requires that a schedulability test is performed on the tasks of each mode but also that (i) a protocol for transitioning from one mode to another is specified and (ii) a schedulability test for each transition is performed. We propose two distinct protocols that manage the mode transitions upon uniform and identical multiprocessor platforms at run-time, each specific to distinct task requirements. For each protocol, we formally establish schedulability analyses that indicate beforehand whether all the timing requirements will be met during any mode transition of the system. This is performed assuming both Fixed-Task-Priority and Fixed-Job-Priority schedulers.',

	{'abstract': u'Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) are heuristic algorithms inspired by natural evolution. They are often used to obtain satisficing solutions in practice. In this paper, we investigate a largely underexplored issue: the approximation performance of EAs in terms of how close the solution obtained is to an optimal solution. We study an EA framework named simple EA with isolated population (SEIP) that can be implemented as a single- or multi-objective EA. We analyze the approximation performance of SEIP using the partial ratio, which characterizes the approximation ratio that can be guaranteed. Specifically, we analyze SEIP using a set cover problem that is NP-hard. We find that in a simple configuration, SEIP efficiently achieves an -approximation ratio, the asymptotic lower bound, for the unbounded set cover problem. We also find that SEIP efficiently achieves an -approximation ratio, the currently best-achievable result, for the k-set cover problem. Moreover, for an instance class of the k-set cover problem, we disclose how SEIP, using either one-bit or bit-wise mutation, can overcome the difficulty that limits the greedy algorithm.',

	{'abstract': u'Partial-monitoring games constitute a mathematical framework for sequential decision making problems with imperfect feedback: The learner repeatedly chooses an action, opponent responds with an outcome, and then the learner suffers a loss and receives a feedback signal, both of which are fixed functions of the action and the outcome. The goal of the learner is to minimize his total cumulative loss. We make progress towards the classification of these games based on their minimax expected regret. Namely, we classify almost all games with two outcomes and finite number of actions: We show that their minimax expected regret is either zero, , , or and we give a simple and efficiently computable classification of these four classes of games.

	{'abstract': u'As the recent financial crisis showed, today there is a strong need to gain "ecological perspective" of all relevant interactions in socio-economic-techno-environmental systems. For this, we suggested to set-up a network of Centers for integrative systems design, which shall be able to run all potentially relevant scenarios, identify causality chains, explore feedback and cascading effects for a number of model variants, and determine the reliability of their implications (given the validity of the underlying models). They will be able to detect possible negative side effect of policy decisions, before they occur. The Centers belonging to this network of Integrative Systems Design Centers would be focused on a particular field, but they would be part of an attempt to eventually cover all relevant areas of society and economy and integrate them within a "Living Earth Simulator". The results of all research activities of such Centers would be turned into informative input for political Decision Arenas. For example, Crisis Observatories (for financial instabilities, shortages of resources, environmental change, conflict, spreading of diseases, etc.) would be connected with such Decision Arenas for the purpose of visualization, in order to make complex interdependencies understandable to scientists, decision-makers, and the general public.',

	{'abstract': u'We consider lattice tilings of by a shape we call a -quasi-cross. Such lattices form perfect error-correcting codes which correct a single limited-magnitude error with prescribed maximal-magnitudes of positive error and negative error (the ratio of which is called the balance ratio). These codes can be used to correct both disturb and retention errors in flash memories, which are characterized by having limited magnitudes and different signs. We construct infinite families of perfect codes for any rational balance ratio, and provide a specific construction for -quasi-cross lattice tiling. The constructions are related to group splitting and modular sequences. We also study bounds on the parameters of lattice-tilings by quasi-crosses, connecting the arm lengths of the quasi-crosses and the dimension. We also prove constraints on group splitting, a specific case of which shows that the parameters of the lattice tiling of -quasi-crosses is the only ones possible.',

	{'abstract': u'We prove several decidability and undecidability results for nu-PN, an extension of P/T nets with pure name creation and name management. We give a simple proof of undecidability of reachability, by reducing reachability in nets with inhibitor arcs to it. Thus, the expressive power of nu-PN strictly surpasses that of P/T nets. We prove that nu-PN are Well Structured Transition Systems. In particular, we obtain decidability of coverability and termination, so that the expressive power of Turing machines is not reached. Moreover, they are strictly Well Structured, so that the boundedness problem is also decidable. We consider two properties, width-boundedness and depth-boundedness, that factorize boundedness. Width-boundedness has already been proven to be decidable. We prove here undecidability of depth-boundedness. Finally, we obtain Ackermann-hardness results for all our decidable decision problems.',

Four examples are included: in the first case, the synthesis of a mechanism for hybrid-tasks, considering path generation, function generation, and motion generation, is carried out. The second and third cases pertain to path generation, with and without prescribed timing. Finally, the synthesis of an Ackerman mechanism is reported. Order defect problem is solved by manipulating individuals instead of penalizing or discretizing the search space for the parameters. A technique that consists in applying a transformation in order to satisfy the Grashof and crank conditions to generate an initial elitist population is introduced. As a result, the evolutionary algorithm increases its efficiency.',

	{'abstract': u'This paper introduces a novel method for compact representation of sets of n-dimensional binary sequences in a form of compact triplets structures (CTS), supposing both logic and arithmetic interpretations of data. Suitable illustration of CTS application is the unique graph-combinatorial model for the classic intractable 3-Satisfiability problem and a polynomial algorithm for the model synthesis. The method used for Boolean formulas analysis and classification by means of the model is defined as a bijective mapping principle for sets of components of discordant structures to a basic set. The statistic computer-aided experiment showed efficiency of the algorithm in a large scale of problem dimension parameters, including those that make enumeration procedures of no use. The formulated principle expands resources of constructive approach to investigation of intractable problems.',

	{'abstract': u'Motivated by the desire to cope with data imprecision, we study methods for taking advantage of preliminary information about point sets in order to speed up the computation of certain structures associated with them. In particular, we study the following problem: given a set L of n lines in the plane, we wish to preprocess L such that later, upon receiving a set P of n points, each of which lies on a distinct line of L, we can construct the convex hull of P efficiently. We show that in quadratic time and space it is possible to construct a data structure on L that enables us to compute the convex hull of any such point set P in O(n alpha(n) log* n) expected time. If we further assume that the points are "oblivious" with respect to the data structure, the running time improves to O(n alpha(n)). The analysis applies almost verbatim when L is a set of line-segments, and yields similar asymptotic bounds. We present several extensions, including a trade-off between space and query time and an output-sensitive algorithm. We also study the "dual problem" where we show how to efficiently compute the (&lt;= k)-level of n lines in the plane, each of which lies on a distinct point (given in advance). We complement our results by Omega(n log n) lower bounds under the algebraic computation tree model for several related problems, including sorting a set of points (according to, say, their x-order), each of which lies on a given line known in advance. Therefore, the convex hull problem under our setting is easier than sorting, contrary to the "standard" convex hull and sorting problems, in which the two problems require Theta(n log n) steps in the worst case (under the algebraic computation tree model).',

Synthesis of rather simple behaviors such as collision avoidance by applying artificial evolution has been shown multiple times. However, the difficulty of this synthesis increases heavily with increasing complexity of the task that should be performed by the robot. We try to tackle this problem of complexity with Artificial Homeostatic Hormone Systems (AHHS), which provide both intrinsic, homeostatic processes and (transient) intrinsic, variant behavior. By using AHHS the need for pre-defined controller topologies or information about the field of application is minimized. We investigate how the principle design of the controller and the hormone network size affects the overall performance of the artificial evolution (i.e., evolvability). This is done by comparing two variants of AHHS that show different effects when mutated. We evolve a controller for a robot built from five autonomous, cooperating modules. The desired behavior is a form of gait resulting in fast locomotion by using the modules' main hinges.",

	{'abstract': u'Theoretical progress in understanding the dynamics of spreading processes on graphs suggests the existence of an epidemic threshold below which no epidemics form and above which epidemics spread to a significant fraction of the graph. We have observed information cascades on the social media site Digg that spread fast enough for one initial spreader to infect hundreds of people, yet end up affecting only 0.1% of the entire network. We find that two effects, previously studied in isolation, combine cooperatively to drastically limit the final size of cascades on Digg. First, because of the highly clustered structure of the Digg network, most people who are aware of a story have been exposed to it via multiple friends. This structure lowers the epidemic threshold while moderately slowing the overall growth of cascades. In addition, we find that the mechanism for social contagion on Digg points to a fundamental difference between information spread and other contagion processes: despite multiple opportunities for infection within a social group, people are less likely to become spreaders of information with repeated exposure. The consequences of this mechanism become more pronounced for more clustered graphs. Ultimately, this effect severely curtails the size of social epidemics on Digg.',

In this second part of the paper, we build upon our previous understanding of the single AP network, and formulate the joint spectrum decision and spectrum sharing problem in a multiple AP network into a non-cooperative game, in which the feasible strategy of a player contains a discrete variable (the AP/spectrum decision) and a continuous vector (the power allocation among multiple channels). The structure of the game is hence very different from most non-cooperative spectrum management game proposed in the literature. We provide characterization of the Nash Equilibrium (NE) of this game, and present a set of novel algorithms that allow the CUs to distributively and efficiently select the suitable AP and share the channels with other CUs.

By enabling nodes to detect malicious behaviors probabilistically and use overheard messages to police their downstream neighbors locally, the algebraic watchdog delivers a secure global self-checking network. Unlike traditional Byzantine detection protocols which are receiver-based, this protocol gives the senders an active role in checking the node downstream. The key idea is inspired by Marti et al.'s watchdog-pathrater, which attempts to detect and mitigate the effects of routing misbehavior. As an initial building block of a such system, we first focus on a two-hop network. We present a graphical model to understand the inference process nodes execute to police their downstream neighbors; as well as to compute, analyze, and approximate the probabilities of misdetection and false detection. In addition, we present an algebraic analysis of the performance using an hypothesis testing framework that provides exact formulae for probabilities of false detection and misdetection. We then extend the algebraic watchdog to a more general network setting, and propose a protocol in which we can establish trust in coded systems in a distributed manner. We develop a graphical model to detect the presence of an adversarial node downstream within a general multi-hop network. The structure of the graphical model (a trellis) lends itself to well-known algorithms, such as the Viterbi algorithm, which can compute the probabilities of misdetection and false detection. We show analytically that as long as the min-cut is not dominated by the Byzantine adversaries, upstream nodes can monitor downstream neighbors and allow reliable communication with certain probability. Finally, we present simulation results that support our analysis.",

	{'abstract': u'The convergence properties of the Iterative water-filling (IWF) based algorithms have been derived in the ideal situation where the transmitters in the network are able to obtain the exact value of the interference plus noise (IPN) experienced at the corresponding receivers in each iteration of the algorithm. However, these algorithms are not robust because they diverge when there is it time-varying estimation error of the IPN, a situation that arises in real communication system. In this correspondence, we propose an algorithm that possesses convergence guarantees in the presence of various forms of such time-varying error. Moreover, we also show by simulation that in scenarios where the interference is strong, the conventional IWF diverges while our proposed algorithm still converges.',

	{'abstract': u'This paper studies the capacity of single-source single-sink noiseless networks under adversarial or arbitrary errors on no more than z edges. Unlike prior papers, which assume equal capacities on all links, arbitrary link capacities are considered. Results include new upper bounds, network error correction coding strategies, and examples of network families where our bounds are tight. An example is provided of a network where the capacity is 50% greater than the best rate that can be achieved with linear coding. While coding at the source and sink suffices in networks with equal link capacities, in networks with unequal link capacities, it is shown that intermediate nodes may have to do coding, nonlinear error detection, or error correction in order to achieve the network error correction capacity.',

	{'abstract': u'Spectrum management has been identified as a crucial step towards enabling the technology of a cognitive radio network (CRN). Most of the current works dealing with spectrum management in the CRN focus on a single task of the problem, e.g., spectrum sensing, spectrum decision, spectrum sharing or spectrum mobility. In this two-part paper, we argue that for certain network configurations, jointly performing several tasks of the spectrum management improves the spectrum efficiency. Specifically, our aim is to study the uplink resource management problem in a CRN where there exist multiple cognitive users (CUs) and access points (APs). The CUs, in order to maximize their uplink transmission rates, have to associate to a suitable AP (spectrum decision), and to share the channels used by this AP with other CUs (spectrum sharing). These tasks are clearly interdependent, and the problem of how they should be carried out efficiently and in a distributed manner is still open in the literature.',

	{'abstract': u'This paper focuses on two-cell multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) Gaussian interfering broadcast channels (MIMO-IFBC) with cooperating users on the cell-boundary of each BS. It corresponds to a downlink scenario for cellular networks with two base stations (BSs), and users equipped with Wi-Fi interfaces enabling to cooperate among users on a peer-to-peer basis. In this scenario, we propose a novel interference alignment (IA) technique exploiting user cooperation. Our proposed algorithm obtains the achievable degrees of freedom (DoF) of 2K when each BS and user have transmit antennas and receive antennas, respectively. Furthermore, the algorithm requires only a small amount of channel feedback information with the aid of the user cooperation channels. The simulations demonstrate that not only are the analytical results valid, but the achievable DoF of our proposed algorithm also outperforms those of conventional techniques.',

	{'abstract': u'This paper introduces a simple and very general theory of compressive sensing. In this theory, the sensing mechanism simply selects sensing vectors independently at random from a probability distribution F; it includes all models - e.g. Gaussian, frequency measurements - discussed in the literature, but also provides a framework for new measurement strategies as well. We prove that if the probability distribution F obeys a simple incoherence property and an isotropy property, one can faithfully recover approximately sparse signals from a minimal number of noisy measurements. The novelty is that our recovery results do not require the restricted isometry property (RIP) - they make use of a much weaker notion - or a random model for the signal. As an example, the paper shows that a signal with s nonzero entries can be faithfully recovered from about s log n Fourier coefficients that are contaminated with noise.',

Both cosine-normalization (bottom up) and factor analysis (top down) suggest a division into approximately twelve subsets. The relations among these subsets are explored using various visualization techniques. However, we were not able to retrieve this structure using the ISI Subject Categories, including the 25 categories which are specific to the A&amp;HCI.

	{'abstract': u'In this paper we introduce the olog, or ontology log, a category-theoretic model for knowledge representation (KR). Grounded in formal mathematics, ologs can be rigorously formulated and cross-compared in ways that other KR models (such as semantic networks) cannot. An olog is similar to a relational database schema; in fact an olog can serve as a data repository if desired. Unlike database schemas, which are generally difficult to create or modify, ologs are designed to be user-friendly enough that authoring or reconfiguring an olog is a matter of course rather than a difficult chore. It is hoped that learning to author ologs is much simpler than learning a database definition language, despite their similarity. We describe ologs carefully and illustrate with many examples. As an application we show that any primitive recursive function can be described by an olog. We also show that ologs can be aligned or connected together into a larger network using functors. The various methods of information flow and institutions can then be used to integrate local and global world-views. We finish by providing several different avenues for future research.',

	{'abstract': u"A celebrated theorem of Savitch states that NSPACE(S) is contained in DSPACE(S^2). In particular, Savitch gave a deterministic algorithm to solve ST-CONNECTIVITY (an NL-complete problem) using O(log^2) space, implying NL is in DSPACE(log^2). While Savitch's theorem itself has not been improved in the last four decades, studying the space complexity of several special cases of ST-CONNECTIVITY has provided new insights into the space-bounded complexity classes. In this paper, we introduce new kind of graph connectivity problems which we call graph realizability problems. All of our graph realizability problems are generalizations of UNDIRECTED ST-CONNECTIVITY. ST-REALIZABILITY, the most general graph realizability problem, is LogCFL-complete. We define the corresponding complexity classes that lie between L and LogCFL and study their relationships. As special cases of our graph realizability problems we define two natural problems, BALANCED ST-CONNECTIVITY and POSITIVE BALANCED ST-CONNECTIVITY, that lie between L and NL. We present a deterministic O(lognloglogn) space algorithm for BALANCED ST-CONNECTIVITY. More generally we prove that SGSLogCFL, a generalization of BALANCED ST-CONNECTIVITY, is contained in DSPACE(lognloglogn). To achieve this goal we generalize several concepts (such as graph squaring and transitive closure) and algorithms (such as parallel algorithms) known in the context of UNDIRECTED ST-CONNECTIVITY.",

	{'abstract': u'We present a complete characterization of shortest paths to a goal position for a vehicle with unicycle kinematics and a limited range sensor, constantly keeping a given landmark in sight. Previous work on this subject studied the optimal paths in case of a frontal, symmetrically limited Field--Of--View (FOV). In this paper we provide a generalization to the case of arbitrary FOVs, including the case that the direction of motion is not an axis of symmetry for the FOV, and even that it is not contained in the FOV. The provided solution is of particular relevance to applications using side-scanning, such as e.g. in underwater sonar-based surveying and navigation.',

	{'abstract': u'Given a metric space on n points, an -approximate universal algorithm for the Steiner tree problem outputs a distribution over rooted spanning trees such that for any subset X of vertices containing the root, the expected cost of the induced subtree is within an factor of the optimal Steiner tree cost for X. An -approximate differentially private algorithm for the Steiner tree problem takes as input a subset X of vertices, and outputs a tree distribution that induces a solution within an factor of the optimal as before, and satisfies the additional property that for any set X\' that differs in a single vertex from X, the tree distributions for X and X\' are "close" to each other. Universal and differentially private algorithms for TSP are defined similarly. An -approximate universal algorithm for the Steiner tree problem or TSP is also an -approximate differentially private algorithm. It is known that both problems admit O(logn)-approximate universal algorithms, and hence O(log n)-approximate differentially private algorithms as well. We prove an (logn) lower bound on the approximation ratio achievable for the universal Steiner tree problem and the universal TSP, matching the known upper bounds. Our lower bound for the Steiner tree problem holds even when the algorithm is allowed to output a more general solution of a distribution on paths to the root.',

	{'abstract': u'A plausible definition of "reasoning" could be "algebraically manipulating previously acquired knowledge in order to answer a new question". This definition covers first-order logical inference or probabilistic inference. It also includes much simpler manipulations commonly used to build large learning systems. For instance, we can build an optical character recognition system by first training a character segmenter, an isolated character recognizer, and a language model, using appropriate labeled training sets. Adequately concatenating these modules and fine tuning the resulting system can be viewed as an algebraic operation in a space of models. The resulting model answers a new question, that is, converting the image of a text page into a computer readable text. This observation suggests a conceptual continuity between algebraically rich inference systems, such as logical or probabilistic inference, and simple manipulations, such as the mere concatenation of trainable learning systems. Therefore, instead of trying to bridge the gap between machine learning systems and sophisticated "all-purpose" inference mechanisms, we can instead algebraically enrich the set of manipulations applicable to training systems, and build reasoning capabilities from the ground up.',

We introduce an extensible framework that will enable the real-time analysis of meme diffusion in social media by mining, visualizing, mapping, classifying, and modeling massive streams of public microblogging events. We describe a Web service that leverages this framework to track political memes in Twitter and help detect astroturfing, smear campaigns, and other misinformation in the context of U.S. political elections. We present some cases of abusive behaviors uncovered by our service. Finally, we discuss promising preliminary results on the detection of suspicious memes via supervised learning based on features extracted from the topology of the diffusion networks, sentiment analysis, and crowdsourced annotations.',

	{'abstract': u'PDM Systems contain and manage heavy amount of data but the search mechanism of most of the systems is not intelligent which can process user"s natural language based queries to extract desired information. Currently available search mechanisms in almost all of the PDM systems are not very efficient and based on old ways of searching information by entering the relevant information to the respective fields of search forms to find out some specific information from attached repositories. Targeting this issue, a thorough research was conducted in fields of PDM Systems and Language Technology. Concerning the PDM System, conducted research provides the information about PDM and PDM Systems in detail. Concerning the field of Language Technology, helps in implementing a search mechanism for PDM Systems to search user"s needed information by analyzing user"s natural language based requests. The accomplished goal of this research was to support the field of PDM with a new proposition of a conceptual model for the implementation of natural language based search. The proposed conceptual model is successfully designed and partially implementation in the form of a prototype. Describing the proposition in detail the main concept, implementation designs and developed prototype of proposed approach is discussed in this paper. Implemented prototype is compared with respective functions of existing PDM systems .i.e., Windchill and CIM to evaluate its effectiveness against targeted challenges.',

	{'abstract': u'We present a new lossy compressor for discrete-valued sources. For coding a sequence , the encoder starts by assigning a certain cost to each possible reconstruction sequence. It then finds the one that minimizes this cost and describes it losslessly to the decoder via a universal lossless compressor. The cost of each sequence is a linear combination of its distance from the sequence and a linear function of its order empirical distribution. The structure of the cost function allows the encoder to employ the Viterbi algorithm to recover the minimizer of the cost. We identify a choice of the coefficients comprising the linear function of the empirical distribution used in the cost function which ensures that the algorithm universally achieves the optimum rate-distortion performance of any stationary ergodic source in the limit of large , provided that diverges as . Iterative techniques for approximating the coefficients, which alleviate the computational burden of finding the optimal coefficients, are proposed and studied.',

	{'abstract': u"We present a new threshold phenomenon in data structure lower bounds where slightly reduced update times lead to exploding query times. Consider incremental connectivity, letting t_u be the time to insert an edge and t_q be the query time. For t_u = Omega(t_q), the problem is equivalent to the well-understood union-find problem: InsertEdge(s,t) can be implemented by Union(Find(s), Find(t)). This gives worst-case time t_u = t_q = O(lg n / lglg n) and amortized t_u = t_q = O(alpha(n)). By contrast, we show that if t_u = o(lg n / lglg n), the query time explodes to t_q &gt;= n^. In other words, if the data structure doesn't have time to find the roots of each disjoint set (tree) during edge insertion, there is no effective way to organize the information! For amortized complexity, we demonstrate a new inverse-Ackermann type trade-off in the regime t_u = o(t_q). A similar lower bound is given for fully dynamic connectivity, where an update time of o( lg n) forces the query time to be n^. This lower bound allows for amortization and Las Vegas randomization, and comes close to the known O(lg n * poly(lglg n)) upper bound.",

	{'abstract': u'This paper provides a comprehensive review of the domain of physical layer security in multiuser wireless networks. The essential premise of physical-layer security is to enable the exchange of confidential messages over a wireless medium in the presence of unauthorized eavesdroppers without relying on higher-layer encryption. This can be achieved primarily in two ways: without the need for a secret key by intelligently designing transmit coding strategies, or by exploiting the wireless communication medium to develop secret keys over public channels. The survey begins with an overview of the foundations dating back to the pioneering work of Shannon and Wyner on information-theoretic security. We then describe the evolution of secure transmission strategies from point-to-point channels to multiple-antenna systems, followed by generalizations to multiuser broadcast, multiple-access, interference, and relay networks. Secret-key generation and establishment protocols based on physical layer mechanisms are subsequently covered. Approaches for secrecy based on channel coding design are then examined, along with a description of inter-disciplinary approaches based on game theory and stochastic geometry. The associated problem of physical-layer message authentication is also introduced briefly. The survey concludes with observations on potential research directions in this area.',

	{'abstract': u'Problems related to network coding for acyclic, instantaneous networks (where the edges of the acyclic graph representing the network are assumed to have zero-delay) have been extensively dealt with in the recent past. The most prominent of these problems include (a) the existence of network codes that achieve maximum rate of transmission, (b) efficient network code constructions, and (c) field size issues. In practice, however, networks have transmission delays. In network coding theory, such networks with transmission delays are generally abstracted by assuming that their edges have integer delays. Note that using enough memory at the nodes of an acyclic network with integer delays can effectively simulate instantaneous behavior, which is probably why only acyclic instantaneous networks have been primarily focused on thus far. In this work, we elaborate on issues ((a), (b) and (c) above) related to network coding for acyclic networks with integer delays, which have till now mostly been overlooked. We show that the delays associated with the edges of the network cannot be ignored, and in fact turn out to be advantageous, disadvantageous or immaterial, depending on the topology of the network and the problem considered i.e., (a), (b) or (c). In the process, we also show that for a single source multicast problem in acyclic networks (instantaneous and with delays), the network coding operations at each node can simply be limited to storing old symbols and coding them over a binary field. Therefore, operations over elements of larger fields are unnecessary in the network, the trade-off being that enough memory exists at the nodes and at the sinks, and that the sinks have more processing power.',

	{'abstract': u'Recently, considerable research efforts have been devoted to the design of methods to learn from data overcomplete dictionaries for sparse coding. However, learned dictionaries require the solution of an optimization problem for coding new data. In order to overcome this drawback, we propose an algorithm aimed at learning both a dictionary and its dual: a linear mapping directly performing the coding. By leveraging on proximal methods, our algorithm jointly minimizes the reconstruction error of the dictionary and the coding error of its dual; the sparsity of the representation is induced by an -based penalty on its coefficients. The results obtained on synthetic data and real images show that the algorithm is capable of recovering the expected dictionaries. Furthermore, on a benchmark dataset, we show that the image features obtained from the dual matrix yield state-of-the-art classification performance while being much less computational intensive.',

	{'abstract': u'This paper aims to identify whether different weighted PageRank algorithms can be applied to author citation networks to measure the popularity and prestige of a scholar from a citation perspective. Information Retrieval (IR) was selected as a test field and data from 1956-2008 were collected from Web of Science (WOS). Weighted PageRank with citation and publication as weighted vectors were calculated on author citation networks. The results indicate that both popularity rank and prestige rank were highly correlated with the weighted PageRank. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was conducted to detect relationships among these different measures. For capturing prize winners within the IR field, prestige rank outperformed all the other measures.',

	{'abstract': u'A mobile ad hoc network (MANET), is a self-configuring network of mobile devices connected by wireless links. In order to achieve stable clusters, the cluster-heads maintaining the cluster should be stable with minimum overhead of cluster re-elections. In this paper we propose a Probability Based Adaptive Invoked Weighted Clustering Algorithm (PAIWCA) which can enhance the stability of the clusters by taking battery power of the nodes into considerations for the clustering formation and electing stable cluster-heads using cluster head probability of a node. In this simulation study a comparison was conducted to measure the performance of our algorithm with maximal weighted independent set (MWIS) in terms of the number of clusters formed, the connectivity of the network, dominant set updates,throughput of the overall network and packet delivery ratio. The result shows that our algorithm performs better than existing one and is also tunable to different kinds of network conditions.',

	{'abstract': u'Under what conditions is an edge present in a social network at time t likely to decay or persist by some future time t + Delta(t)? Previous research addressing this issue suggests that the network range of the people involved in the edge, the extent to which the edge is embedded in a surrounding structure, and the age of the edge all play a role in edge decay. This paper uses weighted data from a large-scale social network built from cell-phone calls in an 8-week period to determine the importance of edge weight for the decay/persistence process. In particular, we study the relative predictive power of directed weight, embeddedness, newness, and range (measured as outdegree) with respect to edge decay and assess the effectiveness with which a simple decision tree and logistic regression classifier can accurately predict whether an edge that was active in one time period continues to be so in a future time period. We find that directed edge weight, weighted reciprocity and time-dependent measures of edge longevity are highly predictive of whether we classify an edge as persistent or decayed, relative to the other types of factors at the dyad and neighborhood level.',

	{'abstract': u'In this work, we study the performance of random isometric precoders over quasi-static and correlated fading channels. We derive deterministic approximations of the mutual information and the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) at the output of the minimum-mean-square-error (MMSE) receiver and provide simple provably converging fixed-point algorithms for their computation. Although these approximations are only proven exact in the asymptotic regime with infinitely many antennas at the transmitters and receivers, simulations suggest that they closely match the performance of small-dimensional systems. We exemplarily apply our results to the performance analysis of multi-cellular communication systems, multiple-input multiple-output multiple-access channels (MIMO-MAC), and MIMO interference channels. The mathematical analysis is based on the Stieltjes transform method. This enables the derivation of deterministic equivalents of functionals of large-dimensional random matrices. In contrast to previous works, our analysis does not rely on arguments from free probability theory which enables the consideration of random matrix models for which asymptotic freeness does not hold. Thus, the results of this work are also a novel contribution to the field of random matrix theory and applicable to a wide spectrum of practical systems.',

	{'abstract': u'SBV is a deep inference system that extends the set of logical operators of multiplicative linear logic with the non commutative operator Seq. We introduce the logical system SBVr which extends SBV by adding a self-dual atom-renaming operator to it. We prove that the cut elimination holds on SBVr. SBVr and its cut free subsystem BVr are complete and sound with respect to linear lambda calculus with explicit substitutions. Under any strategy, a sequence of evaluation steps of any linear lambda-term M becomes a process of proof-search in SBVr (BVr) once M is mapped into a formula of SBVr. Completeness and soundness follow from simulating linear beta-reduction with explicit substitutions as processes. The role of the new renaming operator of SBVr is to rename channel-names on-demand. This simulates the substitution that occurs in a beta-reduction. Despite SBVr is a minimal extension of SBV its proof-search can compute all boolean functions, as linear lambda-calculus with explicit substitutions can compute all boolean functions as well. So, proof search of SBVr and BVr is at least ptime-complete.',

	{'abstract': u'Self-stabilizing systems have the ability to converge to a correct behavior when started in any configuration. Most of the work done so far in the self-stabilization area assumed either communication via shared memory or via FIFO channels. This paper is the first to lay the bases for the design of self-stabilizing message passing algorithms over unreliable non-FIFO channels. We propose a fault-send-deliver optimal stabilizing data-link layer that emulates a reliable FIFO communication channel over unreliable capacity bounded non-FIFO channels.',

	{'abstract': u'We investigate the recovery of signals exhibiting a sparse representation in a general (i.e., possibly redundant or incomplete) dictionary that are corrupted by additive noise admitting a sparse representation in another general dictionary. This setup covers a wide range of applications, such as image inpainting, super-resolution, signal separation, and recovery of signals that are impaired by, e.g., clipping, impulse noise, or narrowband interference. We present deterministic recovery guarantees based on a novel uncertainty relation for pairs of general dictionaries and we provide corresponding practicable recovery algorithms. The recovery guarantees we find depend on the signal and noise sparsity levels, on the coherence parameters of the involved dictionaries, and on the amount of prior knowledge about the signal and noise support sets.',

	{'abstract': u'The Resource Description Framework (RDF) provides a common data model for the integration of "real-time" social and sensor data streams with the Web and with each other. While there exist numerous protocols and data formats for exchanging dynamic RDF data, or RDF updates, these options should be examined carefully in order to enable a Semantic Web equivalent of the high-throughput, low-latency streams of typical Web 2.0, multimedia, and gaming applications. This paper contains a brief survey of RDF update formats and a high-level discussion of both TCP and UDP-based transport protocols for updates. Its main contribution is the experimental evaluation of a UDP-based architecture which serves as a real-world example of a high-performance RDF streaming application in an Internet-scale distributed environment.',

	{'abstract': u'In order to provide high data reliability, distributed storage systems disperse data with redundancy to multiple storage nodes. Regenerating codes is a new class of erasure codes to introduce redundancy for the purpose of improving the data repair performance in distributed storage. Most of the studies on regenerating codes focus on the single-failure recovery, but it is not uncommon to see two or more node failures at the same time in large storage networks. To exploit the opportunity of repairing multiple failed nodes simultaneously, a cooperative repair mechanism, in the sense that the nodes to be repaired can exchange data among themselves, is investigated. A lower bound on the repair-bandwidth for cooperative repair is derived and a construction of a family of exact cooperative regenerating codes matching this lower bound is presented.',

	{'abstract': u'It was shown recently that CSMA (Carrier Sense Multiple Access)-like distributed algorithms can achieve the maximal throughput in wireless networks (and task processing networks) under certain assumptions. One important, but idealized assumption is that the sensing time is negligible, so that there is no collision. In this paper, we study more practical CSMA-based scheduling algorithms with collisions. First, we provide a Markov chain model and give an explicit throughput formula which takes into account the cost of collisions and overhead. The formula has a simple form since the Markov chain is "almost" time-reversible. Second, we propose transmission-length control algorithms to approach throughput optimality in this case. Sufficient conditions are given to ensure the convergence and stability of the proposed algorithms. Finally, we characterize the relationship between the CSMA parameters (such as the maximum packet lengths) and the achievable capacity region.',

	{'abstract': u'In this paper, we perform a cost-benefit analysis of multiuser diversity in single antenna broadcast channels. It is well known that multiuser diversity can be beneficial but there is a significant cost associated with acquiring instantaneous CSI. We perform a cost-benefit analysis of multiuser diversity for 2 types of CSI feedback methods, dedicated feedback and SNR dependent feedback, quantifying how many users should feedback CSI from a net throughput perspective. Dedicated feedback, in which orthogonal resources are allocated to each user, has significant feedback cost and this limits the amount of available multiuser diversity that can be used. SNR dependent feedback method, in which only users with SNR above a threshold attempt to feedback, has relatively much smaller feedback cost and this allows for all of the available multiuser diversity to be used. Next, we study the effect of single user multiantenna techniques, which reduce the SNR variation, on the number of feedback users neccessary. It is seen that a broadcast channel using single user multiantenna techniques should reduce the number of feedback users with the spatial dimension.',

	{'abstract': u'This paper studies the provision of a wireless network by a monopolistic provider who may be either benevolent (seeking to maximize social welfare) or selfish (seeking to maximize provider profit). The paper addresses questions that do not seem to have been studied before in the engineering literature on wireless networks: Under what circumstances is it feasible for a provider, either benevolent or selfish, to operate a network in such a way as to cover costs? How is the optimal behavior of a benevolent provider different from the optimal behavior of a selfish provider, and how does this difference affect social welfare? And, most importantly, how does the medium access control (MAC) technology influence the answers to these questions? To address these questions, we build a general model, and provide analysis and simulations for simplified but typical scenarios; the focus in these scenarios is on the contrast between the outcomes obtained under carrier-sensing multiple access (CSMA) and outcomes obtained under time-division multiple access (TDMA). Simulation results demonstrate that differences in MAC technology can have a significant effect on social welfare, on provider profit, and even on the (financial) feasibility of a wireless network.',

	{'abstract': u'How does information flow in online social networks? How does the structure and size of the information cascade evolve in time? How can we efficiently mine the information contained in cascade dynamics? We approach these questions empirically and present an efficient and scalable mathematical framework for quantitative analysis of cascades on networks. We define a cascade generating function that captures the details of the microscopic dynamics of the cascades. We show that this function can also be used to compute the macroscopic properties of cascades, such as their size, spread, diameter, number of paths, and average path length. We present an algorithm to efficiently compute cascade generating function and demonstrate that while significantly compressing information within a cascade, it nevertheless allows us to accurately reconstruct its structure. We use this framework to study information dynamics on the social network of Digg. Digg allows users to post and vote on stories, and easily see the stories that friends have voted on. As a story spreads on Digg through voting, it generates cascades. We extract cascades of more than 3,500 Digg stories and calculate their macroscopic and microscopic properties. We identify several trends in cascade dynamics: spreading via chaining, branching and community. We discuss how these affect the spread of the story through the Digg social network. Our computational framework is general and offers a practical solution to quantitative analysis of the microscopic structure of even very large cascades.',

Till date, there is no well known graph class of unbounded boxicity for which even an -factor approximation algorithm for computing boxicity is known, for any . In this paper, we study the boxicity problem on Circular Arc graphs - intersection graphs of arcs of a circle. We give a -factor polynomial time approximation algorithm for computing the boxicity of any circular arc graph along with a corresponding box representation, where is its boxicity. For Normal Circular Arc(NCA) graphs, with an NCA model given, this can be improved to an additive 2-factor approximation algorithm. The time complexity of the algorithms to approximately compute the boxicity is in both these cases and in time we also get their corresponding box representations, where is the number of vertices of the graph and is its number of edges. The additive 2-factor algorithm directly works for any Proper Circular Arc graph, since computing an NCA model for it can be done in polynomial time.',

	{'abstract': u'Learning structured representations has emerged as an important problem in many domains, including document and Web data mining, bioinformatics, and image analysis. One approach to learning complex structures is to integrate many smaller, incomplete and noisy structure fragments. In this work, we present an unsupervised probabilistic approach that extends affinity propagation to combine the small ontological fragments into a collection of integrated, consistent, and larger folksonomies. This is a challenging task because the method must aggregate similar structures while avoiding structural inconsistencies and handling noise. We validate the approach on a real-world social media dataset, comprised of shallow personal hierarchies specified by many individual users, collected from the photosharing website Flickr. Our empirical results show that our proposed approach is able to construct deeper and denser structures, compared to an approach using only the standard affinity propagation algorithm. Additionally, the approach yields better overall integration quality than a state-of-the-art approach based on incremental relational clustering.',

	{'abstract': u'We consider a multi-location inventory system where inventory choices at each location are centrally coordinated. Lateral transshipments are allowed as recourse actions within the same echelon in the inventory system to reduce costs and improve service level. However, this transshipment process usually causes undesirable lead times. In this paper, we propose a multiobjective model of the multi-location transshipment problem which addresses optimizing three conflicting objectives: (1) minimizing the aggregate expected cost, (2) maximizing the expected fill rate, and (3) minimizing the expected transshipment lead times. We apply an evolutionary multiobjective optimization approach using the strength Pareto evolutionary algorithm (SPEA2), to approximate the optimal Pareto front. Simulation with a wide choice of model parameters shows the different trades-off between the conflicting objectives.',

	{'abstract': u"This paper introduces a network coding-based protection scheme against single and multiple link failures. The proposed strategy ensures that in a connection, each node receives two copies of the same data unit: one copy on the working circuit, and a second copy that can be extracted from linear combinations of data units transmitted on a shared protection path. This guarantees instantaneous recovery of data units upon the failure of a working circuit. The strategy can be implemented at an overlay layer, which makes its deployment simple and scalable. While the proposed strategy is similar in spirit to the work of Kamal '07 &amp; '10, there are significant differences. In particular, it provides protection against multiple link failures. The new scheme is simpler, less expensive, and does not require the synchronization required by the original scheme. The sharing of the protection circuit by a number of connections is the key to the reduction of the cost of protection. The paper also conducts a comparison of the cost of the proposed scheme to the 1+1 and shared backup path protection (SBPP) strategies, and establishes the benefits of our strategy.",

	{'abstract': u'In recent years, reversible data hiding has attracted much more attention than before. Reversibility signifies that the original media can be recovered without any loss from the marked media after extracting the embedded message. This paper presents a new method that adopts two-level wavelet transform and exploits the feature of large wavelet coefficient variance to achieve the goal of high capacity with imperceptibility. Our method differs from those of previous ones in which the wavelet coefficients histogram not gray-level histogram is manipulated. Besides, clever shifting rules are introduced into histogram to avoid the decimal problem in pixel values after recovery to achieve reversibility. With small alteration of the wavelet coefficients in the embedding process, and therefore low visual distortion is obtained in the marked image. In addition, an important feature of our design is that the use of threshold is much different from previous studies. The results indicate that our design is superior to many other state-of-the-art reversible data hiding schemes.',

Matrix truncation (element dropping) is compared to SpAMM for quantum chemical matrices with approximate exponential and algebraic decay. For matched errors in the electronic total energy, SpAMM is found to require fewer to far fewer floating point operations relative to dropping.

	{'abstract': u'Empirical data shows that in the absence of incentives, a peer participating in a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) network wishes to free-riding. Most solutions for providing incentives in P2P networks are based on direct reciprocity, which are not appropriate for most P2P multimedia sharing networks due to the unique features exhibited by such networks: large populations of anonymous agents interacting infrequently, asymmetric interests of peers, network errors, and multiple concurrent transactions. In this paper, we design and rigorously analyze a new family of incentive protocols that utilizes indirect reciprocity which is based on the design of efficient social norms. In the proposed P2P protocols, the social norms consist of a social strategy, which represents the rule prescribing to the peers when they should or should not provide content to other peers, and a reputation scheme, which rewards or punishes peers depending on whether they comply or not with the social strategy. We first define the concept of a sustainable social norm, under which no peer has an incentive to deviate. We then formulate the problem of designing optimal social norms, which selects the social norm that maximizes the network performance among all sustainable social norms. Hence, we prove that it becomes in the self-interest of peers to contribute their content to the network rather than to free-ride. We also investigate the impact of various punishment schemes on the social welfare as well as how should the optimal social norms be designed if altruistic and malicious peers are active in the network. Our results show that optimal social norms are capable of providing significant improvements in the sharing efficiency of multimedia P2P networks.',

	{'abstract': u"To reduce computational complexity and delay in randomized network coded content distribution, and for some other practical reasons, coding is not performed simultaneously over all content blocks, but over much smaller, possibly overlapping subsets of these blocks, known as generations. A penalty of this strategy is throughput reduction. To analyze the throughput loss, we model coding over generations with random generation scheduling as a coupon collector's brotherhood problem. This model enables us to derive the expected number of coded packets needed for successful decoding of the entire content as well as the probability of decoding failure (the latter only when generations do not overlap) and further, to quantify the tradeoff between computational complexity and throughput. Interestingly, with a moderate increase in the generation size, throughput quickly approaches link capacity. Overlaps between generations can further improve throughput substantially for relatively small generation sizes.",

	{'abstract': u'An achievable rate region is obtained for a primary multiple access network coexisting with a secondary link of one transmitter and a corresponding receiver. The rate region depicts the sum primary rate versus the secondary rate and is established assuming that the secondary link performs rate-splitting. The achievable rate region is the union of two types of achievable rate regions. The first type is a rate region established assuming that the secondary receiver cannot decode any primary signal, whereas the second is established assuming that the secondary receiver can decode the signal of one primary receiver. The achievable rate region is determined first assuming discrete memoryless channel (DMC) then the results are applied to a Gaussian channel. In the Gaussian channel, the performance of rate-splitting is characterized for the two types of rate regions. Moreover, a necessary and sufficient condition to determine which primary signal that the secondary receiver can decode without degrading the range of primary achievable sum rates is provided. When this condition is satisfied by a certain primary user, the secondary receiver can decode its signal and achieve larger rates without reducing the primary achievable sum rates from the case in which it does not decode any primary signal. It is also shown that, the probability of having at least one primary user satisfying this condition grows with the primary signal to noise ratio.',

	{'abstract': u'Suppose we have just performed searches in a self-index for two patterns and and now we want to search for their concatenation A B); how can we best make use of our previous computations? In this paper we consider this problem and, more generally, how we can store a dynamic library of patterns that we can easily manipulate in interesting ways. We give a space- and time-efficient data structure for this problem that is compatible with many of the best self-indexes.',

	{'abstract': u'The belief propagation (BP) based algorithm is investigated as a potential decoder for both of error correcting codes and lossy compression, which are based on non-monotonic tree-like multilayer perceptron encoders. We discuss that whether the BP can give practical algorithms or not in these schemes. The BP implementations in those kind of fully connected networks unfortunately shows strong limitation, while the theoretical results seems a bit promising. Instead, it reveals it might have a rich and complex structure of the solution space via the BP-based algorithms.',

	{'abstract': u'Wireless sensor networks are often modeled in terms of a dense deployment of smart sensor nodes in a two-dimensional region. Give a node deployment, the emph over these locations (i.e., the connected emph with the smallest radius) is a useful structure since it provides the most accurate proportionality between hop-count and Euclidean distance. Hence, it can be used for GPS-free node localisation as well as minimum distance packet forwarding. It is also known to be asymptotically optimal for network transport capacity and power efficiency. In this context, we propose DISCRIT, a distributed and asynchronous algorithm for obtaining an approximation of the CGG on the node locations. The algorithm does not require the knowledge of node locations or internode distances, nor does it require pair-wise RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indication) measurements to be made. Instead, the algorithm makes use of successful Hello receipt counts (obtained during a Hello-protocol-based neighbour discovery process) as edge weights, along with a simple distributed min-max computation algorithm. In this paper, we first provide the theory for justifying the use of the above edge weights. Then we provide extensive simulation results to demonstrate the efficacy of DISCRIT in obtaining an approximation of the CGG. Finally, we show how the CGG obtained from DISCRIT performs when used in certain network self-organisation algorithms.',

	{'abstract': u'This paper considers the joint-decoding (JD) problem for finite-state channels (FSCs) and low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes. In the first part, the linear-programming (LP) decoder for binary linear codes is extended to JD of binary-input FSCs. In particular, we provide a rigorous definition of LP joint-decoding pseudo-codewords (JD-PCWs) that enables evaluation of the pairwise error probability between codewords and JD-PCWs in AWGN. This leads naturally to a provable upper bound on decoder failure probability. If the channel is a finite-state intersymbol interference channel, then the joint LP decoder also has the maximum-likelihood (ML) certificate property and all integer-valued solutions are codewords. In this case, the performance loss relative to ML decoding can be explained completely by fractional-valued JD-PCWs. After deriving these results, we discovered some elements were equivalent to earlier work by Flanagan on LP receivers. In the second part, we develop an efficient iterative solver for the joint LP decoder discussed in the first part. In particular, we extend the approach of iterative approximate LP decoding, proposed by Vontobel and Koetter and analyzed by Burshtein, to this problem. By taking advantage of the dual-domain structure of the JD-LP, we obtain a convergent iterative algorithm for joint LP decoding whose structure is similar to BCJR-based turbo equalization (TE). The result is a joint iterative decoder whose per-iteration complexity is similar to that of TE but whose performance is similar to that of joint LP decoding. The main advantage of this decoder is that it appears to provide the predictability of joint LP decoding and superior performance with the computational complexity of TE. One expected application is coding for magnetic storage where the required block-error rate is extremely low and system performance is difficult to verify by simulation.',
