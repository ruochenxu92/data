	{'abstract': u"This paper studies the problem of testing if an input (Gamma,*), where Gamma is a finite set of unknown size and * is a binary operation over Gamma given as an oracle, is close to a specified class of groups. Friedl et al. [Efficient testing of groups, STOC'05] have constructed an efficient tester using poly(log|Gamma|) queries for the class of abelian groups. We focus in this paper on subclasses of abelian groups, and show that these problems are much harder: Omega(|Gamma|^) queries are necessary to test if the input is close to a cyclic group, and Omega(|Gamma|^c) queries for some constant c are necessary to test more generally if the input is close to an abelian group generated by k elements, for any fixed integer k&gt;0. We also show that knowledge of the size of the ground set Gamma helps only for k=1, in which case we construct an efficient tester using poly(log|Gamma|) queries; for any other value k&gt;1 the query complexity remains Omega(|Gamma|^c). All our upper and lower bounds hold for both the edit distance and the Hamming distance. These are, to the best of our knowledge, the first nontrivial lower bounds for such group-theoretic problems in the property testing model and, in particular, they imply the first exponential separations between the classical and quantum query complexities of testing closeness to classes of groups.",

	{'abstract': u'Recent Microsoft security bulletins show that kernel vulnerabilities are becoming more and more important security threats. Despite the pretty extensive security mitigations many of the kernel vulnerabilities are still exploitable. Successful kernel exploitation typically grants the attacker maximum privilege level and results in total machine compromise. To protect against kernel exploitation, we have developed a tool which statically rewrites the Microsoft Windows kernel as well as other kernel level modules. Such rewritten binary files allow us to monitor control flow transfers during operating system execution. At this point we are able to detect whether selected control transfer flow is valid or should be considered as an attack attempt. Our solution is especially directed towards preventing remote kernel exploitation attempts. Additionally, many of the local privilege escalation attacks are also blocked (also due to additional mitigation techniques we have implemented). Our tool was tested with Microsoft Windows XP, Windows Vista and Windows 7 (under both virtual and physical machines) on IA-32 compatible processors. Our apparatus is also completely standalone and does not require any third party software.',

	{'abstract': u'Unions of graph Fourier multipliers are an important class of linear operators for processing signals defined on graphs. We present a novel method to efficiently distribute the application of these operators to the high-dimensional signals collected by sensor networks. The proposed method features approximations of the graph Fourier multipliers by shifted Chebyshev polynomials, whose recurrence relations make them readily amenable to distributed computation. We demonstrate how the proposed method can be used in a distributed denoising task, and show that the communication requirements of the method scale gracefully with the size of the network.',

For some classes of codes the bound on the minimum distance is refined. Furthermore, a quadratic-time decoding algorithm up to this new bound is developed. The determination of the error locations is based on the Euclidean Algorithm and a modified Chien search. The error evaluation is done by solving a generalization of Forney's formula.",

Fourteen variants of DE were implemented and tested on fourteen benchmark problems for dimensions of 30. The competitiveness of the variants are identified by the Mean Objective Function value, they achieved in 100 runs. The convergence nature of the best and worst performing variants are analyzed by measuring their Convergence Speed (Cs) and Quality Measure (Qm).',

	{'abstract': u'The World Wide Web no longer consists just of HTML pages. Our work sheds light on a number of trends on the Internet that go beyond simple Web pages. The hidden Web provides a wealth of data in semi-structured form, accessible through Web forms and Web services. These services, as well as numerous other applications on the Web, commonly use XML, the eXtensible Markup Language. XML has become the lingua franca of the Internet that allows customized markups to be defined for specific domains. On top of XML, the Semantic Web grows as a common structured data source. In this work, we first explain each of these developments in detail. Using real-world examples from scientific domains of great interest today, we then demonstrate how these new developments can assist the managing, harvesting, and organization of data on the Web. On the way, we also illustrate the current research avenues in these domains. We believe that this effort would help bridge multiple database tracks, thereby attracting researchers with a view to extend database technology.',

These new research avenues become evident, for example, in the topics that doctoral students choose for their dissertations. This paper surveys the emerging multidisciplinary research by doctoral students in database systems and related areas. It is based on the PIKM 2010, which is the 3rd Ph.D. workshop at the International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management (CIKM). The topics addressed include ontology development, data streams, natural language processing, medical databases, green energy, cloud computing, and exploratory search. In addition to core ideas from the workshop, we list some open research questions in these multidisciplinary areas.',

	{'abstract': u'In recent years, the data mining techniques have met a serious challenge due to the increased concerning and worries of the privacy, that is, protecting the privacy of the critical and sensitive data. Different techniques and algorithms have been already presented for Privacy Preserving data mining, which could be classified in three common approaches: Data modification approach, Data sanitization approach and Secure Multi-party Computation approach. This paper presents a Data modification- based Framework for classification and evaluation of the privacy preserving data mining techniques. Based on our framework the techniques are divided into two major groups, namely perturbation approach and anonymization approach. Also in proposed framework, eight functional criteria will be used to analyze and analogically assessment of the techniques in these two major groups. The proposed framework provides a good basis for more accurate comparison of the given techniques to privacy preserving data mining. In addition, this framework allows recognizing the overlapping amount for different approaches and identifying modern approaches in this field.',

	{'abstract': u'Statistical dependencies among wavelet coefficients are commonly represented by graphical models such as hidden Markov trees(HMTs). However, in linear inverse problems such as deconvolution, tomography, and compressed sensing, the presence of a sensing or observation matrix produces a linear mixing of the simple Markovian dependency structure. This leads to reconstruction problems that are non-convex optimizations. Past work has dealt with this issue by resorting to greedy or suboptimal iterative reconstruction methods. In this paper, we propose new modeling approaches based on group-sparsity penalties that leads to convex optimizations that can be solved exactly and efficiently. We show that the methods we develop perform significantly better in deconvolution and compressed sensing applications, while being as computationally efficient as standard coefficient-wise approaches such as lasso.',

	{'abstract': u"We study the asymptotic performance of two multi-hop overlaid ad-hoc networks that utilize the same temporal, spectral, and spatial resources based on random access schemes. The primary network consists of Poisson distributed legacy users with density lambda^ and the secondary network consists of Poisson distributed cognitive radio users with density lambda^ = ( lambda^)^ ( beta&gt;0, beta neq 1) that utilize the spectrum opportunistically. Both networks are decentralized and employ ALOHA medium access protocols where the secondary nodes are additionally equipped with range-limited perfect spectrum sensors to monitor and protect primary transmissions. We study the problem in two distinct regimes, namely beta&gt;1 and 0&lt; beta&lt;1. We show that in both cases, the two networks can achieve their corresponding stand-alone throughput scaling even without secondary spectrum sensing (i.e., the sensing range set to zero); this implies the need for a more comprehensive performance metric than just throughput scaling to evaluate the influence of the overlaid interactions. We thus introduce a new criterion, termed the asymptotic multiplexing gain, which captures the effect of inter-network interferences with different spectrum sensing setups. With this metric, we clearly demonstrate that spectrum sensing can substantially improve primary network performance when beta&gt;1. On the contrary, spectrum sensing turns out to be unnecessary when beta&lt;1 and setting the secondary network's ALOHA parameter appropriately can substantially improve primary network performance.",

	{'abstract': u"As the Distributed Collection Manager's work on building tools to support users maintaining collections of changing web-based resources has progressed, questions about the characteristics of people's collections of web pages have arisen. Simultaneously, work in the areas of social bookmarking, social news, and subscription-based technologies have been taking the existence, usage, and utility of this data for granted with neither investigation into what people are doing with their collections nor how they are trying to maintain them. In order to address these concerns, we performed an online user study of 125 individuals from a variety of online and offline communities, such as the reddit social news user community and the graduate student body in our department. From this study we were able to examine a user's needs for a system to manage their web-based distributed collections, how their current tools affect their ability to maintain their collections, and what the characteristics of their current practices and problems in maintaining their web-based collections were. We also present extensions and improvements being made to the system both in order to adapt DCM for usage in the Ensemble project and to meet the requirements found by our user study.",

	{'abstract': u'This paper proposes a form of MPC in which the control variables are moved asynchronously. This contrasts with most MIMO control schemes, which assume that all variables are updated simultaneously. MPC outperforms other control strategies through its ability to deal with constraints. This requires on-line optimization, hence computational complexity can become an issue when applying MPC to complex systems with fast response times. The multiplexed MPC scheme described in this paper solves the MPC problem for each subsystem sequentially, and updates subsystem controls as soon as the solution is available, thus distributing the control moves over a complete update cycle. The resulting computational speed-up allows faster response to disturbances, which may result in improved performance, despite finding sub-optimal solutions to the original problem.',

	{'abstract': u"Spectrum sensing receives much attention recently in the cognitive radio (CR) network research, i.e., secondary users (SUs) constantly monitor channel condition to detect the presence of the primary users (PUs). In this paper, we go beyond spectrum sensing and introduce the PU separation problem, which concerns with the issues of distinguishing and characterizing PUs in the context of collaborative spectrum sensing and monitor selection. The observations of monitors are modeled as boolean OR mixtures of underlying binary sources for PUs. We first justify the use of the binary OR mixture model as opposed to the traditional linear mixture model through simulation studies. Then we devise a novel binary inference algorithm for PU separation. Not only PU-SU relationship are revealed, but PUs' transmission statistics and activities at each time slot can also be inferred. Simulation results show that without any prior knowledge regarding PUs' activities, the algorithm achieves high inference accuracy even in the presence of noisy measurements.",

	{'abstract': u"Initial Semantics aims at characterizing the syntax associated to a signature as the initial object of some category. We present an initial semantics result for typed higher-order syntax together with its formalization in the Coq proof assistant. The main theorem was first proved on paper in the second author's PhD thesis in 2010, and verified formally shortly afterwards. To a simply-typed binding signature S over a fixed set T of object types we associate a category called the category of representations of S. We show that this category has an initial object Sigma(S). From its construction it will be clear that the object Sigma(S) merits the name abstract syntax associated to S. Our theorem is implemented and proved correct in the proof assistant Coq through heavy use of dependent types. The approach through monads gives rise to an implementation of syntax where both terms and variables are intrinsically typed, i.e. where the object types are reflected in the meta-level types. This article is to be seen as a research article rather than about the formalization of a classical mathematical result. The nature of our theorem - involving lengthy, technical proofs and complicated algebraic structures - makes it particularly interesting for formal verification. Our goal is to promote the use of computer theorem provers as research tools, and, accordingly, a new way of publishing mathematical results: a parallel description of a theorem and its formalization should allow the verification of correct transcription of definitions and statements into the proof assistant, and straightforward but technical proofs should be well-hidden in a digital library. We argue that Coq's rich type theory, combined with its various features such as implicit arguments, allows a particularly readable formalization and is hence well-suited for communicating mathematics.",

	{'abstract': u"This paper studies the problem of neighbor discovery in wireless networks, namely, each node wishes to discover and identify the network interface addresses (NIAs) of those nodes within a single hop. A novel paradigm, called compressed neighbor discovery is proposed, which enables all nodes to simultaneously discover their respective neighborhoods with a single frame of transmission, which is typically of a few thousand symbol epochs. The key technique is to assign each node a unique on-off signature and let all nodes simultaneously transmit their signatures. Despite that the radios are half-duplex, each node observes a superposition of its neighbors' signatures (partially) through its own off-slots. To identify its neighbors out of a large network address space, each node solves a compressed sensing (or sparse recovery) problem. Two practical schemes are studied. The first employs random on-off signatures, and each node discovers its neighbors using a noncoherent detection algorithm based on group testing. The second scheme uses on-off signatures based on a deterministic second-order Reed-Muller code, and applies a chirp decoding algorithm. The second scheme needs much lower signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) to achieve the same error performance. The complexity of the chirp decoding algorithm is sub-linear, so that it is in principle scalable to networks with billions of nodes with 48-bit IEEE 802.11 MAC addresses. The compressed neighbor discovery schemes are much more efficient than conventional random-access discovery, where nodes have to retransmit over many frames with random delays to be successfully discovered.",

	{'abstract': u'In this paper, we demonstrate some applications of compressive sensing over networks. We make a connection between compressive sensing and traditional information theoretic techniques in source coding and channel coding. Our results provide an explicit trade-off between the rate and the decoding complexity. The key difference of compressive sensing and traditional information theoretic approaches is at their decoding side. Although optimal decoders to recover the original signal, compressed by source coding have high complexity, the compressive sensing decoder is a linear or convex optimization. First, we investigate applications of compressive sensing on distributed compression of correlated sources. Here, by using compressive sensing, we propose a compression scheme for a family of correlated sources with a modularized decoder, providing a trade-off between the compression rate and the decoding complexity. We call this scheme Sparse Distributed Compression. We use this compression scheme for a general multicast network with correlated sources. Here, we first decode some of the sources by a network decoding technique and then, we use a compressive sensing decoder to obtain the whole sources. Then, we investigate applications of compressive sensing on channel coding. We propose a coding scheme that combines compressive sensing and random channel coding for a high-SNR point-to-point Gaussian channel. We call this scheme Sparse Channel Coding. We propose a modularized decoder providing a trade-off between the capacity loss and the decoding complexity. At the receiver side, first, we use a compressive sensing decoder on a noisy signal to obtain a noisy estimate of the original signal and then, we apply a traditional channel coding decoder to find the original signal.',

	{'abstract': u'In practical applications, machine learning algorithms are often needed to learn classifiers that optimize domain specific performance measures. Previously, the research has focused on learning the needed classifier in isolation, yet learning nonlinear classifier for nonlinear and nonsmooth performance measures is still hard. In this paper, rather than learning the needed classifier by optimizing specific performance measure directly, we circumvent this problem by proposing a novel two-step approach called as CAPO, namely to first train nonlinear auxiliary classifiers with existing learning methods, and then to adapt auxiliary classifiers for specific performance measures. In the first step, auxiliary classifiers can be obtained efficiently by taking off-the-shelf learning algorithms. For the second step, we show that the classifier adaptation problem can be reduced to a quadratic program problem, which is similar to linear SVMperf and can be efficiently solved. By exploiting nonlinear auxiliary classifiers, CAPO can generate nonlinear classifier which optimizes a large variety of performance measures including all the performance measure based on the contingency table and AUC, whilst keeping high computational efficiency. Empirical studies show that CAPO is effective and of high computational efficiency, and even it is more efficient than linear SVMperf.',

	{'abstract': u'Wide implementation of IEEE 802.11 based networks could lead to deployment of localized wireless data communication environments with a limited number of mobile hosts, called ad hoc networks. Implementation of a proper routing methodology in ad hoc networks makes it efficient in terms of performance. A wide spectrum of routing protocols has been contributed by several researchers. Real time applications have been most popular among the applications, run by ad hoc networks. Such applications strictly adhere to the Quality of Service (QoS) requirements such as overall throughput, end-toend delay and power level. Support of QoS requirements becomes more challenging due to dynamic nature of MANETs, where mobility of nodes results in frequent change in topology. QoS aware routing protocols can serve to the QoS support, which concentrate on determining a path between source and destination with the QoS requirements of the flow being satisfied. We propose a protocol, called Power and Delay aware Temporally Ordered Routing Algorithm (PDTORA), based on Temporally Ordered Routing Algorithm (TORA) Protocol, where verification of power and delay requirements is carried out with a query packet at each node along the path between source and destination. Simulations justify better performance of the proposed new protocol in terms of network lifetime, end-to-end delay and packet delivery ratio as compared to TORA.',

	{'abstract': u"The use of domain knowledge is generally found to improve query efficiency in content filtering applications. In particular, tangible benefits have been achieved when using knowledge-based approaches within more specialized fields, such as medical free texts or legal documents. However, the problem is that sources of domain knowledge are time-consuming to build and equally costly to maintain. As a potential remedy, recent studies on Wikipedia suggest that this large body of socially constructed knowledge can be effectively harnessed to provide not only facts but also accurate information about semantic concept-similarities. This paper describes a framework for document filtering, where Wikipedia's concept-relatedness information is combined with a domain ontology to produce semantic content classifiers. The approach is evaluated using Reuters RCV1 corpus and TREC-11 filtering task definitions. In a comparative study, the approach shows robust performance and appears to outperform content classifiers based on Support Vector Machines (SVM) and C4.5 algorithm.",

	{'abstract': u'Most of the existing information retrieval systems are based on bag of words model and are not equipped with common world knowledge. Work has been done towards improving the efficiency of such systems by using intelligent algorithms to generate search queries, however, not much research has been done in the direction of incorporating human-and-society level knowledge in the queries. This paper is one of the first attempts where such information is incorporated into the search queries using Wikipedia semantics. The paper presents an essential shift from conventional token based queries to concept based queries, leading to an enhanced efficiency of information retrieval systems. To efficiently handle the automated query learning problem, we propose Wikipedia-based Evolutionary Semantics (Wiki-ES) framework where concept based queries are learnt using a co-evolving evolutionary procedure. Learning concept based queries using an intelligent evolutionary procedure yields significant improvement in performance which is shown through an extensive study using Reuters newswire documents. Comparison of the proposed framework is performed with other information retrieval systems. Concept based approach has also been implemented on other information retrieval systems to justify the effectiveness of a transition from token based queries to concept based queries.',

	{'abstract': u'This paper studies a generalization of multi-prover interactive proofs in which a verifier interacts with two competing teams of provers: one team attempts to convince the verifier to accept while the other attempts to convince the verifier to reject. Each team consists of two provers who jointly implement a no-signaling strategy. No-signaling strategies are a curious class of joint strategy that cannot in general be implemented without communication between the provers, yet cannot be used as a black box to establish communication between them. Attention is restricted in this paper to two-turn interactions in which the verifier asks questions of each of the four provers and decides whether to accept or reject based on their responses. We prove that the complexity class of decision problems that admit two-turn interactive proofs with competing teams of no-signaling provers is a subset of PSPACE. This upper bound matches existing PSPACE lower bounds on the following two disparate and weaker classes of interactive proof: 1. Two-turn multi-prover interactive proofs with only one team of no-signaling provers. 2. Two-turn competing-prover interactive proofs with only one prover per team. Our result implies that the complexity of these two models is unchanged by the addition of a second competing team of no-signaling provers in the first case and by the addition of a second no-signaling prover to each team in the second case. Moreover, our result unifies and subsumes prior PSPACE upper bounds on these classes.',

	{'abstract': u'Many problems in machine learning and statistics can be formulated as (generalized) eigenproblems. In terms of the associated optimization problem, computing linear eigenvectors amounts to finding critical points of a quadratic function subject to quadratic constraints. In this paper we show that a certain class of constrained optimization problems with nonquadratic objective and constraints can be understood as nonlinear eigenproblems. We derive a generalization of the inverse power method which is guaranteed to converge to a nonlinear eigenvector. We apply the inverse power method to 1-spectral clustering and sparse PCA which can naturally be formulated as nonlinear eigenproblems. In both applications we achieve state-of-the-art results in terms of solution quality and runtime. Moving beyond the standard eigenproblem should be useful also in many other applications and our inverse power method can be easily adapted to new problems.',

We show that its output is sometimes incomplete, due to an oversight in its mathematical validation. We propose alternative complete generators and we extend the approach to an existing closure-aware basis similar to, and often smaller than, the representative rules, namely the basis B*.',

	{'abstract': u"We prove the following strong hardness result for learning: Given a distribution of labeled examples from the hypercube such that there exists a monomial consistent with of the examples, it is NP-hard to find a halfspace that is correct on of the examples, for arbitrary constants . In learning theory terms, weak agnostic learning of monomials is hard, even if one is allowed to output a hypothesis from the much bigger concept class of halfspaces. This hardness result subsumes a long line of previous results, including two recent hardness results for the proper learning of monomials and halfspaces. As an immediate corollary of our result we show that weak agnostic learning of decision lists is NP-hard. Our techniques are quite different from previous hardness proofs for learning. We define distributions on positive and negative examples for monomials whose first few moments match. We use the invariance principle to argue that regular halfspaces (all of whose coefficients have small absolute value relative to the total norm) cannot distinguish between distributions whose first few moments match. For highly non-regular subspaces, we use a structural lemma from recent work on fooling halfspaces to argue that they are ``junta-like'' and one can zero out all but the top few coefficients without affecting the performance of the halfspace. The top few coefficients form the natural list decoding of a halfspace in the context of dictatorship tests/Label Cover reductions. We note that unlike previous invariance principle based proofs which are only known to give Unique-Games hardness, we are able to reduce from a version of Label Cover problem that is known to be NP-hard. This has inspired follow-up work on bypassing the Unique Games conjecture in some optimal geometric inapproximability results.",

	{'abstract': u'Malicious mobile phone worms spread between devices via short-range Bluetooth contacts, similar to the propagation of human and other biological viruses. Recent work has employed models from epidemiology and complex networks to analyse the spread of malware and the effect of patching specific nodes. These approaches have adopted a static view of the mobile networks, i.e., by aggregating all the edges that appear over time, which leads to an approximate representation of the real interactions: instead, these networks are inherently dynamic and the edge appearance and disappearance is highly influenced by the ordering of the human contacts, something which is not captured at all by existing complex network measures. In this paper we first study how the blocking of malware propagation through immunisation of key nodes (even if carefully chosen through static or temporal betweenness centrality metrics) is ineffective: this is due to the richness of alternative paths in these networks. Then we introduce a time-aware containment strategy that spreads a patch message starting from nodes with high temporal closeness centrality and show its effectiveness using three real-world datasets. Temporal closeness allows the identification of nodes able to reach most nodes quickly: we show that this scheme can reduce the cellular network resource consumption and associated costs, achieving, at the same time, a complete containment of the malware in a limited amount of time.',

	{'abstract': u'Web query log data contain information useful to research; however, release of such data can re-identify the search engine users issuing the queries. These privacy concerns go far beyond removing explicitly identifying information such as name and address, since non-identifying personal data can be combined with publicly available information to pinpoint to an individual. In this work we model web query logs as unstructured transaction data and present a novel transaction anonymization technique based on clustering and generalization techniques to achieve the k-anonymity privacy. We conduct extensive experiments on the AOL query log data. Our results show that this method results in a higher data utility compared to the state of-the-art transaction anonymization methods.',

	{'abstract': u'This paper considers the problem of finding a quickest path between two points in the Euclidean plane in the presence of a transportation network. A transportation network consists of a planar network where each road (edge) has an individual speed. A traveller may enter and exit the network at any point on the roads. Along any road the traveller moves with a fixed speed depending on the road, and outside the network the traveller moves at unit speed in any direction. We give an exact algorithm for the basic version of the problem: given a transportation network of total complexity n in the Euclidean plane, a source point s and a destination point t, and the quickest path between s and t. We also show how the transportation network can be preprocessed in time O(n^2 log n) into a data structure of size O(n^2) such that (1 + epsilon)-approximate cheapest path cost queries between any two points in the plane can be answered in time O(1 epsilon^4 log n).',

	{'abstract': u'Corporate mail services are designed to perform better than public mail services. Fast mail delivery, large size file transfer as an attachments, high level spam and virus protection, commercial advertisement free environment are some of the advantages worth to mention. But these mail services are frequent target of hackers and spammers. Distributed Denial of service attacks are becoming more common and sophisticated. The researchers have proposed various solutions to the DDOS attacks. Can we stop these kinds of attacks with available technology? These days the DDoS attack through spam has increased and disturbed the mail services of various organizations. Spam penetrates through all the filters to establish DDoS attacks, which causes serious problems to users and the data. In this paper we propose a novel approach to defend DDoS attack caused by spam mails. This approach is a combination of fine tuning of source filters, content filters, strictly implementing mail policies,educating user, network monitoring and logical solutions to the ongoing attack. We have conducted several experiments in corporate mail services; the results show that this approach is highly effective to prevent DDoS attack caused by spam. The novel defense mechanism reduced 60% of the incoming spam traffic and repelled many DDoS attacks caused by spam.',

	{'abstract': u'We present a mathematical connection between channel coding and compressed sensing. In particular, we link, on the one hand, emph, which is a well-known relaxation o maximum-likelihood channel decoding for binary linear codes, and, on the other hand, emph, also known as basis pursuit, which is a widely used linear programming relaxation for the problem of finding the sparsest solution of an under-determined system of linear equations. More specifically, we establis a tight connection between CS-LPD based on a zero-one measurement matrix over the reals and CC-LPD of the binary linear channel code that is obtained by viewing this measurement matrix as a binary parity-check matrix. This connection allows the translation of performance guarantees from one setup to the other. The main message of this paper is that parity-check matrices of "good" channel codes can be used as provably "good" measurement matrices under basis pursuit. In particular, we provide the first deterministic construction of compressed sensing measurement matrices with an order-optimal number of rows using high-girth low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes constructed by Gallager.',

The case of a single relay has been extensively studied in the literature and several techniques to approach the optimum performance have been proposed. Until recently, however, a practical implementation for the case of several relays had been considered to be much more challenging. A rotation-based DDF technique, suitable for any number of relays, has been recently proposed which promises to overcome important implementation hurdles. This article provides an overview of the DDF protocol, describes different implementation techniques and compares their performance.',

Such edges are related to the notion of convex decompositions spanned by S. We prove a worst-case tight lower bound for the number of pseudo-simultaneously flippable edges in a triangulation in terms of the number of vertices. We use this bound for deriving new upper bounds for the maximal number of crossing-free straight-edge graphs that can be embedded on any fixed set of N points in the plane. We obtain new upper bounds for the number of spanning trees and forests as well. Specifically, let tr(N) denote the maximum number of triangulations on a set of N points in the plane. Then we show (using the known bound tr(N) &lt; 30^N) that any N-element point set admits at most 6.9283^N * tr(N) &lt; 207.85^N crossing-free straight-edge graphs, O(4.7022^N) * tr(N) = O(141.07^N) spanning trees, and O(5.3514^N) * tr(N) = O(160.55^N) forests.

LLL can be also used to prove the consistency of an infinite set of conditions, using standard compactness argument (if an infinite set of conditions is inconsistent, then some finite part of it is inconsistent, too, which contradicts LLL). In this way we show that objects satisfying all the conditions do exist (though the probability of this event equals~). However, if we are interested in finding a computable solution that satisfies all the constraints, compactness arguments do not work anymore. Moser and Tardos recently gave a nice constructive proof of LLL. Lance Fortnow asked whether one can apply Moser--Tardos technique to prove the existence of a computable solution.

	{'abstract': u'Motivated by an open problem from graph drawing, we study several partitioning problems for line and hyperplane arrangements. We prove a ham-sandwich cut theorem: given two sets of n lines in R^2, there is a line l such that in both line sets, for both halfplanes delimited by l, there are n^ lines which pairwise intersect in that halfplane, and this bound is tight; a centerpoint theorem: for any set of n lines there is a point such that for any halfplane containing that point there are (n/3)^ of the lines which pairwise intersect in that halfplane. We generalize those results in higher dimension and obtain a center transversal theorem, a same-type lemma, and a positive portion Erdos-Szekeres theorem for hyperplane arrangements. This is done by formulating a generalization of the center transversal theorem which applies to set functions that are much more general than measures. Back to Graph Drawing (and in the plane), we completely solve the open problem that motivated our search: there is no set of n labelled lines that are universal for all n-vertex labelled planar graphs. As a side note, we prove that every set of n (unlabelled) lines is universal for all n-vertex (unlabelled) planar graphs.',

	{'abstract': u'We present an architecture of a hosting system consisting of a set of hosted Web Services subject to QoS constraints, and a certain number of servers used to run users demand. The traffic is session-based, while provider and users agree on SLAs specifying the expected level of service performance such that the service provider is liable to compensate his/her customers if the level of performance is not satisfactory. The system is driven by a utility function which tries to optimize the average earned revenue per unit time. The middleware collects demand and performance statistics, and estimates traffic parameters in order to make dynamic decisions concerning server allocation and admission control. We empirically evaluate the effects of admission policies, resource allocation and service differentiation schemes on the achieved revenues, and we find that our system is robust enough to successfully deal with session-based traffic under different conditions.',

	{'abstract': u"Recommendation systems are emerging as an important business application with significant economic impact. Currently popular systems include Amazon's book recommendations, Netflix's movie recommendations, and Pandora's music recommendations. In this paper we address the problem of estimating probabilities associated with recommendation system data using non-parametric kernel smoothing. In our estimation we interpret missing items as randomly censored observations and obtain efficient computation schemes using combinatorial properties of generating functions. We demonstrate our approach with several case studies involving real world movie recommendation data. The results are comparable with state-of-the-art techniques while also providing probabilistic preference estimates outside the scope of traditional recommender systems.",

	{'abstract': u"In multi-user communication from one base station (BS) to multiple users, the problem of minimizing the transmit power to achieve some target guaranteed performance (rates) at users has been well investigated in the literature. Similarly various user selection algorithms have been proposed and analyzed when the BS has to transmit to a subset of the users in the system, mostly for the objective of the sum rate maximization. We study the joint problem of minimizing the transmit power at the BS to achieve specific signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio (SINR) targets at users in conjunction with user scheduling. The general analytical results for the average transmit power required to meet guaranteed performance at the users' side are difficult to obtain even without user selection due to joint optimization required over beamforming vectors and power allocation scalars. We study the transmit power minimization problem with various user selection algorithms, namely semi-orthogonal user selection (SUS), norm-based user selection (NUS) and angle-based user selection (AUS). When the SINR targets to achieve are relatively large, the average minimum transmit power expressions are derived for NUS and SUS for any number of users. For the special case when only two users are selected, similar expressions are further derived for AUS and a performance upper bound which serves to benchmark the performance of other selection schemes. Simulation results performed under various settings indicate that SUS is by far the better user selection criterion.",

	{'abstract': u'In this paper, a compress-and-forward scheme with backward decoding is presented for the unicast wireless relay network. The encoding at the source and relay is a generalization of the noisy network coding scheme (NNC). While it achieves the same reliable data rate as noisy network coding scheme, the backward decoding allows for a better decoding complexity as compared to the joint decoding of the NNC scheme. Characterizing the layered decoding scheme is shown to be equivalent to characterizing an information flow for the wireless network. A node-flow for a graph with bisubmodular capacity constraints is presented and a max-flow min-cut theorem is proved for it. This generalizes many well-known results of flows over capacity constrained graphs studied in computer science literature. The results for the unicast relay network are generalized to the network with multiple sources with independent messages intended for a single destination.',

Not much work has been done to identify discrete distributions for which the inequality holds with the differential entropy replaced by the discrete entropy. Harremo "s and Vignat showed that it holds for the pair (B(m,p), B(n,p)), m,n in mathbb, (where B(n,p) is a Binomial distribution with n trials each with success probability p) for p = 0.5. In this paper, we considerably expand the set of Binomial distributions for which the inequality holds and, in particular, identify n_0(p) such that for all m,n geq n_0(p), the EPI holds for (B(m,p), B(n,p)). We further show that the EPI holds for the discrete random variables that can be expressed as the sum of n independent identical distributed (IID) discrete random variables for large n.',

	{'abstract': u'This paper investigates universal polar coding schemes. In particular, a notion of ordering (called convolutional path) is introduced between probability distributions to determine when a polar compression (or communication) scheme designed for one distribution can also succeed for another one. The original polar decoding algorithm is also generalized to an algorithm allowing to learn information about the source distribution using the idea of checkers. These tools are used to construct a universal compression algorithm for binary sources, operating at the lowest achievable rate (entropy), with low complexity and with guaranteed small error probability. In a second part of the paper, the problem of sketching high dimensional discrete signals which are sparse is approached via the polarization technique. It is shown that the number of measurements required for perfect recovery is competitive with the bound (with optimal constant for binary signals), meanwhile affording a deterministic low complexity measurement matrix.',

	{'abstract': u'Recent years have witnessed the popularity of using rank minimization as a regularizer for various signal processing and machine learning problems. As rank minimization problems are often converted to nuclear norm minimization (NNM) problems, they have to be solved iteratively and each iteration requires computing a singular value decomposition (SVD). Therefore, their solution suffers from the high computation cost of multiple SVDs. To relieve this issue, we propose using the block Lanczos method to compute the partial SVDs, where the principal singular subspaces obtained in the previous iteration are used to start the block Lanczos procedure. To avoid the expensive reorthogonalization in the Lanczos procedure, the block Lanczos procedure is performed for only a few steps. Our block Lanczos with warm start (BLWS) technique can be adopted by different algorithms that solve NNM problems. We present numerical results on applying BLWS to Robust PCA and Matrix Completion problems. Experimental results show that our BLWS technique usually accelerates its host algorithm by at least two to three times.',

	{'abstract': u'In the case of the scientometric evaluation of multi- or interdisciplinary units one risks to compare apples with oranges: each paper has to assessed in comparison to an appropriate reference set. We suggest that the set of citing papers first can be considered as the relevant representation of the field of impact. In order to normalize for differences in citation behavior among fields, citations can be fractionally counted proportionately to the length of the reference lists in the citing papers. This new method enables us to compare among units with different disciplinary affiliations at the paper level and also to assess the statistical significance of differences among sets. Twenty-seven departments of the Tsinghua University in Beijing are thus compared. Among them, the Department of Chinese Language and Linguistics is upgraded from the 19th to the second position in the ranking. The overall impact of 19 of the 27 departments is not significantly different at the 5% level when thus normalized for different citation potentials.',

	{'abstract': u'A boolean expression is in read-once form if each of its variables appears exactly once. When the variables denote independent events in a probability space, the probability of the event denoted by the whole expression in read-once form can be computed in polynomial time (whereas the general problem for arbitrary expressions is #P-complete). Known approaches to checking read-once property seem to require putting these expressions in disjunctive normal form. In this paper, we tell a better story for a large subclass of boolean event expressions: those that are generated by conjunctive queries without self-joins and on tuple-independent probabilistic databases. We first show that given a tuple-independent representation and the provenance graph of an SPJ query plan without self-joins, we can, without using the DNF of a result event expression, efficiently compute its co-occurrence graph. From this, the read-once form can already, if it exists, be computed efficiently using existing techniques. Our second and key contribution is a complete, efficient, and simple to implement algorithm for computing the read-once forms (whenever they exist) directly, using a new concept, that of co-table graph, which can be significantly smaller than the co-occurrence graph.',

	{'abstract': u'This paper is an attempt to incorporate the idea of spiking neural P systems as an early seed into the area of Operating System Design, regarding their capability to solve some classical computer science problems. It is reflecting the power of such systems to simulate well known parallel computational models, like logic gates, arithmetic operation, and sorting. In these devices, the time (when the neurons fire and/or spike) plays an essential role. For instance, the result of a computation is the time between the moments when a specified neuron spikes. Seen as number computing devices, SN P systems are shown to be computationally complete, and with such capabilities, arithmetic operations, logic, and timing, some first steps could be taken towards an OS design.',

	{'abstract': u'Uncertainty of decisions in safety-critical engineering applications can be estimated on the basis of the Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) technique of averaging over decision models. The use of decision tree (DT) models assists experts to interpret causal relations and find factors of the uncertainty. Bayesian averaging also allows experts to estimate the uncertainty accurately when a priori information on the favored structure of DTs is available. Then an expert can select a single DT model, typically the Maximum a Posteriori model, for interpretation purposes. Unfortunately, a priori information on favored structure of DTs is not always available. For this reason, we suggest a new prior on DTs for the Bayesian MCMC technique. We also suggest a new procedure of selecting a single DT and describe an application scenario. In our experiments on the Short-Term Conflict Alert data our technique outperforms the existing Bayesian techniques in predictive accuracy of the selected single DTs.',

	{'abstract': u"We live in a world increasingly dominated by networks -- communications, social, information, biological etc. A central attribute of many of these networks is that they are dynamic, that is, they exhibit structural changes over time. While the practice of dynamic networks has proliferated, we lag behind in the fundamental, mathematical understanding of network dynamism. Existing research on time-varying graphs ranges from preliminary algorithmic studies (e.g., Ferreira's work on evolving graphs) to analysis of specific properties such as flooding time in dynamic random graphs. A popular model for studying dynamic graphs is a sequence of graphs arranged by increasing snapshots of time. In this paper, we study the fundamental property of reachability in a time-varying graph over time and characterize the latency with respect to two metrics, namely store-or-advance latency and cut-through latency. Instead of expected value analysis, we concentrate on characterizing the exact probability distribution of routing latency along a randomly intermittent path in two popular dynamic random graph models. Using this analysis, we characterize the loss of accuracy (in a probabilistic setting) between multiple temporal graph models, ranging from one that preserves all the temporal ordering information for the purpose of computing temporal graph properties to one that collapses various snapshots into one graph (an operation called smashing), with multiple intermediate variants. We also show how some other traditional graph theoretic properties can be extended to the temporal domain. Finally, we propose algorithms for controlling the progress of a packet in single-copy adaptive routing schemes in various dynamic random graphs.",

This is one of the central problems in topological graph theory, that has been studied extensively over the past three decades. The first non-trivial efficient algorithm for the problem, due to Leighton and Rao, achieved an -approximation for bounded degree graphs. This algorithm has since been improved by poly-logarithmic factors, with the best current approximation ratio standing on for graphs with maximum degree . In contrast, only APX-hardness is known on the negative side. In this paper we present an efficient randomized algorithm to find a drawing of any -vertex graph in the plane with crossings, where is the number of crossings in the optimal solution, and is the maximum vertex degree in .

The other area in the Image mining system is the Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) which performs retrieval based on the similarity defined in terms of extracted features with more objectiveness. The drawback in CBIR is the features of the query image alone are considered. Hence, a new technique called Image retrieval based on optimum clusters is proposed for improving user interaction with image retrieval systems by fully exploiting the similarity information. The index is created by describing the images according to their color characteristics, with compact feature vectors, that represent typical color distributions [12].',

	{'abstract': u'Socio-economic data mining has a great potential in terms of gaining a better understanding of problems that our economy and society are facing, such as financial instability, shortages of resources, or conflicts. Without large-scale data mining, progress in these areas seems hard or impossible. Therefore, a suitable, distributed data mining infrastructure and research centers should be built in Europe. It also appears appropriate to build a network of Crisis Observatories. They can be imagined as laboratories devoted to the gathering and processing of enormous volumes of data on both natural systems such as the Earth and its ecosystem, as well as on human techno-socio-economic systems, so as to gain early warnings of impending events. Reality mining provides the chance to adapt more quickly and more accurately to changing situations. Further opportunities arise by individually customized services, which however should be provided in a privacy-respecting way. This requires the development of novel ICT (such as a self- organizing Web), but most likely new legal regulations and suitable institutions as well. As long as such regulations are lacking on a world-wide scale, it is in the public interest that scientists explore what can be done with the huge data available. Big data do have the potential to change or even threaten democratic societies. The same applies to sudden and large-scale failures of ICT systems. Therefore, dealing with data must be done with a large degree of responsibility and care. Self-interests of individuals, companies or institutions have limits, where the public interest is affected, and public interest is not a sufficient justification to violate human rights of individuals. Privacy is a high good, as confidentiality is, and damaging it would have serious side effects for society.',

	{'abstract': u'The GIIDA project aims to develop a digital infrastructure for the spatial information within CNR. It is foreseen to use semantic-oriented technologies to ease information modeling and connecting, according to international standards like the ISO/IEC 11179. Complex information management systems, like GIIDA, will take benefit from the use of terminological tools like thesauri that make available a reference lexicon for the indexing and retrieval of information. Within GIIDA the goal is to make available the EARTh thesaurus (Environmental Applications Reference Thesaurus), developed by the CNR-IIA-EKOLab. A web-based software, developed by the CNR-Water Research Institute (IRSA) was implemented to allow consultation and utilization of thesaurus through the web. This service is a useful tool to ensure interoperability between thesaurus and other systems of the indexing, with, the idea of cooperating to develop a comprehensive system of knowledge organization, that could be defined integrated, open, multi-functional and multilingual. Currently the system is available in multiple languages mode (Italian - English) and navigation can be done in the following ways: Alphabetical, Hierarchical and for Themes. A full search allows to find any term by searching for the whole term or a part of it and as well as allows to filter the results by themes. Within a collaborative initiative with the CNR-Institute of Applied Mathematics and Information Technology (IMATI) a SKOS (Simple Knowledge Organization System) version of EARTh was developed. This will ensure the possibility to support the use of the thesaurus within the framework of the Semantic Web in order to be used in decentralized metadata applications',

	{'abstract': u'In this paper, we propose a new method of channel estimation for asynchronous additive white Gaussian noise channels in satellite communications. This method is based on signals correlation and multiuser interference cancellation which adopts a successive structure. Propagation delays and signals amplitudes are jointly estimated in order to be used for data detection at the receiver. As, a multiuser detector, a single stage successive interference cancellation (SIC) architecture is analyzed and integrated to the channel estimation technique and the whole system is evaluated. The satellite access method adopted is the direct sequence code division multiple access (DS CDMA) one. To evaluate the channel estimation and the detection technique, we have simulated a satellite uplink with an asynchronous multiuser access.',

	{'abstract': u'This work considers the multiple-access multicast error-correction scenario over a packetized network with malicious edge adversaries. The network has min-cut and packets of length , and each sink demands all information from the set of sources . The capacity region is characterized for both a "side-channel" model (where sources and sinks share some random bits that are secret from the adversary) and an "omniscient" adversarial model (where no limitations on the adversary\'s knowledge are assumed). In the "side-channel" adversarial model, the use of a secret channel allows higher rates to be achieved compared to the "omniscient" adversarial model, and a polynomial-complexity capacity-achieving code is provided. For the "omniscient" adversarial model, two capacity-achieving constructions are given: the first is based on random subspace code design and has complexity exponential in , while the second uses a novel multiple-field-extension technique and has complexity, which is polynomial in the network size. Our code constructions are "end-to-end" in that all nodes except the sources and sinks are oblivious to the adversaries and may simply implement predesigned linear network codes (random or otherwise). Also, the sources act independently without knowledge of the data from other sources.',

	{'abstract': u'Gesture recognition is mainly apprehensive on analyzing the functionality of human wits. The main goal of gesture recognition is to create a system which can recognize specific human gestures and use them to convey information or for device control. Hand gestures provide a separate complementary modality to speech for expressing ones ideas. Information associated with hand gestures in a conversation is degree,discourse structure, spatial and temporal structure. The approaches present can be mainly divided into Data-Glove Based and Vision Based approaches. An important face feature point is the nose tip. Since nose is the highest protruding point from the face. Besides that, it is not affected by facial expressions.Another important function of the nose is that it is able to indicate the head pose. Knowledge of the nose location will enable us to align an unknown 3D face with those in a face database. Eye detection is divided into eye position detection and eye contour detection. Existing works in eye detection can be classified into two major categories: traditional image-based passive approaches and the active IR based approaches. The former uses intensity and shape of eyes for detection and the latter works on the assumption that eyes have a reflection under near IR illumination and produce bright/dark pupil effect. The traditional methods can be broadly classified into three categories: template based methods,appearance based methods and feature based methods. The purpose of this paper is to compare various human Gesture recognition systems for interfacing machines directly to human wits without any corporeal media in an ambient environment.',

	{'abstract': u'We consider molecular communication, with information conveyed in the time of release of molecules. The main contribution of this paper is the development of a theoretical foundation for such a communication system. Specifically, we develop the additive inverse Gaussian (IG) noise channel model: a channel in which the information is corrupted by noise with an inverse Gaussian distribution. We show that such a channel model is appropriate for molecular communication in fluid media - when propagation between transmitter and receiver is governed by Brownian motion and when there is positive drift from transmitter to receiver. Taking advantage of the available literature on the IG distribution, upper and lower bounds on channel capacity are developed, and a maximum likelihood receiver is derived. Theory and simulation results are presented which show that such a channel does not have a single quality measure analogous to signal-to-noise ratio in the AWGN channel. It is also shown that the use of multiple molecules leads to reduced error rate in a manner akin to diversity order in wireless communications. Finally, we discuss some open problems in molecular communications that arise from the IG system model.',

	{'abstract': u'We present a combinatorial characterization of the Bethe entropy function of a factor graph, such a characterization being in contrast to the original, analytical, definition of this function. We achieve this combinatorial characterization by counting valid configurations in finite graph covers of the factor graph. Analogously, we give a combinatorial characterization of the Bethe partition function, whose original definition was also of an analytical nature. As we point out, our approach has similarities to the replica method, but also stark differences. The above findings are a natural backdrop for introducing a decoder for graph-based codes that we will call symbolwise graph-cover decoding, a decoder that extends our earlier work on blockwise graph-cover decoding. Both graph-cover decoders are theoretical tools that help towards a better understanding of message-passing iterative decoding, namely blockwise graph-cover decoding links max-product (min-sum) algorithm decoding with linear programming decoding, and symbolwise graph-cover decoding links sum-product algorithm decoding with Bethe free energy function minimization at temperature one. In contrast to the Gibbs entropy function, which is a concave function, the Bethe entropy function is in general not concave everywhere. In particular, we show that every code picked from an ensemble of regular low-density parity-check codes with minimum Hamming distance growing (with high probability) linearly with the block length has a Bethe entropy function that is convex in certain regions of its domain.',

	{'abstract': u'Testing is one of the most indispensable tasks in software engineering. The role of testing in software development has grown significantly because testing is able to reveal defects in the code in an early stage of development. Many unit test frameworks compatible with C/C++ code exist, but a standard one is missing. Unfortunately, many unsolved problems can be mentioned with the existing methods, for example usually external tools are necessary for testing C++ programs. In this paper we present a new approach for testing C++ programs. Our solution is based on C++ template metaprogramming facilities, so it can work with the standard-compliant compilers. The metaprogramming approach ensures that the overhead of testing is minimal at runtime. This approach also supports that the specification language can be customized among other advantages. Nevertheless, the only necessary tool is the compiler itself.',

	{'abstract': u'In sparse light splitting all-optical WDM networks, the more destinations a light-tree can accommodate, the fewer light-trees andwavelengths amulticast session will require. In this article, a Hypo-Steiner light-tree algorithm (HSLT) is proposed to construct a HSLT light-tree to include as many destinations as possible. The upper bound cost of the light-trees built by HSLT is given as N(N -1)/2, where N is the number of nodes in the network. The analytical model proves that, under the same condition, more destinations could be held in a HSLT than a Member-Only (Zhang et al., J. Lightware Technol, 18(12), 1917-1927 2000.) light-tree. Extensive simulations not only validate the proof but also show that the proposed heuristic outperforms the existing multicast routing algorithms by a large margin in terms of link stress, throughput, and efficiency ofwavelength usage.',

	{'abstract': u"In this articlewestudy themulticast routing problem in all-opticalWDMnetworks under the spare light splitting constraint. To implement a multicast session, several light-trees may have to be used due to the limited fanouts of network nodes. Although many multicast routing algorithms have been proposed in order to reduce the total number of wavelength channels used (total cost) for a multicast session, the maximum number of wavelengths required in one fiber link (link stress) and the end-to-end delay are two parameters which are not always taken into consideration. It is known that the shortest path tree (SPT) results in the optimal end-to-end delay, but it can not be employed directly for multicast routing in sparse light splitting WDM networks. Hence, we propose a novel wavelength routing algorithm which tries to avoid the multicast incapable branching nodes (MIBs, branching nodes without splitting capability) in the shortest-path-based multicast tree to diminish the link stress. Good parts of the shortest-path-tree are retained by the algorithm to reduce the end-to-end delay. The algorithm consists of tree steps: (1) aDijkstraPro algorithmwith priority assignment and node adoption is introduced to produce a SPT with up to 38% fewer MIB nodes in the NSF topology and 46% fewerMIB nodes in the USA Longhaul topology, (2) critical articulation and deepest branch heuristics are used to process the MIB nodes, (3) a distance-based light-tree reconnection algorithm is proposed to create the multicast light-trees. Extensive simulations demonstrate the algorithm's efficiency in terms of link stress and end-to-end delay.",

	{'abstract': u'This paper is about the design and analysis of an index-assignment (IA) based multiple-description coding scheme for the n-channel asymmetric case. We use entropy constrained lattice vector quantization and restrict attention to simple reconstruction functions, which are given by the inverse IA function when all descriptions are received or otherwise by a weighted average of the received descriptions. We consider smooth sources with finite differential entropy rate and MSE fidelity criterion. As in previous designs, our construction is based on nested lattices which are combined through a single IA function. The results are exact under high-resolution conditions and asymptotically as the nesting ratios of the lattices approach infinity. For any n, the design is asymptotically optimal within the class of IA-based schemes. Moreover, in the case of two descriptions and finite lattice vector dimensions greater than one, the performance is strictly better than that of existing designs. In the case of three descriptions, we show that in the limit of large lattice vector dimensions, points on the inner bound of Pradhan et al. can be achieved. Furthermore, for three descriptions and finite lattice vector dimensions, we show that the IA-based approach yields, in the symmetric case, a smaller rate loss than the recently proposed source-splitting approach.',

	{'abstract': u'Based on the false assumption that multicast incapable (MI) nodes could not be traversed twice on the same wavelength, the light-tree structure was always thought to be optimal for multicast routing in sparse splitting Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) networks. In fact, for establishing a multicast session, an MI node could be crosswise visited more than once to switch a light signal towards several destinations with only one wavelength through different input and output pairs. This is called Cross Pair Switching (CPS). Thus, a new multicast routing structure light-hierarchy is proposed for all-optical multicast routing, which permits the cycles introduced by the CPS capability of MI nodes. We proved that the optimal structure for minimizing the cost of multicast routing is a set of light-hierarchies rather than the light-trees in sparse splitting WDM networks. Integer linear programming (ILP) formulations are developed to search the optimal light-hierarchies. Numerical results verified that the light-hierarchy structure could save more cost than the light-tree structure.',

	{'abstract': u'To minimize the number of wavelengths required by a multicast session in sparse light splitting wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) networks, a light-hierarchy structure, which occupies the same wavelength on all links, is proposed to span as many destinations as possible. Different from a light-tree, a light-hierarchy accepts cycles, which are used to traverse crosswise a 4-degree (or above) multicast incapable (MI) node twice (or above) and switch two light signals on the same wavelengths to two destinations in the same multicast session. In this paper, firstly, a graph renewal and distance priority light-tree algorithm (GRDP-LT) is introduced to improve the quality of light-trees built for a multicast request. Then, it is extended to compute light-hierarchies. Obtained numerical results demonstrate the GRDP-LT light-trees can achieve a much lower links stress, better wavelength channel cost, and smaller average end-to-end delay as well as diameter than the currently most efficient algorithm. Furthermore, compared to light-trees, the performance in terms of link stress and network throughput is greatly improved again by employing the light-hierarchy, while consuming the same amount of wavelength channel cost.',

	{'abstract': u'In this paper, secure transmission of information over fading broadcast channels is studied in the presence of statistical queueing constraints. Effective capacity is employed as a performance metric to identify the secure throughput of the system, i.e., effective secure throughput. It is assumed that perfect channel side information (CSI) is available at both the transmitter and the receivers. Initially, the scenario in which the transmitter sends common messages to two receivers and confidential messages to one receiver is considered. For this case, effective secure throughput region, which is the region of constant arrival rates of common and confidential messages that can be supported by the buffer-constrained transmitter and fading broadcast channel, is defined. It is proven that this effective throughput region is convex. Then, the optimal power control policies that achieve the boundary points of the effective secure throughput region are investigated and an algorithm for the numerical computation of the optimal power adaptation schemes is provided. Subsequently, the special case in which the transmitter sends only confidential messages to one receiver, is addressed in more detail. For this case, effective secure throughput is formulated and two different power adaptation policies are studied. In particular, it is noted that opportunistic transmission is no longer optimal under buffer constraints and the transmitter should not wait to send the data at a high rate until the main channel is much better than the eavesdropper channel.',

	{'abstract': u'The past few years have seen intensive research efforts carried out in some apparently unrelated areas of dynamic systems -- delay-tolerant networks, opportunistic-mobility networks, social networks -- obtaining closely related insights. Indeed, the concepts discovered in these investigations can be viewed as parts of the same conceptual universe; and the formal models proposed so far to express some specific concepts are components of a larger formal description of this universe. The main contribution of this paper is to integrate the vast collection of concepts, formalisms, and results found in the literature into a unified framework, which we call TVG (for time-varying graphs). Using this framework, it is possible to express directly in the same formalism not only the concepts common to all those different areas, but also those specific to each. Based on this definitional work, employing both existing results and original observations, we present a hierarchical classification of TVGs; each class corresponds to a significant property examined in the distributed computing literature. We then examine how TVGs can be used to study the evolution of network properties, and propose different techniques, depending on whether the indicators for these properties are a-temporal (as in the majority of existing studies) or temporal. Finally, we briefly discuss the introduction of randomness in TVGs.',

	{'abstract': u"We present a multi-level graph partitioning algorithm using novel local improvement algorithms and global search strategies transferred from the multi-grid community. Local improvement algorithms are based max-flow min-cut computations and more localized FM searches. By combining these techniques, we obtain an algorithm that is fast on the one hand and on the other hand is able to improve the best known partitioning results for many inputs. For example, in Walshaw's well known benchmark tables we achieve 317 improvements for the tables 1%, 3% and 5% imbalance. Moreover, in 118 additional cases we have been able to reproduce the best cut in this benchmark.",

We discuss conjecturally tight bounds on the maximal number of non-degenerate roots F can have over L, with all coordinates having fixed phase, as a function of n, k, and L only. In particular, we give new explicit systems with number of roots approaching the best known upper bounds. We also briefly review the background behind such bounds, and their application, including connections to computational number theory and variants of the Shub-Smale tau-Conjecture and the P vs. NP Problem. One of our key tools is the construction of combinatorially constrained tropical varieties with maximally many intersections.',

	{'abstract': u'In this paper, the problem of constructing an efficient quantum circuit for the implementation of an arbitrary quantum computation is addressed. To this end, a basic block based on the cosine-sine decomposition method is suggested which contains qubits. In addition, a previously proposed quantum-logic synthesis method based on quantum Shannon decomposition is recursively applied to reach unitary gates over qubits. Then, the basic block is used and some optimizations are applied to remove redundant gates. It is shown that the exact value of affects the number of one-qubit and CNOT gates in the proposed method. In comparison to the previous synthesis methods, the value of is examined consequently to improve either the number of CNOT gates or the total number of gates. The proposed approach is further analyzed by considering the nearest neighbor limitation. According to our evaluation, the number of CNOT gates is increased by at most a factor of if the nearest neighbor interaction is applied.',

	{'abstract': u'We present a protocol for performing state merging when multiple parties share a single copy of a mixed state, and analyze the entanglement cost in terms of min- and max-entropies. Our protocol allows for interpolation between corner points of the rate region without the need for time-sharing, a primitive which is not available in the one-shot setting. We also compare our protocol to the more naive strategy of repeatedly applying a single-party merging protocol one party at a time, by performing a detailed analysis of the rates required to merge variants of the embezzling states. Finally, we analyze a variation of multiparty merging, which we call split-transfer, by considering two receivers and many additional helpers sharing a mixed state. We give a protocol for performing a split-transfer and apply it to the problem of assisted entanglement distillation.',

	{'abstract': u'Motivated by the problem of designing quantum repeaters, we study entanglement distillation between two parties, Alice and Bob, starting from a mixed state and with the help of "repeater" stations. To treat the case of a single repeater, we extend the notion of entanglement of assistance to arbitrary mixed tripartite states and exhibit a protocol, based on a random coding strategy, for extracting pure entanglement. The rates achievable by this protocol formally resemble those achievable if the repeater station could merge its state to one of Alice and Bob even when such merging is impossible. This rate is provably better than the hashing bound for sufficiently pure tripartite states. We also compare our assisted distillation protocol to a hierarchical strategy consisting of entanglement distillation followed by entanglement swapping. We demonstrate by the use of a simple example that our random measurement strategy outperforms hierarchical distillation strategies when the individual helper stations\' states fail to individually factorize into portions associated specifically with Alice and Bob. Finally, we use these results to find achievable rates for the more general scenario, where many spatially separated repeaters help two recipients distill entanglement.',

Based on this principle a Lyapunov-based nonlinear adaptive controller is developed that only needs control derivatives of the kite aerodynamic model. The resulting controller is validated using simulations with a point-mass kite model.',

	{'abstract': u'The Kuramoto model captures various synchronization phenomena in biological and man-made systems of coupled oscillators. It is well-known that there exists a critical coupling strength among the oscillators at which a phase transition from incoherency to synchronization occurs. This paper features four contributions. First, we characterize and distinguish the different notions of synchronization used throughout the literature and formally introduce the concept of phase cohesiveness as an analysis tool and performance index for synchronization. Second, we review the vast literature providing necessary, sufficient, implicit, and explicit estimates of the critical coupling strength for finite and infinite-dimensional, and for first and second-order Kuramoto models. Third, we present the first explicit necessary and sufficient condition on the critical coupling to achieve synchronization in the finite-dimensional Kuramoto model for an arbitrary distribution of the natural frequencies. The multiplicative gap in the synchronization condition yields a practical stability result determining the admissible initial and the guaranteed ultimate phase cohesiveness as well as the guaranteed asymptotic magnitude of the order parameter. Fourth and finally, we extend our analysis to multi-rate Kuramoto models consisting of second-order Kuramoto oscillators with inertia and viscous damping together with first-order Kuramoto oscillators with multiple time constants. We prove that the multi-rate Kuramoto model is locally topologically conjugate to a first-order Kuramoto model with scaled natural frequencies, and we present necessary and sufficient conditions for almost global phase synchronization and local frequency synchronization. Interestingly, these conditions do not depend on the inertiae which contradicts prior observations on the role of inertiae in synchronization of second-order Kuramoto models.',

	{'abstract': u'We present a quasipolynomial-time algorithm for solving the weak membership problem for the convex set of separable, i.e. non-entangled, bipartite density matrices. The algorithm decides whether a density matrix is separable or whether it is eps-away from the set of the separable states in time exp(O(eps^-2 log |A| log |B|)), where |A| and |B| are the local dimensions, and the distance is measured with either the Euclidean norm, or with the so-called LOCC norm. The latter is an operationally motivated norm giving the optimal probability of distinguishing two bipartite quantum states, each shared by two parties, using any protocol formed by quantum local operations and classical communication (LOCC) between the parties. We also obtain improved algorithms for optimizing over the set of separable states and for computing the ground-state energy of mean-field Hamiltonians. The techniques we develop are also applied to quantum Merlin-Arthur games, where we show that multiple provers are not more powerful than a single prover when the verifier is restricted to LOCC protocols, or when the verification procedure is formed by a measurement of small Euclidean norm. This answers a question posed by Aaronson et al (Theory of Computing 5, 1, 2009) and provides two new characterizations of the complexity class QMA, a quantum analog of NP. Our algorithm uses semidefinite programming to search for a symmetric extension, as first proposed by Doherty, Parrilo and Spedialieri (Phys. Rev. A, 69, 022308, 2004). The bound on the runtime follows from an improved de Finetti-type bound quantifying the monogamy of quantum entanglement, proved in (arXiv:1010.1750). This result, in turn, follows from a new lower bound on the quantum conditional mutual information and the entanglement measure squashed entanglement.',

	{'abstract': u'Mean field games is a recent area of study introduced by Lions and Lasry in a series of seminal papers in 2006. Mean field games model situations of competition between large number of rational agents that play non-cooperative dynamic games under certain symmetry assumptions. They key step is to develop a mean field model, in a similar way that what is done in statistical physics in order to construct a mathematically tractable model. A main question that arises in the study of such mean field problems is the rigorous justification of the mean field models by a limiting procedure. In this paper we consider the mean field limit of two-state Markov decision problem as the number of players . First we establish the existence and uniqueness of a symmetric partial information Markov perfect equilibrium. Then we derive a mean field model and characterize its main properties. This mean field limit is a system of coupled ordinary differential equations with initial-terminal data. Our main result is the convergence as of the player game to the mean field model and an estimate of the rate of convergence.',

	{'abstract': u'Multiple kernel learning (MKL), structured sparsity, and multi-task learning have recently received considerable attention. In this paper, we show how different MKL algorithms can be understood as applications of either regularization on the kernel weights or block-norm-based regularization, which is more common in structured sparsity and multi-task learning. We show that these two regularization strategies can be systematically mapped to each other through a concave conjugate operation. When the kernel-weight-based regularizer is separable into components, we can naturally consider a generative probabilistic model behind MKL. Based on this model, we propose learning algorithms for the kernel weights through the maximization of marginal likelihood. We show through numerical experiments that -norm MKL and Elastic-net MKL achieve comparable accuracy to uniform kernel combination. Although uniform kernel combination might be preferable from its simplicity, -norm MKL and Elastic-net MKL can learn the usefulness of the information sources represented as kernels. In particular, Elastic-net MKL achieves sparsity in the kernel weights.',

	{'abstract': u'We realize a biochemical filtering process by introducing a buffer in a biocatalytic signal-transduction logic system based on the function of an enzyme, esterase. The input, ethyl butyrate, is converted into butyric acid-the output signal, which in turn is measured by the drop in the pH value. The developed approach offers a versatile "network element" for increasing the complexity of biochemical information processing systems. Evaluation of an optimal regime for quality filtering is accomplished in the framework of a kinetic rate-equation model.',

	{'abstract': u'We extend the Hopf algebra description of a simple quantum system given previously, to a more elaborate Hopf algebra, which is rich enough to encompass that related to a description of perturbative quantum field theory (pQFT). This provides a route from an algebraic description of non-relativistic, non-field theoretic quantum statistical mechanics to one of relativistic quantum field theory. Such a description necessarily involves treating the algebra of polyzeta functions, extensions of the Riemann Zeta function, since these occur naturally in pQFT. This provides a link between physics, algebra and number theory. As a by-product of this approach, we are led to indicate a basis for concluding that the Euler gamma constant may be rational.',

	{'abstract': u'Bayesian networks are basic graphical models, used widely both in statistics and artificial intelligence. These statistical models of conditional independence structure are described by acyclic directed graphs whose nodes correspond to (random) variables in consideration. A quite important topic is the learning of Bayesian network structures, which is determining the best fitting statistical model on the basis of given data. Although there are learning methods based on statistical conditional independence tests, contemporary methods are mainly based on maximization of a suitable quality criterion that evaluates how good the graph explains the occurrence of the observed data. This leads to a nonlinear combinatorial optimization problem that is in general NP-hard to solve. In this paper we deal with the complexity of learning restricted Bayesian network structures, that is, we wish to find network structures of highest score within a given subset of all possible network structures. For this, we introduce a new unique algebraic representative for these structures, called the characteristic imset. We show that these imsets are always 0-1-vectors and that they have many nice properties that allow us to simplify long proofs for some known results and to easily establish new complexity results for learning restricted Bayes network structures.',

	{'abstract': u'The problem of computing a representation for a real polynomial as a sum of minimum number of squares of polynomials can be casted as finding a symmetric positive semidefinite real matrix (Gram matrix) of minimum rank subject to linear equality constraints. In this paper, we propose algorithms for solving the minimum-rank Gram matrix completion problem, and show the convergence of these algorithms. Our methods are based on the modified fixed point continuation (FPC) method. We also use the Barzilai-Borwein (BB) technique and a specific linear combination of two previous iterates to accelerate the convergence of modified FPC algorithms. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithms for computing approximate and exact rational sum of squares (SOS) decompositions of polynomials with rational coefficients.',

AMP's web-based interface was developed as a traditional standalone database-backed web application using the Python-based Django web development framework, allowing us to leverage the Django framework's capabilities while cleanly separating the user interface development from the grid interface development.

	{'abstract': u'Nuclear norm minimization (NNM) has recently gained significant attention for its use in rank minimization problems. Similar to compressed sensing, using null space characterizations, recovery thresholds for NNM have been studied in cite. However simulations show that the thresholds are far from optimal, especially in the low rank region. In this paper we apply the recent analysis of Stojnic for compressed sensing cite to the null space conditions of NNM. The resulting thresholds are significantly better and in particular our weak threshold appears to match with simulation results. Further our curves suggest for any rank growing linearly with matrix size we need only three times of oversampling (the model complexity) for weak recovery. Similar to cite we analyze the conditions for weak, sectional and strong thresholds. Additionally a separate analysis is given for special case of positive semidefinite matrices. We conclude by discussing simulation results and future research directions.',

	{'abstract': u'Large-scale data resulting from users online interactions provide the ultimate source of information to study emergent social phenomena on the Web. From individual actions of users to observable collective behaviors, different mechanisms involving emotions expressed in the posted text play a role. Here we combine approaches of statistical physics with machine-learning methods of text analysis to study emergence of the emotional behavior among Web users. Mapping the high-resolution data from digg.com onto bipartite network of users and their comments onto posted stories, we identify user communities centered around certain popular posts and determine emotional contents of the related comments by the emotion-classifier developed for this type of texts. Applied over different time periods, this framework reveals strong correlations between the excess of negative emotions and the evolution of communities. We observe avalanches of emotional comments exhibiting significant self-organized critical behavior and temporal correlations. To explore robustness of these critical states, we design a network automaton model on realistic network connections and several control parameters, which can be inferred from the dataset. Dissemination of emotions by a small fraction of very active users appears to critically tune the collective states.',

Following up the work presented at ACAT 2008, we use the multivariate technique presented there (a rule growing algorithm with the meta-methods bagging and instance weighting) on much more imbalanced data sets, especially a selection of D0 decays without the use of particle identification. It turns out that the quality of the result strongly depends on the number of background instances used for training. We discuss methods to exploit this in order to improve the results significantly, and how to handle and reduce the size of large training sets without loss of result quality in general. We will also comment on how to take into account statistical fluctuation in receiver operation characteristic curves (ROC) for comparing classifier methods.',

	{'abstract': u'Statistical models of natural stimuli provide an important tool for researchers in the fields of machine learning and computational neuroscience. A canonical way to quantitatively assess and compare the performance of statistical models is given by the likelihood. One class of statistical models which has recently gained increasing popularity and has been applied to a variety of complex data are deep belief networks. Analyses of these models, however, have been typically limited to qualitative analyses based on samples due to the computationally intractable nature of the model likelihood. Motivated by these circumstances, the present article provides a consistent estimator for the likelihood that is both computationally tractable and simple to apply in practice. Using this estimator, a deep belief network which has been suggested for the modeling of natural image patches is quantitatively investigated and compared to other models of natural image patches. Contrary to earlier claims based on qualitative results, the results presented in this article provide evidence that the model under investigation is not a particularly good model for natural images',

Barvinok [Computing the Ehrhart quasi-polynomial of a rational simplex, Math. Comp. 75 (2006), 1449--1466]. For a given semi-rational polytope P and a rational subspace L, we integrate a given polynomial function h over all lattice slices of the polytope P parallel to the subspace L and sum up the integrals. We first develop an algorithmic theory of parametric intermediate generating functions. Then we study the Ehrhart theory of these intermediate sums, that is, the dependence of the result as a function of a dilation of the polytope. We provide an algorithm to compute the resulting Ehrhart quasi-polynomials in the form of explicit step polynomials. These formulas are naturally valid for real (not just integer) dilations and thus provide a direct approach to real Ehrhart theory.',

	{'abstract': u'The science of networks has revolutionised research into the dynamics of interacting elements. It could be argued that epidemiology in particular has embraced the potential of network theory more than any other discipline. Here we review the growing body of research concerning the spread of infectious diseases on networks, focusing on the interplay between network theory and epidemiology. The review is split into four main sections, which examine: the types of network relevant to epidemiology; the multitude of ways these networks can be characterised; the statistical methods that can be applied to infer the epidemiological parameters on a realised network; and finally simulation and analytical methods to determine epidemic dynamics on a given network. Given the breadth of areas covered and the ever-expanding number of publications, a comprehensive review of all work is impossible. Instead, we provide a personalised overview into the areas of network epidemiology that have seen the greatest progress in recent years or have the greatest potential to provide novel insights. As such, considerable importance is placed on analytical approaches and statistical methods which are both rapidly expanding fields. Throughout this review we restrict our attention to epidemiological issues.',

	{'abstract': u'This article concerns the resolution of impartial combinatorial games, and in particular games that can be split in sums of independent positions. We prove that in order to compute the outcome of a sum of independent positions, it is always more efficient to compute separately the nimbers of each independent position than to develop directly the game tree of the sum. The concept of nimber is therefore inevitable to solve impartial games, even when we only try to determinate the winning or losing outcome of a starting position. We also describe algorithms to use nimbers efficiently and finally, we give a review of the results obtained on two impartial games: Sprouts and Cram.',

	{'abstract': u'The aim of this chapter is to show how option prices in jump-diffusion models can be computed using meshless methods based on Radial Basis Function (RBF) interpolation. The RBF technique is demonstrated by solving the partial integro-differential equation (PIDE) in one-dimension for the American put and the European vanilla call/put options on dividend-paying stocks in the Merton and Kou jump-diffusion models. The radial basis function we select is the Cubic Spline. We also propose a simple numerical algorithm for finding a finite computational range of an improper integral term in the PIDE so that the accuracy of approximation of the integral can be improved. Moreover, the solution functions of the PIDE are approximated explicitly by RBFs which have exact forms so we can easily compute the global integral by any kind of numerical quadrature. Finally, we will not only show numerically that our scheme is second order accurate in both spatial and time variables in a European case but also second order accurate in spatial variables and first order accurate in time variables in an American case.',

	{'abstract': u'One of the most important open questions in the theory of quantum convolutional coding is to determine a minimal-memory, non-catastrophic, polynomial-depth convolutional encoder for an arbitrary quantum convolutional code. Here, we present a technique that finds quantum convolutional encoders with such desirable properties for several example quantum convolutional codes (an exposition of our technique in full generality will appear elsewhere). We first show how to encode the well-studied Forney-Grassl-Guha (FGG) code with an encoder that exploits just one memory qubit (the former Grassl-Roetteler encoder requires 15 memory qubits). We then show how our technique can find an online decoder corresponding to this encoder, and we also detail the operation of our technique on a different example of a quantum convolutional code. Finally, the reduction in memory for the FGG encoder makes it feasible to simulate the performance of a quantum turbo code employing it, and we present the results of such simulations.',

	{'abstract': u'A large set of signals can sometimes be described sparsely using a dictionary, that is, every element can be represented as a linear combination of few elements from the dictionary. Algorithms for various signal processing applications, including classification, denoising and signal separation, learn a dictionary from a set of signals to be represented. Can we expect that the representation found by such a dictionary for a previously unseen example from the same source will have L_2 error of the same magnitude as those for the given examples? We assume signals are generated from a fixed distribution, and study this questions from a statistical learning theory perspective. We develop generalization bounds on the quality of the learned dictionary for two types of constraints on the coefficient selection, as measured by the expected L_2 error in representation when the dictionary is used. For the case of l_1 regularized coefficient selection we provide a generalization bound of the order of O(sqrt(np log(m lambda)/m)), where n is the dimension, p is the number of elements in the dictionary, lambda is a bound on the l_1 norm of the coefficient vector and m is the number of samples, which complements existing results. For the case of representing a new signal as a combination of at most k dictionary elements, we provide a bound of the order O(sqrt(np log(m k)/m)) under an assumption on the level of orthogonality of the dictionary (low Babel function). We further show that this assumption holds for most dictionaries in high dimensions in a strong probabilistic sense. Our results further yield fast rates of order 1/m as opposed to 1/sqrt(m) using localized Rademacher complexity. We provide similar results in a general setting using kernels with weak smoothness requirements.',

	{'abstract': u"The aim of this study is to make a bibliometric comparison of the performance of research astronomers in the Netherlands Research School for Astronomy (NOVA) with astronomers elsewhere by using the NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS). We use various indices for bibliometric performance for a sample of NOVA astronomers to compare to samples of astronomers worldwide, and from the United States. We give much weight to normalising bibliometric measures by number of authors, and number of years since first publication. In particular we calculate the `Hirsh-index' normalized to number of authors and for first-author papers. Secondly, we consider the results of the 'Nederlands Observatorium van Wetenschap en Technologie' (NOWT; Netherlands Observatory of Science and Technology), which regularly publishes a report 'Science and Technology Indicators'. We reproduce those results using publication lists from institutions in the Netherlands, again using ADS, and examine and discuss the conclusions and indications in these reports. We find that the NOVA researchers perform much better in bibliometric measures than samples drawn from IAU or AAS membership lists. A more suitable comparison is one with the (tenured) staff of the top-15 US institutions and there the NOVA staff performs in these respects as good or almost as good as that of American top institutes. From a citation analysis through the use of ADS we conclude that the impact ratio of Dutch astronomical publications is rising which is opposite to what is reported by NOWT. This difference is most likely caused by a better separation of astronomy and physics in ADS than in World of Knowledge. ADS probably finds more citations in conference proceedings, while the inclusion of citations to articles with their pre-print identifier could also help explain the difference (especially since the citation windows in the reports are short).",

	{'abstract': u'This chapter describes how astronomical imaging survey data have become a vital part of modern astronomy, how these data are archived and then served to the astronomical community through on-line data access portals. The Virtual Observatory, now under development, aims to make all these data accessible through a uniform set of interfaces. This chapter also describes the scientific need for one common image processing task, that of composing individual images into large scale mosaics and introduces Montage as a tool for this task. Montage, as distributed, can be used in four ways: as a single thread/process on a single CPU, in parallel using MPI to distribute similar tasks across a parallel computer, in parallel using grid tools (Pegasus/DAGMan) to distributed tasks across a grid, or in parallel using a script-driven approach (Swift). An on-request web based Montage service is available for users who do not need to build a local version. We also introduce some work on a new scripted version of Montage, which offers ease of customization for users. Then, we discuss various ideas where Web 2.0 technologies can help the Montage community.',

	{'abstract': u'Many clustering schemes are defined by optimizing an objective function defined on the partitions of the underlying set of a finite metric space. In this paper, we construct a framework for studying what happens when we instead impose various structural conditions on the clustering schemes, under the general heading of functoriality. Functoriality refers to the idea that one should be able to compare the results of clustering algorithms as one varies the data set, for example by adding points or by applying functions to it. We show that within this framework, one can prove a theorems analogous to one of J. Kleinberg, in which for example one obtains an existence and uniqueness theorem instead of a non-existence result. We obtain a full classification of all clustering schemes satisfying a condition we refer to as excisiveness. The classification can be changed by varying the notion of maps of finite metric spaces. The conditions occur naturally when one considers clustering as the statistical version of the geometric notion of connected components. By varying the degree of functoriality that one requires from the schemes it is possible to construct richer families of clustering schemes that exhibit sensitivity to density.',

	{'abstract': u'We obtain the degree distribution for a class of growing network models on flat and curved spaces. These models evolve by preferential attachment weighted by a function of the distance between nodes. The degree distribution of these models is similar to the one of the fitness model of Bianconi and Barabasi, with a fitness distribution dependent on the metric and the density of nodes. We show that curvature singularities in these spaces can give rise to asymptotic Bose-Einstein condensation, but transient condensation can be observed also in smooth hyperbolic spaces with strong curvature. We provide numerical results for spaces of constant curvature (sphere, flat and hyperbolic space) and we discuss the conditions for the breakdown of this approach and the critical points of the transition to distance-dominated attachment. Finally we discuss the distribution of link lengths.',

	{'abstract': u'Cellular automata have been mainly studied on very regular graphs carrying the vertices (like lines or grids) and under synchronous dynamics (all vertices update simultaneously). In this paper, we study how the asynchronism and the graph act upon the dynamics of the classical Minority rule. Minority has been well-studied for synchronous updates and is thus a reasonable choice to begin with. Yet, beyond its apparent simplicity, this rule yields complex behaviors when asynchronism is introduced. We investigate the transitory part as well as the asymptotic behavior of the dynamics under full asynchronism (also called sequential: only one random vertex updates at each time step) for several types of graphs. Such a comparative study is a first step in understanding how the asynchronous dynamics is linked to the topology (the graph). Previous analyses on the grid [1,2] have observed that Minority seems to induce fast stabilization. We investigate here this property on arbitrary graphs using tools such as energy, particles and random walks. We show that the worst case convergence time is, in fact, strongly dependent on the topology. In particular, we observe that the case of trees is non trivial.',

	{'abstract': u'We consider the restless multi-armed bandit (RMAB) problem with unknown dynamics in which a player chooses M out of N arms to play at each time. The reward state of each arm transits according to an unknown Markovian rule when it is played and evolves according to an arbitrary unknown random process when it is passive. The performance of an arm selection policy is measured by regret, defined as the reward loss with respect to the case where the player knows which M arms are the most rewarding and always plays the M best arms. We construct a policy with an interleaving exploration and exploitation epoch structure that achieves a regret with logarithmic order when arbitrary (but nontrivial) bounds on certain system parameters are known. When no knowledge about the system is available, we show that the proposed policy achieves a regret arbitrarily close to the logarithmic order. We further extend the problem to a decentralized setting where multiple distributed players share the arms without information exchange. Under both an exogenous restless model and an endogenous restless model, we show that a decentralized extension of the proposed policy preserves the logarithmic regret order as in the centralized setting. The results apply to adaptive learning in various dynamic systems and communication networks, as well as financial investment.',

	{'abstract': u'Social groups are fundamental building blocks of human societies. While our social interactions have always been constrained by geography, it has been impossible, due to practical difficulties, to evaluate the nature of this restriction on social group structure. We construct a social network of individuals whose most frequent geographical locations are also known. We also classify the individuals into groups according to a community detection algorithm. We study the variation of geographical span for social groups of varying sizes, and explore the relationship between topological positions and geographic positions of their members. We find that small social groups are geographically very tight, but become much more clumped when the group size exceeds about 30 members. Also, we find no correlation between the topological positions and geographic positions of individuals within network communities. These results suggest that spreading processes face distinct structural and spatial constraints.',

	{'abstract': u'In the classic Bayesian restless multi-armed bandit (RMAB) problem, there are arms, with rewards on all arms evolving at each time as Markov chains with known parameters. A player seeks to activate arms at each time in order to maximize the expected total reward obtained over multiple plays. RMAB is a challenging problem that is known to be PSPACE-hard in general. We consider in this work the even harder non-Bayesian RMAB, in which the parameters of the Markov chain are assumed to be unknown emph. We develop an original approach to this problem that is applicable when the corresponding Bayesian problem has the structure that, depending on the known parameter values, the optimal solution is one of a prescribed finite set of policies. In such settings, we propose to learn the optimal policy for the non-Bayesian RMAB by employing a suitable meta-policy which treats each policy from this finite set as an arm in a different non-Bayesian multi-armed bandit problem for which a single-arm selection policy is optimal. We demonstrate this approach by developing a novel sensing policy for opportunistic spectrum access over unknown dynamic channels. We prove that our policy achieves near-logarithmic regret (the difference in expected reward compared to a model-aware genie), which leads to the same average reward that can be achieved by the optimal policy under a known model. This is the first such result in the literature for a non-Bayesian RMAB.',

	{'abstract': u'In the classic multi-armed bandits problem, the goal is to have a policy for dynamically operating arms that each yield stochastic rewards with unknown means. The key metric of interest is regret, defined as the gap between the expected total reward accumulated by an omniscient player that knows the reward means for each arm, and the expected total reward accumulated by the given policy. The policies presented in prior work have storage, computation and regret all growing linearly with the number of arms, which is not scalable when the number of arms is large. We consider in this work a broad class of multi-armed bandits with dependent arms that yield rewards as a linear combination of a set of unknown parameters. For this general framework, we present efficient policies that are shown to achieve regret that grows logarithmically with time, and polynomially in the number of unknown parameters (even though the number of dependent arms may grow exponentially). Furthermore, these policies only require storage that grows linearly in the number of unknown parameters. We show that this generalization is broadly applicable and useful for many interesting tasks in networks that can be formulated as tractable combinatorial optimization problems with linear objective functions, such as maximum weight matching, shortest path, and minimum spanning tree computations.',

	{'abstract': u'Category computation theory deals with a web-based systemic processing that underlies the morphic webs, which constitute the basis of categorial logical calculus. It is proven that, for these structures, algorithmically incompressible binary patterns can be morphically compressed, with respect to the local connectivities, in a binary morphic program. From the local connectivites, there emerges a global morphic connection that can be characterized by a low length binary string, leading to the identification of chaotic categorial dynamics, underlying the algorithmically random pattern. The work focuses on infinite binary chains of C2, which is a category that implements an X-OR-based categorial logical calculus.',

	{'abstract': u'We present asymptotic and finite-sample results on the use of stochastic blockmodels for the analysis of network data. We show that the fraction of misclassified network nodes converges in probability to zero under maximum likelihood fitting when the number of classes is allowed to grow as the root of the network size and the average network degree grows at least poly-logarithmically in this size. We also establish finite-sample confidence bounds on maximum-likelihood blockmodel parameter estimates from data comprising independent Bernoulli random variates; these results hold uniformly over class assignment. We provide simulations verifying the conditions sufficient for our results, and conclude by fitting a logit parameterization of a stochastic blockmodel with covariates to a network data example comprising a collection of Facebook profiles, resulting in block estimates that reveal residual structure.',

	{'abstract': u'Recent analysis of social communications among humans has revealed that the interval between interactions for a pair of individuals and for an individual often follows a long-tail distribution. We investigate the effect of such a non-Poissonian nature of human behavior on dynamics of opinion formation. We use a variant of the voter model and numerically compare the time to consensus of all the voters with different distributions of interevent intervals and different networks. Compared with the exponential distribution of interevent intervals (i.e., the standard voter model), the power-law distribution of interevent intervals slows down consensus on the ring. This is because of the memory effect; in the power-law case, the expected time until the next update event on a link is large if the link has not had an update event for a long time. On the complete graph, the consensus time in the power-law case is close to that in the exponential case. Regular graphs bridge these two results such that the slowing down of the consensus in the power-law case as compared to the exponential case is less pronounced as the degree increases.',

	{'abstract': u'In this paper we explore the concept of hierarchy as a quantifiable descriptor of ordered structures, departing from the definition of three conditions to be satisfied for a hierarchical structure: , and . According to these principles we define a hierarchical index taking concepts from graph and information theory. This estimator allows to quantify the hierarchical character of any system susceptible to be abstracted in a feedforward causal graph, i.e., a directed acyclic graph defined in a single connected structure. Our hierarchical index is a balance between this predictability and pyramidal condition by the definition of two entropies: one attending the onward flow and other for the backward reversion. We show how this index allows to identify hierarchical, anti-hierarchical and non hierarchical structures. Our formalism reveals that departing from the defined conditions for a hierarchical structure, feedforward trees and the inverted tree graphs emerge as the only causal structures of maximal hierarchical and anti-hierarchical systems, respectively. Conversely, null values of the hierarchical index are attributed to a number of different configuration networks; from linear chains, due to their lack of pyramid structure, to full-connected feedforward graphs where the diversity of onward pathways is canceled by the uncertainty (lack of predictability) when going backwards. Some illustrative examples are provided for the distinction among these three types of hierarchical causal graphs.',

	{'abstract': u'It is important to have fast and effective methods for simplifying 3-manifold triangulations without losing any topological information. In theory this is difficult: we might need to make a triangulation super-exponentially more complex before we can make it smaller than its original size. Here we present experimental work suggesting that for 3-sphere triangulations the reality is far different: we never need to add more than two tetrahedra, and we never need more than a handful of local modifications. If true in general, these extremely surprising results would have significant implications for decision algorithms and the study of triangulations in 3-manifold topology. The algorithms behind these experiments are interesting in their own right. Key techniques include the isomorph-free generation of all 3-manifold triangulations of a given size, polynomial-time computable signatures that identify triangulations uniquely up to isomorphism, and parallel algorithms for studying finite level sets in the infinite Pachner graph.',

By posing a suitable null hypothesis, our method makes use of the hypergeometric distribution to assess the probability that a given property is over-expressed in the elements of a community with respect to all the elements of the investigated set. We apply our method to two specific complex networks, namely a network of world movies and a network of physics preprints. The characterization of the elements and of the communities is done in terms of languages and countries for the movie network and of journals and subject categories for papers. We find that our method is able to characterize clearly the identified communities. Moreover our method works well both for large and for small communities.',

The best known classical algorithms for graph isomorphism all run in time super-polynomial in the size of the graph in the worst case. An interesting open problem is whether quantum computers can solve the graph isomorphism problem in polynomial time. In this paper, an algorithm is shown which can decide if two rooted trees are isomorphic in polynomial time. Although this problem is easy to solve efficiently on a classical computer, the techniques developed may be useful as a basis for quantum algorithms for deciding isomorphism of more interesting types of graphs. The related problem of quantum state symmetrization is also studied. A polynomial time algorithm for the problem of symmetrizing a set of orthonormal states over an arbitrary permutation group is shown.',

	{'abstract': u'String diagrams are a powerful tool for reasoning about physical processes, logic circuits, tensor networks, and many other compositional structures. The distinguishing feature of these diagrams is that edges need not be connected to vertices at both ends, and these unconnected ends can be interpreted as the inputs and outputs of a diagram. In this paper, we give a concrete construction for string diagrams using a special kind of typed graph called an open-graph. While the category of open-graphs is not itself adhesive, we introduce the notion of a selective adhesive functor, and show that such a functor embeds the category of open-graphs into the ambient adhesive category of typed graphs. Using this functor, the category of open-graphs inherits "enough adhesivity" from the category of typed graphs to perform double-pushout (DPO) graph rewriting. A salient feature of our theory is that it ensures rewrite systems are "type-safe" in the sense that rewriting respects the inputs and outputs. This formalism lets us safely encode the interesting structure of a computational model, such as evaluation dynamics, with succinct, explicit rewrite rules, while the graphical representation absorbs many of the tedious details. Although topological formalisms exist for string diagrams, our construction is discreet, finitary, and enjoys decidable algorithms for composition and rewriting. We also show how open-graphs can be parametrised by graphical signatures, similar to the monoidal signatures of Joyal and Street, which define types for vertices in the diagrammatic language and constraints on how they can be connected. Using typed open-graphs, we can construct free symmetric monoidal categories, PROPs, and more general monoidal theories. Thus open-graphs give us a handle for mechanised reasoning in monoidal categories.',

	{'abstract': u'The Magnetic Tower of Hanoi puzzle - a modified "base 3" version of the classical Tower of Hanoi puzzle as described in earlier papers, is actually a small set of independent sister-puzzles, depending on the "pre-coloring" combination of the tower\'s posts. Starting with Red facing up on a Source post, working through an Intermediate - colored or Neutral post, and ending Blue facing up on a Destination post, we identify the different pre-coloring combinations in (S,I,D) order. The Tower\'s pre-coloring combinations are . In this paper we investigate these sister-puzzles, identify the algorithm that optimally solves each pre-colored puzzle, and prove its Optimality. As it turns out, five of the six algorithms, challenging on their own, are part of the algorithm solving the "natural", Free Magnetic Tower of Hanoi puzzle [N,N,N]. We start by showing that the N-disk Colored Tower [(R,B,B) / (R,R,B)] is solved by (3^N - 1)/2 moves. Defining "Algorithm Duration" as the ratio of number of algorithm-moves solving the puzzle to the number of algorithm-moves solving the Colored Tower, we find the Duration-Limits for all sister-puzzles. In the order of the list above they are . Thus, the Duration-Limit of the Optimal Algorithm solving the Free Magnetic Tower of Hanoi puzzle is 20/33 or 606 0/00. On the road to optimally solve this colorful Magnetic puzzle, we hit other "forward-moving" puzzle-solving algorithms. Overall we looked at 10 pairs of integer sequences. Of the twenty integer sequences, five are listed in the On-line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences, the other fifteen - not yet. The large set of different solutions is a clear indication to the freedom-of-wondering that makes this Magnetic Tower of Hanoi puzzle so colorful.',

	{'abstract': u"The well-known Ising model used in statistical physics was adapted to a social dynamics context to simulate the adoption of a technological innovation. The model explicitly combines (a) an individual's perception of the advantages of an innovation and (b) social influence from members of the decision-maker's social network. The micro-level adoption dynamics are embedded into an agent-based model that allows exploration of macro-level patterns of technology diffusion throughout systems with different configurations (number and distributions of early adopters, social network topologies). In the present work we carry out many numerical simulations. We find that when the gap between the individual's perception of the options is high, the adoption speed increases if the dispersion of early adopters grows. Another test was based on changing the network topology by means of stochastic connections to a common opinion reference (hub), which resulted in an increment in the adoption speed. Finally, we performed a simulation of competition between options for both regular and small world networks.",

	{'abstract': u"We study a random code ensemble with a hierarchical structure, which is closely related to the generalized random energy model with discrete energy values. Based on this correspondence, we analyze the hierarchical random code ensemble by using the replica method in two situations: lossy data compression and channel coding. For both the situations, the exponents of large deviation analysis characterizing the performance of the ensemble, the distortion rate of lossy data compression and the error exponent of channel coding in Gallager's formalism, are accessible by a generating function of the generalized random energy model. We discuss that the transitions of those exponents observed in the preceding work can be interpreted as phase transitions with respect to the replica number. We also show that the replica symmetry breaking plays an essential role in these transitions.",

	{'abstract': u'Mean-field analysis is an important tool for understanding dynamics on complex networks. However, surprisingly little attention has been paid to the question of whether mean-field predictions are accurate, and this is particularly true for real-world networks with clustering and modular structure. In this paper, we compare mean-field predictions to numerical simulation results for dynamical processes running on 21 real-world networks and demonstrate that the accuracy of the theory depends not only on the mean degree of the networks but also on the mean first-neighbor degree. We show that mean-field theory can give (unexpectedly) accurate results for certain dynamics on disassortative real-world networks even when the mean degree is as low as 4.',

	{'abstract': u'We study a complementarity game as a systematic tool for the investigation of the interplay between individual optimization and population effects and for the comparison of different strategy and learning schemes. The game randomly pairs players from opposite populations. The game is symmetric at the individual level, but has many equilibria that are more or less favorable to the members of the two populations. Which of these equilibria then is attained is decided by the dynamics at the population level. Players play repeatedly, but in each round with a new opponent. They can learn from their previous encounters and translate this into their actions in the present round on the basis of strategic schemes. The schemes can be quite simple, or very elaborate. We can then break the symmetry in the game and give the members of the two populations access to different strategy spaces. Typically, simpler strategy types have an advantage because they tend to go more quickly towards a favorable equilibrium which, once reached, the other population is forced to accept. Also, populations with bolder individuals that may not fare so well at the level of individual performance may obtain an advantage towards ones with more timid players. By checking the effects of parameters such as the generation length or the mutation rate, we are able to compare the relative contributions of individual learning and evolutionary adaptations.',

	{'abstract': u"We study a complementarity game with multiple populations whose members' offered contributions are put together towards some common aim. When the sum of the players' offers reaches or exceeds some threshold K, they each receive K minus their own offers. Else, they all receive nothing. Each player tries to offer as little as possible, hoping that the sum of the contributions still reaches K, however. The game is symmetric at the individual level, but has many equilibria that are more or less favorable to the members of certain populations. In particular, it is possible that the members of one or several populations do not contribute anything, a behavior called defecting, while the others still contribute enough to reach the threshold. Which of these equilibria then is attained is decided by the dynamics at the population level that in turn depends on the strategic options the players possess. We find that defecting occurs when more than 3 populations participate in the game, even when the strategy scheme employed is very simple, if certain conditions for the system parameters are satisfied. The results are obtained through systematic simulations.",

	{'abstract': u'We draw a certain analogy between the classical information-theoretic problem of lossy data compression (source coding) of memoryless information sources and the statistical mechanical behavior of a certain model of a chain of connected particles (e.g., a polymer) that is subjected to a contracting force. The free energy difference pertaining to such a contraction turns out to be proportional to the rate-distortion function in the analogous data compression model, and the contracting force is proportional to the derivative this function. Beyond the fact that this analogy may be interesting on its own right, it may provide a physical perspective on the behavior of optimum schemes for lossy data compression (and perhaps also, an information-theoretic perspective on certain physical system models). Moreover, it triggers the derivation of lossy compression performance for systems with memory, using analysis tools and insights from statistical mechanics.',

	{'abstract': u'Inference and learning of graphical models are both well-studied problems in statistics and machine learning that have found many applications in science and engineering. However, exact inference is intractable in general graphical models, which suggests the problem of seeking the best approximation to a collection of random variables within some tractable family of graphical models. In this paper, we focus our attention on the class of planar Ising models, for which inference is tractable using techniques of statistical physics [Kac and Ward; Kasteleyn]. Based on these techniques and recent methods for planarity testing and planar embedding [Chrobak and Payne], we propose a simple greedy algorithm for learning the best planar Ising model to approximate an arbitrary collection of binary random variables (possibly from sample data). Given the set of all pairwise correlations among variables, we select a planar graph and optimal planar Ising model defined on this graph to best approximate that set of correlations. We demonstrate our method in some simulations and for the application of modeling senate voting records.',

It is a long standing open problem, whether or not the ideals of any poset can be generated in constant amortized time, CAT for short. We refine the tree traversal, a method introduced by Pruesse and Ruskey in 1993, to obtain a CAT-generator for two large classes of posets: posets of interval dimension at most two and so called locally planar posets. This includes all posets for which a CAT-generator was known before. Posets of interval dimension at most two generalize both, interval orders and 2-dimensional posets. Locally planar posets generalize for example posets with a planar cover graph. We apply our results to CAT-generate all c-orientations of a planar graph. As a special case this is a CAT-generator for many combinatorial objects like domino and lozenge tilings, planar spanning trees, planar bipartite perfect matchings, Schnyder woods, and others.',

From these new bounds it follows that for q &lt;= 2593 and q=2693,2753, the relation t_(2,q) &lt; 4.5 sqrt holds. Also, for q &lt;= 4561 we have t_(2,q) &lt; 4.75 sqrt. It is showed that for 23 &lt;= q &lt;= 4561 and q in T2 cup ,2^,2^, the inequality t_(2,q) &lt; sqrtln^q is true. Moreover, the results obtained allow us to conjecture that this estimate holds for all q &gt;= 23. The new upper bounds are obtained by finding new small complete arcs with the help of a computer search using randomized greedy algorithms. Also new constructions of complete arcs are proposed. These constructions form families of k-arcs in PG(2,q) containing arcs of all sizes k in a region k_ &lt;= k &lt;= k_ where k_ is of order q/3 or q/4 while k_ has order q/2. The completeness of the arcs obtained by the new constructions is proved for q &lt;= 1367 and 2003 &lt;= q &lt;= 2063. There is reason to suppose that the arcs are complete for all q &gt; 1367.

In this work we investigate the performance of quark solver using the restricted additive Schwarz (RAS) preconditioner on a low cost GPU cluster. We expect that the RAS preconditioner with appropriate domaindecomposition and task distribution reduces the communication bottleneck. The GPU cluster we constructed is composed of four PC boxes, two GPU cards are attached to each box, and we have eight GPU cards in total. The compute nodes are connected with rather slow but low cost Gigabit-Ethernet. We include the RAS preconditioner in the single-precision part of the mixedprecision nested-BiCGStab algorithm and the single-precision task is distributed to the multiple GPUs. The benchmarking is done with the O(a)-improved Wilson quark on a randomly generated gauge configuration with the size of . We observe a factor two improvment on the solver performance with the RAS precoditioner compared to that without the preconditioner and find that the improvment mainly comes from the reduction of the communication bottleneck as we expected.',

	{'abstract': u'An important step in unveiling the relation between network structure and dynamics defined on networks is to detect communities, and numerous methods have been developed separately to identify community structure in different classes of networks, such as unipartite networks, bipartite networks, and directed networks. We show that both unipartite and directed networks can be represented as bipartite networks, and their modularity is completely consistent with that for bipartite networks, the detection of modular structure on which can be reformulated as modularity maximization. To optimize the bipartite modularity, we develop a modified adaptive genetic algorithm (MAGA), which is shown to be especially efficient for community structure detection. The high efficiency of the MAGA is based on the following three improvements we make. First, we introduce a different measure for the informativeness of a locus instead of the standard deviation, which can exactly determine which loci mutate. This measure is the bias between the distribution of a locus over the current population and the uniform distribution of the locus, i.e., the Kullback-Leibler divergence between them. Second, we develop a reassignment technique for differentiating the informative state a locus has attained from the random state in the initial phase. Third, we present a modified mutation rule which by incorporating related operation can guarantee the convergence of the MAGA to the global optimum and can speed up the convergence process. Experimental results show that the MAGA outperforms existing methods in terms of modularity for both bipartite and unipartite networks.',

	{'abstract': u'We give new evidence that quantum computers -- moreover, rudimentary quantum computers built entirely out of linear-optical elements -- cannot be efficiently simulated by classical computers. In particular, we define a model of computation in which identical photons are generated, sent through a linear-optical network, then nonadaptively measured to count the number of photons in each mode. This model is not known or believed to be universal for quantum computation, and indeed, we discuss the prospects for realizing the model using current technology. On the other hand, we prove that the model is able to solve sampling problems and search problems that are classically intractable under plausible assumptions. Our first result says that, if there exists a polynomial-time classical algorithm that samples from the same probability distribution as a linear-optical network, then P^#P=BPP^NP, and hence the polynomial hierarchy collapses to the third level. Unfortunately, this result assumes an extremely accurate simulation. Our main result suggests that even an approximate or noisy classical simulation would already imply a collapse of the polynomial hierarchy. For this, we need two unproven conjectures: the "Permanent-of-Gaussians Conjecture", which says that it is #P-hard to approximate the permanent of a matrix A of independent N(0,1) Gaussian entries, with high probability over A; and the "Permanent Anti-Concentration Conjecture", which says that |Per(A)|&gt;=sqrt(n!)/poly(n) with high probability over A. We present evidence for these conjectures, both of which seem interesting even apart from our application. This paper does not assume knowledge of quantum optics. Indeed, part of its goal is to develop the beautiful theory of noninteracting bosons underlying our model, and its connection to the permanent function, in a self-contained way accessible to theoretical computer scientists.',

	{'abstract': u'The development of discursive knowledge presumes the communication of meaning as analytically different from the communication of information. Knowledge can then be considered as a meaning which makes a difference. Whereas the communication of information is studied in the information sciences and scientometrics, the communication of meaning has been central to Luhmann\'s attempts to make the theory of autopoiesis relevant for sociology. Analytical techniques such as semantic maps and the simulation of anticipatory systems enable us to operationalize the distinctions which Luhmann proposed as relevant to the elaboration of Husserl\'s "horizons of meaning" in empirical research: interactions among communications, the organization of meaning in instantiations, and the self-organization of interhuman communication in terms of symbolically generalized media such as truth, love, and power. Horizons of meaning, however, remain uncertain orders of expectations, and one should caution against reification from the meta-biological perspective of systems theory.',

Our framework simultaneously captures such well-known notions as internal and general Phi-regret, learning with non-additive global cost functions, Blackwell's approachability, calibration of forecasters, adaptive regret, and more. We show that learnability in all these situations is due to control of the same three quantities: a martingale convergence term, a term describing the ability to perform well if future is known, and a generalization of sequential Rademacher complexity, studied in (Rakhlin, Sridharan, Tewari, 2010).

	{'abstract': u'Algorithms have two costs: arithmetic and communication. The latter represents the cost of moving data, either between levels of a memory hierarchy, or between processors over a network. Communication often dominates arithmetic and represents a rapidly increasing proportion of the total cost, so we seek algorithms that minimize communication. In cite lower bounds were presented on the amount of communication required for essentially all -like algorithms for linear algebra, including eigenvalue problems and the SVD. Conventional algorithms, including those currently implemented in (Sca)LAPACK, perform asymptotically more communication than these lower bounds require. In this paper we present parallel and sequential eigenvalue algorithms (for pencils, nonsymmetric matrices, and symmetric matrices) and SVD algorithms that do attain these lower bounds, and analyze their convergence and communication costs.',

	{'abstract': u'In this paper we study the generalized version of weighted matching in bipartite networks. Consider a weighted matching in a bipartite network in which the nodes derive value from the split of the matching edge assigned to them if they are matched. The value a node derives from the split depends both on the split as well as the partner the node is matched to. We assume that the value of a split to the node is continuous and strictly increasing in the part of the split assigned to the node. A stable weighted matching is a matching and splits on the edges in the matching such that no two adjacent nodes in the network can split the edge between them so that both of them can derive a higher value than in the matching. We extend the weighted matching problem to this general case and study the existence of a stable weighted matching. We also present an algorithm that converges to a stable weighted matching. The algorithm generalizes the Hungarian algorithm for bipartite matching. Faster algorithms can be made when there is more structure on the value functions.',

Probabilities as small as 10^-180 are accessed using an artificial finite-temperature (Boltzmann) ensemble. The distributions for the Erdoes-Renyi ensemble agree well with previously obtained analytical results. The results for the percolation problem, where no analytical results are available, are qualitatively similar, but the shapes of the distributions are somehow different and the finite-size corrections are sometimes much larger. Furthermore, for both problems, a first-order phase transition at low temperatures T within the artificial ensemble is found in the percolating regime, respectively.',

The model is a linear system affected by a disturbance term: this represents a large class of technological faulty processes. The goal is to make the system able to tolerate the undesired perturbation, i.e., to remove or at least reduce its negative effects; such a task is performed in three steps: the detection of the fault, its identification and the consequent process recovery. When the disturbance function is known to be emph over a finite number of levels, the detection can be successfully executed by a recursive emph algorithm, arising from Information and Coding Theory and suitably adapted to the control framework. This technique is analyzed and tested in a flight control issue; both theoretical considerations and simulations are reported.',

	{'abstract': u'Describing the collective activity of neural populations is a daunting task: the number of possible patterns grows exponentially with the number of cells, resulting in practically unlimited complexity. Recent empirical studies, however, suggest a vast simplification in how multi-neuron spiking occurs: the activity patterns of some circuits are nearly completely captured by pairwise interactions among neurons. Why are such pairwise models so successful in some instances, but insufficient in others? Here, we study the emergence of higher-order interactions in simple circuits with different architectures and inputs. We quantify the impact of higher-order interactions by comparing the responses of mechanistic circuit models vs. "null" descriptions in which all higher-than-pairwise correlations have been accounted for by lower order statistics, known as pairwise maximum entropy models. We find that bimodal input signals produce larger deviations from pairwise predictions than unimodal inputs for circuits with local and global connectivity. Moreover, recurrent coupling can accentuate these deviations, if coupling strengths are neither too weak nor too strong. A circuit model based on intracellular recordings from ON parasol retinal ganglion cells shows that a broad range of light signals induce unimodal inputs to spike generators, and that coupling strengths produce weak effects on higher-order interactions. This provides a novel explanation for the success of pairwise models in this system. Overall, our findings identify circuit-level mechanisms that produce and fail to produce higher-order spiking statistics in neural ensembles.',

	{'abstract': u'This paper presents an efficient parallel approximation scheme for a new class of min-max problems. The algorithm is derived from the matrix multiplicative weights update method and can be used to find near-optimal strategies for competitive two-party classical or quantum interactions in which a referee exchanges any number of messages with one party followed by any number of additional messages with the other. It considerably extends the class of interactions which admit parallel solutions, demonstrating for the first time the existence of a parallel algorithm for an interaction in which one party reacts adaptively to the other. As a consequence, we prove that several competing-provers complexity classes collapse to PSPACE such as QRG(2), SQG and two new classes called DIP and DQIP. A special case of our result is a parallel approximation scheme for a specific class of semidefinite programs whose feasible region consists of lists of semidefinite matrices that satisfy a transcript-like consistency condition. Applied to this special case, our algorithm yields a direct polynomial-space simulation of multi-message quantum interactive proofs resulting in a first-principles proof of QIP=PSPACE.',

	{'abstract': u'Contact processes describe the transmission of distinct properties of nodes via the links of a network. They provide a simple framework for many phenomena, such as epidemic spreading and opinion formation. Combining contact processes with rules for topological evolution yields an adaptive network in which the states of the nodes can interact dynamically with the topological degrees of freedom. By moment-closure approximation it is possible to derive low-dimensional systems of ordinary differential equations that describe the dynamics of the adaptive network on a coarse-grained level. In this chapter we discuss the approximation technique itself as well as its applications to adaptive networks. Thus, it can serve both as a tutorial as well as a review of recent results.',

	{'abstract': u'Complex sequencing rules observed in birdsongs provide an opportunity to investigate the neural mechanism for generating complex sequential behaviors. To relate the findings from studying birdsongs to other sequential behaviors, it is crucial to characterize the statistical properties of the sequencing rules in birdsongs. However, the properties of the sequencing rules in birdsongs have not yet been fully addressed. In this study, we investigate the statistical propertiesof the complex birdsong of the Bengalese finch (Lonchura striata var. domestica). Based on manual-annotated syllable sequences, we first show that there are significant higher-order context dependencies in Bengalese finch songs, that is, which syllable appears next depends on more than one previous syllable. This property is shared with other complex sequential behaviors. We then analyze acoustic features of the song and show that higher-order context dependencies can be explained using first-order hidden state transition dynamics with redundant hidden states. This model corresponds to hidden Markov models (HMMs), well known statistical models with a large range of application for time series modeling. The song annotation with these models with first-order hidden state dynamics agreed well with manual annotation, the score was comparable to that of a second-order HMM, and surpassed the zeroth-order model (the Gaussian mixture model (GMM)), which does not use context information. Our results imply that the hierarchical representation with hidden state dynamics may underlie the neural implementation for generating complex sequences with higher-order dependencies.',

	{'abstract': u'We study a general class of PageRank optimization problems which consist in finding an optimal outlink strategy for a web site subject to design constraints. We consider both a continuous problem, in which one can choose the intensity of a link, and a discrete one, in which in each page, there are obligatory links, facultative links and forbidden links. We show that the continuous problem, as well as its discrete variant when there are no constraints coupling different pages, can both be modeled by constrained Markov decision processes with ergodic reward, in which the webmaster determines the transition probabilities of websurfers. Although the number of actions turns out to be exponential, we show that an associated polytope of transition measures has a concise representation, from which we deduce that the continuous problem is solvable in polynomial time, and that the same is true for the discrete problem when there are no coupling constraints. We also provide efficient algorithms, adapted to very large networks. Then, we investigate the qualitative features of optimal outlink strategies, and identify in particular assumptions under which there exists a "master" page to which all controlled pages should point. We report numerical results on fragments of the real web graph.',

	{'abstract': u'We transpose an optimal control technique to the image segmentation problem. The idea is to consider image segmentation as a parameter estimation problem. The parameter to estimate is the color of the pixels of the image. We use the adaptive parameterization technique which builds iteratively an optimal representation of the parameter into uniform regions that form a partition of the domain, hence corresponding to a segmentation of the image. We minimize an error function during the iterations, and the partition of the image into regions is optimally driven by the gradient of this error. The resulting segmentation algorithm inherits desirable properties from its optimal control origin: soundness, robustness, and flexibility.',

	{'abstract': u'As research into community finding in social networks progresses, there is a need for algorithms capable of detecting overlapping community structure. Many algorithms have been proposed in recent years that are capable of assigning each node to more than a single community. The performance of these algorithms tends to degrade when the ground-truth contains a more highly overlapping community structure, with nodes assigned to more than two communities. Such highly overlapping structure is likely to exist in many social networks, such as Facebook friendship networks. In this paper we present a scalable algorithm, MOSES, based on a statistical model of community structure, which is capable of detecting highly overlapping community structure, especially when there is variance in the number of communities each node is in. In evaluation on synthetic data MOSES is found to be superior to existing algorithms, especially at high levels of overlap. We demonstrate MOSES on real social network data by analyzing the networks of friendship links between students of five US universities.',

	{'abstract': u'We consider the problem of digital halftoning from the view point of statistical mechanics. The digital halftoning is a sort of image processing, namely, representing each grayscale in terms of black and white binary dots. The digital halftoning is achieved by making use of the threshold mask, namely, for each pixel, the halftoned binary pixel is determined as black if the original grayscale pixel is greater than or equal to the mask value and is determined as white vice versa. To determine the optimal value of the mask on each pixel for a given original grayscale image, we first assume that the human-eyes might recognize the black and white binary halftoned image as the corresponding grayscale one by linear filters. The Hamiltonian is constructed as a distance between the original and the recognized images which is written in terms of the threshold mask. We are confirmed that the system described by the Hamiltonian is regarded as a kind of antiferromagnetic Ising model with quenched disorders. By searching the ground state of the Hamiltonian, we obtain the optimal threshold mask and the resulting halftoned binary dots simultaneously. From the power-spectrum analysis, we find that the binary dots image is physiologically plausible from the view point of human-eyes modulation properties. We also propose a theoretical framework to investigate statistical performance of inverse digital halftoning, that is, the inverse process of halftoning. From the Bayesian inference view point, we rigorously show that the Bayes-optimal inverse-halftoning is achieved on a specific condition which is very similar to the so-called Nishimori line in the research field of spin glasses.',

	{'abstract': u"The electrical power network is a critical infrastructure in today's society, so its safe and reliable operation is of major concern. State estimators are commonly used in power networks, for example, to detect faulty equipment and to optimally route power flows. The estimators are often located in control centers, to which large numbers of measurements are sent over unencrypted communication channels. Therefore cyber security for state estimators becomes an important issue. In this paper we analyze the cyber security of state estimators in supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) for energy management systems (EMS) operating the power network. Current EMS state estimation algorithms have bad data detection (BDD) schemes to detect outliers in the measurement data. Such schemes are based on high measurement redundancy. Although these methods may detect a set of basic cyber attacks, they may fail in the presence of an intelligent attacker. We explore the latter by considering scenarios where stealthy deception attacks are performed by sending false information to the control center. We begin by presenting a recent framework that characterizes the attack as an optimization problem with the objective specified through a security metric and constraints corresponding to the attack cost. The framework is used to conduct realistic experiments on a state-of-the-art SCADA EMS software for a power network example with 14 substations, 27 buses, and 40 branches. The results indicate how state estimators for power networks can be made more resilient to cyber security attacks.",

	{'abstract': u'Grothendieck inequalities are fundamental inequalities which are frequently used in many areas of mathematics and computer science. They can be interpreted as upper bounds for the integrality gap between two optimization problems: a difficult semidefinite program with rank-1 constraint and its easy semidefinite relaxation where the rank constrained is dropped. For instance, the integrality gap of the Goemans-Williamson approximation algorithm for MAX CUT can be seen as a Grothendieck inequality. In this paper we consider Grothendieck inequalities for ranks greater than 1 and we give two applications: approximating ground states in the n-vector model in statistical mechanics and XOR games in quantum information theory.',

	{'abstract': u'Network data often take the form of repeated interactions between senders and receivers tabulated over time. A primary question to ask of such data is which traits and behaviors are predictive of interaction. To answer this question, a model is introduced for treating directed interactions as a multivariate point process: a Cox multiplicative intensity model using covariates that depend on the history of the process. Consistency and asymptotic normality are proved for the resulting partial-likelihood-based estimators under suitable regularity conditions, and an efficient fitting procedure is described. Multicast interactions--those involving a single sender but multiple receivers--are treated explicitly. The resulting inferential framework is then employed to model message sending behavior in a corporate e-mail network. The analysis gives a precise quantification of which static shared traits and dynamic network effects are predictive of message recipient selection.',

	{'abstract': u"This article concerns the computational problem of counting the lattice points inside convex polytopes, when each point must be counted with a weight associated to it. We describe an efficient algorithm for computing the highest degree coefficients of the weighted Ehrhart quasi-polynomial for a rational simple polytope in varying dimension, when the weights of the lattice points are given by a polynomial function h. Our technique is based on a refinement of an algorithm of A. Barvinok [Computing the Ehrhart quasi-polynomial of a rational simplex, Math. Comp. 75 (2006), pp. 1449--1466] in the unweighted case (i.e., h = 1). In contrast to Barvinok's method, our method is local, obtains an approximation on the level of generating functions, handles the general weighted case, and provides the coefficients in closed form as step polynomials of the dilation. To demonstrate the practicality of our approach we report on computational experiments which show even our simple implementation can compete with state of the art software.",

Logarithmic binning retrieves information and trends "not visible" in noisy power-law tails. We also argue that obtaining the exponent from logarithmically binned data using a simple least square method is in some cases warranted in addition to methods such as the maximum likelihood. We also show why often used cumulative distributions can make it difficult to distinguish noise from genuine features, and make it difficult to obtain an accurate power-law exponent of the underlying distribution. The treatment is non-technical, aimed at IS researchers with little or no background in mathematics.',

	{'abstract': u'Suppose a given observation matrix can be decomposed as the sum of a low-rank matrix and a sparse matrix (outliers), and the goal is to recover these individual components from the observed sum. Such additive decompositions have applications in a variety of numerical problems including system identification, latent variable graphical modeling, and principal components analysis. We study conditions under which recovering such a decomposition is possible via a combination of norm and trace norm minimization. We are specifically interested in the question of how many outliers are allowed so that convex programming can still achieve accurate recovery, and we obtain stronger recovery guarantees than previous studies. Moreover, we do not assume that the spatial pattern of outliers is random, which stands in contrast to related analyses under such assumptions via matrix completion.',

To establish this, we prove an adversary lower bound using a detailed analysis of the structure of minor-closed properties with respect to forbidden topological minors and forbidden subgraphs. On the other hand, we show that minor-closed properties (and more generally, sparse graph properties) that can be characterized by finitely many forbidden subgraphs can be solved strictly faster, in o(n^) queries.

	{'abstract': u"The Rock-Paper-Scissors(RPS) game is a paradigmatic model for cyclic dominance in biological systems. Here we consider this game in the social context of competition between opinions in a networked society. In our model, every agent has an opinion which is drawn from the three choices: rock, paper or scissors. In every timestep a link is selected randomly and the game is played between the nodes connected by the link. The loser either adopts the opinion of the winner or rewires the link. These rules define an adaptive network on which the agent's opinions coevolve with the network topology of social contacts. We show analytically and numerically that nonequilibrium phase transitions occur as a function of the rewiring strength. The transitions separate four distinct phases which differ in the observed dynamics of opinions and topology. In particular, there is one phase where the population settles to an arbitrary consensus opinion. We present a detailed analysis of the corresponding transitions revealing an apparently paradoxial behavior. The system approaches consensus states where they are unstable, whereas other dynamics prevail when the consensus states are stable.",

Here we study these games by extensive numerical simulation on networked social structures using an evolutionary approach. We show that local network effects may promote selection of efficient equilibria in both pure and general coordination games and may explain social polarization. These results are put into perspective with respect to known theoretical results. The main insight we obtain is that clustering, and especially community structure in social networks has a positive role in promoting socially efficient outcomes.',

	{'abstract': u'Spectral clustering is one of the most widely used techniques for extracting the underlying global structure of a data set. Compressed sensing and matrix completion have emerged as prevailing methods for efficiently recovering sparse and partially observed signals respectively. We combine the distance preserving measurements of compressed sensing and matrix completion with the power of robust spectral clustering. Our analysis provides rigorous bounds on how small errors in the affinity matrix can affect the spectral coordinates and clusterability. This work generalizes the current perturbation results of two-class spectral clustering to incorporate multi-class clustering with k eigenvectors. We thoroughly track how small perturbation from using compressed sensing and matrix completion affect the affinity matrix and in succession the spectral coordinates. These perturbation results for multi-class clustering require an eigengap between the kth and (k+1)th eigenvalues of the affinity matrix, which naturally occurs in data with k well-defined clusters. Our theoretical guarantees are complemented with numerical results along with a number of examples of the unsupervised organization and clustering of image data.',

	{'abstract': u'We resolve the question of optimality for a well-studied packetized implementation of random linear network coding, called PNC. In PNC, in contrast to the classical memoryless setting, nodes store received information in memory to later produce coded packets that reflect this information. PNC is known to achieve order optimal stopping times for the many-to-all multicast problem in many settings. We give a reduction that captures exactly how PNC and other network coding protocols use the memory of the nodes. More precisely, we show that any such protocol implementation induces a transformation which maps an execution of the protocol to an instance of the classical memoryless setting. This allows us to prove that, for any (non-adaptive dynamic) network, PNC converges with high probability in optimal time. In other words, it stops at exactly the first time in which in hindsight it was possible to route information from the sources to each receiver individually. Our technique also applies to variants of PNC, in which each node uses only a finite buffer. We show that, even in this setting, PNC stops exactly within the time in which in hindsight it was possible to route packets given the memory constraint, i.e., that the memory used at each node never exceeds its buffer size. This shows that PNC, even without any feedback or explicit memory management, allows to keep minimal buffer sizes while maintaining its capacity achieving performance.',

	{'abstract': u'Traditional spectral clustering methods cannot naturally learn the number of communities in a network and often fail to detect smaller community structure in dense networks because they are based upon external community connectivity properties such as graph cuts. We propose an algorithm for detecting community structure in networks called the leader-follower algorithm which is based upon the natural internal structure expected of communities in social networks. The algorithm uses the notion of network centrality in a novel manner to differentiate leaders (nodes which connect different communities) from loyal followers (nodes which only have neighbors within a single community). Using this approach, it is able to naturally learn the communities from the network structure and does not require the number of communities as an input, in contrast to other common methods such as spectral clustering. We prove that it will detect all of the communities exactly for any network possessing communities with the natural internal structure expected in social networks. More importantly, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the leader-follower algorithm in the context of various real networks ranging from social networks such as Facebook to biological networks such as an fMRI based human brain network. We find that the leader-follower algorithm finds the relevant community structure in these networks without knowing the number of communities beforehand. Also, because the leader-follower algorithm detects communities using their internal structure, we find that it can resolve a finer community structure in dense networks than common spectral clustering methods based on external community structure.',

	{'abstract': u"In this article we consider the inversion problem for polynomially computable discrete functions. These functions describe behavior of many discrete systems and are used in model checking, hardware verification, cryptanalysis, computer biology and other domains. Quite often it is necessary to invert these functions, i.e. to find an unknown preimage if an image and algorithm of function computation are given. In general case this problem is computationally intractable. However, many of it's special cases are very important in practical applications. Thus development of algorithms that are applicable to these special cases is of importance. The practical applicability of such algorithms can be validated by their ability to solve the problems that are considered to be computationally hard (for example cryptanalysis problems). In this article we propose the technology of solving the inversion problem for polynomially computable discrete functions. This technology was implemented in distributed computing environments (parallel clusters and Grid-systems). It is based on reducing the inversion problem for the considered function to some SAT problem. We describe a general approach to coarse-grained parallelization for obtained SAT problems. Efficiency of each parallelization scheme is determined by the means of a special predictive function. The proposed technology was validated by successful solving of cryptanalysis problems for some keystream generators. The main practical result of this work is a complete cryptanalysis of keystream generator A5/1 which was performed in a Grid system specially built for this task.",

We take into account the impact of these decisions on the behavior of intelligent mobile terminals who can connect to the base station that offers the best utility. The signal to interference and noise ratio is used as the quantity that determines the association. We first study the SINR association-game: we determine the cells corresponding to each base stations, i.e., the locations at which mobile terminals prefer to connect to a given base station than to others. We make some surprising observations: (i) displacing a base station a little in one direction may result in a displacement of the boundary of the corresponding cell to the opposite direction; (ii) A cell corresponding to a BS may be the union of disconnected sub-cells. We then study the hierarchical equilibrium in the combined BS location and mobile association problem: we determine where to locate the BSs so as to maximize the revenues obtained at the induced SINR mobile association game. We consider the cases of single frequency band and two frequency bands of operation. Finally, we also consider hierarchical equilibria in two frequency systems with successive interference cancellation.',

We map this problem to the propagation of multiple random walkers on directed networks and we evaluate the inter-arrival time distribution between successive walkers arriving at a target. We show that the temporal organization of this process, which models information propagation on unstructured peer to peer networks, has the same features as SPAM arriving to a single user. We study the behavior of the message inter-arrival time distribution on three different network topologies using two different rules for sending messages. In all networks the propagation is not a pure Poisson process. It shows universal features on Poissonian networks and a more complex behavior on scale free networks. Results open the possibility to indirectly learn about the process of sending messages on networks with unknown topologies, by studying inter-arrival times at any node of the network.',

	{'abstract': u'The paper introduces an original MAC protocol for a passive optical metropolitan area network using time-domain wavelength interleaved networking (TWIN)% as proposed recently by Bell Labs . Optical channels are shared under the distributed control of destinations using a packet-based polling algorithm. This MAC is inspired more by EPON dynamic bandwidth allocation than the slotted, GPON-like access control generally envisaged for TWIN. Management of source-destination traffic streams is flow-aware with the size of allocated time slices being proportional to the number of active flows. This emulates a network-wide, distributed fair queuing scheduler, bringing the well-known implicit service differentiation and robustness advantages of this mechanism to the metro area network. The paper presents a comprehensive performance evaluation based on analytical modelling supported by simulations. The proposed MAC is shown to have excellent performance in terms of both traffic capacity and packet latency.',

	{'abstract': u'The rainbow connection number, rc(G), of a connected graph G is the minimum number of colours needed to colour its edges, so that every pair of its vertices is connected by at least one path in which no two edges are coloured the same. In this note we show that for every bridgeless graph G with radius r, rc(G) &lt;= r(r + 2). We demonstrate that this bound is the best possible for rc(G) as a function of r, not just for bridgeless graphs, but also for graphs of any stronger connectivity. It may be noted that for a general 1-connected graph G, rc(G) can be arbitrarily larger than its radius (Star graph for instance). We further show that for every bridgeless graph G with radius r and chordality (size of a largest induced cycle) k, rc(G) &lt;= rk. It is known that computing rc(G) is NP-Hard [Chakraborty et al., 2009]. Here, we present a (r+3)-factor approximation algorithm which runs in O(nm) time and a (d+3)-factor approximation algorithm which runs in O(dm) time to rainbow colour any connected graph G on n vertices, with m edges, diameter d and radius r.',

	{'abstract': u"In a recent paper from SODA11 cite the authors introduced a general framework for exponential time improvement of minwise based algorithms by defining and constructing almost kmin independent family of hash functions. Here we take it a step forward and reduce the space and the independent needed for representing the functions, by defining and constructing a dkmin independent family of hash functions. Surprisingly, for most cases only 8-wise independent is needed for exponential time and space improvement. Moreover, we bypass the independent lower bound for approximately minwise functions cite, as we use alternative definition. In addition, as the independent's degree is a small constant it can be implemented efficiently. Informally, under this definition, all subsets of size of any fixed set have an equal probability to have hash values among the minimal values in , where the probability is over the random choice of hash function from the family. This property measures the randomness of the family, as choosing a truly random function, obviously, satisfies the definition for . We define and give an efficient time and space construction of approximately dkmin independent family of hash functions. The degree of independent required is optimal, i.e. only for , where is the desired error bound. This construction can be used to improve many minwise based algorithms, such as cite, as will be discussed here. To our knowledge such definitions, for hash functions, were never studied and no construction was given before.",

	{'abstract': u'This paper considers deployment problems where a mobile robotic network must optimize its configuration in a distributed way in order to minimize a steady-state cost function that depends on the spatial distribution of certain probabilistic events of interest. Moreover, it is assumed that the event location distribution is a priori unknown, and can only be progressively inferred from the observation of the actual event occurrences. Three classes of problems are discussed in detail: coverage control problems, spatial partitioning problems, and dynamic vehicle routing problems. In each case, distributed stochastic gradient algorithms optimizing the performance objective are presented. The stochastic gradient view simplifies and generalizes previously proposed solutions, and is applicable to new complex scenarios, such as adaptive coverage involving heterogeneous agents. Remarkably, these algorithms often take the form of simple distributed rules that could be implemented on resource-limited platforms.',

The experiment was performed using a measuring infrastructure RIPE test box, ensuring precision accuracy. The experimental results showed that to increase the accuracy of available bandwidth, we need to neutralize the effect of the variable part of the delay by increasing the number of measurements. Finally, we made the computer simulation, which allowed us to establish a dependence between the measurement error of the available bandwidth and the number of measurements.',

CERTPLC can handle PLC descriptions provided in the Sequential Function Chart (SFC) language of the IEC 61131-3 standard. It provides routines to certify properties of systems by delivering an independently checkable formal system description and proof (called certificate) for the desired properties. We focus on properties that can be described as inductive invariants. System descriptions and certificates are generated and handled using the COQ proof assistant. Our tool framework is used to provide supporting evidence for the safety of embedded systems in the industrial automation domain to third-party authorities. In this document we describe the tool framework: usage scenarios, the archi-tecture, semantics of PLCs and their realization in COQ, proof generation and the construction of certificates.',

	{'abstract': u'One of the key challenges in sensor networks is the extraction of information by fusing data from a multitude of distinct, but possibly unreliable sensors. Recovering information from the maximum number of dependable sensors while specifying the unreliable ones is critical for robust sensing. This sensing task is formulated here as that of finding the maximum number of feasible subsystems of linear equations, and proved to be NP-hard. Useful links are established with compressive sampling, which aims at recovering vectors that are sparse. In contrast, the signals here are not sparse, but give rise to sparse residuals. Capitalizing on this form of sparsity, four sensing schemes with complementary strengths are developed. The first scheme is a convex relaxation of the original problem expressed as a second-order cone program (SOCP). It is shown that when the involved sensing matrices are Gaussian and the reliable measurements are sufficiently many, the SOCP can recover the optimal solution with overwhelming probability. The second scheme is obtained by replacing the initial objective function with a concave one. The third and fourth schemes are tailored for noisy sensor data. The noisy case is cast as a combinatorial problem that is subsequently surrogated by a (weighted) SOCP. Interestingly, the derived cost functions fall into the framework of robust multivariate linear regression, while an efficient block-coordinate descent algorithm is developed for their minimization. The robust sensing capabilities of all schemes are verified by simulated tests.',

When the finite field size is larger than or equal to the number of users, it is shown that we can always find an encoding vector which is both innovative and sparse. The sparsity can be utilized in speeding up the decoding process. An efficient algorithm to generate innovative and sparse encoding vectors is developed. Simulations show that the delay performance of our scheme with binary finite field outperforms a number of existing schemes in terms of average and worst-case delay.',

	{'abstract': u'We consider rate R = k/n causal linear codes that map a sequence of k-dimensional binary vectors to a sequence of n-dimensional binary vectors , such that each c_t is a function of . Such a code is called anytime reliable, for a particular binary-input memoryless channel, if at each time, probability of making an error about a source bit that was sent d time instants ago decays exponentially in d. Anytime reliable codes are useful in interactive communication problems and, in particular, can be used to stabilize unstable plants across noisy channels. Schulman proved the existence of such codes which, due to their structure, he called tree codes; however, to date, no explicit constructions and tractable decoding algorithms have been devised. In this paper, we show the existence of anytime reliable "linear" codes with "high probability", i.e., suitably chosen random linear causal codes are anytime reliable with high probability. The key is to consider time-invariant codes (i.e., ones with Toeplitz generator and parity check matrices) which obviates the need to union bound over all times. For the binary erasure channel we give a simple ML decoding algorithm whose average complexity is constant per time iteration and for which the probability that complexity at a given time t exceeds KC^3 decays exponentially in C. We show the efficacy of the method by simulating the stabilization of an unstable plant across a BEC, and remark on the tradeoffs between the utilization of the communication resources and the control performance.',

We numerically examine genetic algorithms (GAs) to determine the optimal set of parameters such as the weights for three essential interactions in BOIDS by Reynolds (1987) under `zero-collision' and `no-breaking-up' constraints. As a fitness function (the energy function) to be maximized by the GA, we choose the so-called the -value of anisotropy which can be observed empirically in typical flocks of starling. We confirm that the GA successfully finds the solution having a large -value leading-up to a strong anisotropy. The numerical experience shows that the procedure might enable us to make more realistic and efficient artificial flocking of starling even in our personal computers. We also evaluate two distinct types of interactions in agents, namely, metric and topological definitions of interactions. We confirmed that the topological definition can explain the empirical evidence much better than the metric definition does.",

	{'abstract': u'In this work, we investigate a model of an adaptive networked dynamical system, where the coupling strengths among phase oscillators coevolve with the phase states. It is shown that in this model the oscillators can spontaneously differentiate into two dynamical groups after a long time evolution. Within each group, the oscillators have similar phases, while oscillators in different groups have approximately opposite phases. The network gradually converts from the initial random structure with a uniform distribution of connection strengths into a modular structure which is characterized by strong intra connections and weak inter connections. Furthermore, the connection strengths follow a power law distribution, which is a natural consequence of the coevolution of the network and the dynamics. Interestingly, it is found that if the inter connections are weaker than a certain threshold, the two dynamical groups will almost decouple and evolve independently. These results are helpful in further understanding the empirical observations in many social and biological networks.',

	{'abstract': u"We study the problem of multiple hypothesis testing (HT) in view of a rejection option. That model of HT has many different applications. Errors in testing of M hypotheses regarding the source distribution with an option of rejecting all those hypotheses are considered. The source is discrete and arbitrarily varying (AVS). The tradeoffs among error probability exponents/reliabilities associated with false acceptance of rejection decision and false rejection of true distribution are investigated and the optimal decision strategies are outlined. The main result is specialized for discrete memoryless sources (DMS) and studied further. An interesting insight that the analysis implies is the phenomenon (comprehensible in terms of supervised/unsupervised learning) that in optimal discrimination within M hypothetical distributions one permits always lower error than in deciding to decline the set of hypotheses. Geometric interpretations of the optimal decision schemes are given for the current and known bounds in multi-HT for AVS's.",

	{'abstract': u'In the present paper, a modification of the Index-less Indexed Flash Codes (ILIFC) for flash memory storage system is presented. Although the ILIFC proposed by Mahdavifar et al. has excellent worst case performance, the ILIFC can be further improved in terms of the average case performance. The proposed scheme, referred to as the , is based on the ILIFC. However, the primary focus of the present study is the average case performance. The main feature of the proposed scheme is the use of the layer-based index coding to represent indices of information bits. The layer index coding promotes the uniform use of cell levels, which leads to better average case performance. Based on experiments, the proposed scheme achieves a larger average number of rewritings than the original ILIFC without loss of worst case performance.',

	{'abstract': u"Intra-session network coding is known to be vulnerable to pollution attacks. In this work, first, we introduce a novel homomorphic MAC scheme called SpaceMac, which allows an intermediate node to verify if its received packets belong to a specific subspace, even if the subspace is expanding over time. Then, we use SpaceMac as a building block to design a cooperative scheme that provides complete defense against pollution attacks: (i) it can detect polluted packets early at intermediate nodes and (ii) it can identify the exact location of all, even colluding, attackers, thus making it possible to eliminate them. Our scheme is cooperative: parents and children of any node cooperate to detect any corrupted packets sent by the node, and nodes in the network cooperate with a central controller to identify the exact location of all attackers. We implement SpaceMac in both C/C++ and Java as a library, and we make the library available online. Our evaluation on both a PC and an Android device shows that (i) SpaceMac's algorithms can be computed quickly and efficiently, and (ii) our cooperative defense scheme has low computation and significantly lower communication overhead than other comparable state-of-the-art schemes.",

	{'abstract': u'We deterministically crack the secure, statistical key exchange protocol based on feedback proposed by Pao-Lo Liu [ J. Lightwave Techology 27 (2009) pp. 5230-34]. The crack is ultimate and absolute because it works under idealized conditions, and produces much higher data visibility for the eavesdropper than the protocol provides for Alice and Bob. Even with the most idealistic driving noise spectrum stated by Liu, during the most secure phase of the protocol, far away from the transients, where the system is already in its most secure steady-state, the eavesdropper has 100% success rate in identifying the key bits, at the same time when Alice and Bob have less than 100% success rate while using the Liu protocol. No statistics is needed, Eve can extract the secure bit from two samples of the signal in the two direction. Thus the Liu-protocol offers no security against the attack described in this paper.',

	{'abstract': u'Hairpin completion and its variant called bounded hairpin completion are operations on formal languages, inspired by a hairpin formation in molecular biology. Another variant called hairpin lengthening has been recently introduced and studied on the closure properties and algorithmic problems concerning several families of languages. In this paper, we introduce a new operation of this kind, called hairpin incompletion which is not only an extension of bounded hairpin completion, but also a restricted (bounded) variant of hairpin lengthening. Further, the hairpin incompletion operation provides a formal language theoretic framework that models a bio-molecular technique nowadays known as Whiplash PCR. We study the closure properties of language families under both the operation and its iterated version. We show that a family of languages closed under intersection with regular sets, concatenation with regular sets, and finite union is closed under one-sided iterated hairpin incompletion, and that a family of languages containing all linear languages and closed under circular permutation, left derivative and substitution is also closed under iterated hairpin incompletion.',

	{'abstract': u'A simple four node network in which cooperation improves the information-theoretic secrecy is studied. The channel consists of two senders, a receiver, and an eavesdropper. One or both senders transmit confidential messages to the receiver, while the eavesdropper tries to decode the transmitted message. The main result is the derivation of a newly achievable rate-equivocation region that is shown to be larger than a rate-equivocation region derived by Lai and El Gamal for the relay-eavesdropper channel. When the rate of the helping interferer is zero, the new rate-equivocation region reduces to the capacity-equivocation region over the wire-tap channel, hence, the new achievability scheme can be seen as a generalization of a coding scheme proposed by Csiszar and Korner. This result can naturally be combined with a rate-equivocation region given by Tang et al. (for the interference assisted secret communication), yielding an even larger achievable rate-equivocation region.',

The use of the Unified Modeling Language (UML) as a model description language is also rapidly becoming a standard. All these concepts have relations to the HLA, but they are not part of it. There seems to be the danger that HLA is overrun by respective developments of the free market and will become irrelevant finally. ...

	{'abstract': u'In order to group the functional requirements for support to operations by modern information systems systematically, the NATO Code of best Practise (COBP) for C2 Assessment defines three domain areas: Battlespace Visualization, Decision Making, and Battle Management Functions. In addition, within an domain overlapping information grid of the information system, necessary functions for assessing and disseminating the information are capsulated. For all three domains, including the overlapping information grid, the respective requirements for functional support have to be met be future command, control, communications, and intelligence (C3I) systems. The paper describes the functional categories of the three domains having been defined for article 5 operations, extends them to meet the requirements for operations other than war (OOTW), and gives some examples how modules of simulation systems can deliver respective support functions. In addition, references defining migration procedures for legacy systems to enable a smooth change from the old to the new C3I paradigm are given.',

	{'abstract': u'This paper introduces a new method for learning and inferring sparse representations of depth (disparity) maps. The proposed algorithm relaxes the usual assumption of the stationary noise model in sparse coding. This enables learning from data corrupted with spatially varying noise or uncertainty, typically obtained by laser range scanners or structured light depth cameras. Sparse representations are learned from the Middlebury database disparity maps and then exploited in a two-layer graphical model for inferring depth from stereo, by including a sparsity prior on the learned features. Since they capture higher-order dependencies in the depth structure, these priors can complement smoothness priors commonly used in depth inference based on Markov Random Field (MRF) models. Inference on the proposed graph is achieved using an alternating iterative optimization technique, where the first layer is solved using an existing MRF-based stereo matching algorithm, then held fixed as the second layer is solved using the proposed non-stationary sparse coding algorithm. This leads to a general method for improving solutions of state of the art MRF-based depth estimation algorithms. Our experimental results first show that depth inference using learned representations leads to state of the art denoising of depth maps obtained from laser range scanners and a time of flight camera. Furthermore, we show that adding sparse priors improves the results of two depth estimation methods: the classical graph cut algorithm by Boykov et al. and the more recent algorithm of Woodford et al.',

	{'abstract': u'In distributed storage systems built using commodity hardware, it is necessary to have data redundancy in order to ensure system reliability. In such systems, it is also often desirable to be able to quickly repair storage nodes that fail. We consider a scheme--introduced by El Rouayheb and Ramchandran--which uses combinatorial block design in order to design storage systems that enable efficient (and exact) node repair. In this work, we investigate systems where node sizes may be much larger than replication degrees, and explicitly provide algorithms for constructing these storage designs. Our designs, which are related to projective geometries, are based on the construction of bipartite cage graphs (with girth 6) and the concept of mutually-orthogonal Latin squares. Via these constructions, we can guarantee that the resulting designs require the fewest number of storage nodes for the given parameters, and can further show that these systems can be easily expanded without need for frequent reconfiguration.',

	{'abstract': u'It has been recently shown by Lapidoth and Steinberg that strictly causal state information can be beneficial in multiple access channels (MACs). Specifically, it was proved that the capacity region of a two-user MAC with independent states, each known strictly causally to one encoder, can be enlarged by letting the encoders send compressed past state information to the decoder. In this work, a generalization of the said strategy is proposed whereby the encoders compress also the past transmitted codewords along with the past state sequences. The proposed scheme uses a combination of long-message encoding, compression of the past state sequences and codewords without binning, and joint decoding over all transmission blocks. The proposed strategy has been recently shown by Lapidoth and Steinberg to strictly improve upon the original one. Capacity results are then derived for a class of channels that include two-user modulo-additive state-dependent MACs. Moreover, the proposed scheme is extended to state-dependent MACs with an arbitrary number of users. Finally, output feedback is introduced and an example is provided to illustrate the interplay between feedback and availability of strictly causal state information in enlarging the capacity region.',

	{'abstract': u'Aggregation is an important building block of modern distributed applications, allowing the determination of meaningful properties (e.g. network size, total storage capacity, average load, majorities, etc.) that are used to direct the execution of the system. However, the majority of the existing aggregation algorithms exhibit relevant dependability issues, when prospecting their use in real application environments. In this paper, we reveal some dependability issues of aggregation algorithms based on iterative averaging techniques, giving some directions to solve them. This class of algorithms is considered robust (when compared to common tree-based approaches), being independent from the used routing topology and providing an aggregation result at all nodes. However, their robustness is strongly challenged and their correctness often compromised, when changing the assumptions of their working environment to more realistic ones. The correctness of this class of algorithms relies on the maintenance of a fundamental invariant, commonly designated as "mass conservation". We will argue that this main invariant is often broken in practical settings, and that additional mechanisms and modifications are required to maintain it, incurring in some degradation of the algorithms performance. In particular, we discuss the behavior of three representative algorithms Push-Sum Protocol, Push-Pull Gossip protocol and Distributed Random Grouping under asynchronous and faulty (with message loss and node crashes) environments. More specifically, we propose and evaluate two new versions of the Push-Pull Gossip protocol, which solve its message interleaving problem (evidenced even in a synchronous operation mode).',

	{'abstract': u'Evolutionary dynamics have been traditionally studied in the context of homogeneous populations, mainly described my the Moran process. Recently, this approach has been generalized in cite by arranging individuals on the nodes of a network. Undirected networks seem to have a smoother behavior than directed ones, and thus it is more challenging to find suppressors/amplifiers of selection. In this paper we present the first class of undirected graphs which act as suppressors of selection, by achieving a fixation probability that is at most one half of that of the complete graph, as the number of vertices increases. Moreover, we provide some generic upper and lower bounds for the fixation probability of general undirected graphs. As our main contribution, we introduce the natural alternative of the model proposed in cite, where all individuals interact simultaneously and the result is a compromise between aggressive and non-aggressive individuals. That is, the behavior of the individuals in our new model and in the model of cite can be interpreted as an "aggregation" vs. an "all-or-nothing" strategy, respectively. We prove that our new model of mutual influences admits a emph, which guarantees the convergence of the system for any graph topology and any initial fitness vector of the individuals. Furthermore, we prove fast convergence to the stable state for the case of the complete graph, as well as we provide almost tight bounds on the limit fitness of the individuals. Apart from being important on its own, this new evolutionary model appears to be useful also in the abstract modeling of control mechanisms over invading populations in networks. We demonstrate this by introducing and analyzing two alternative control approaches, for which we bound the time needed to stabilize to the "healthy" state of the system.',

This paper studies how the flexibility offered by network virtualization can be used to improve Quality-of-Service parameters such as latency, while taking into account allocation costs. A generic use case is considered where both the overall demand issued for a certain service (for example, an SAP application in the cloud, or a gaming application) as well as the origins of the requests change over time (e.g., due to time zone effects or due to user mobility), and we present online and optimal offline strategies to compute the number and location of the servers implementing this service. These algorithms also allow us to study the fundamental benefits of dynamic resource allocation compared to static systems. Our simulation results confirm our expectations that the gain of flexible server allocation is particularly high in scenarios with moderate dynamics.',

	{'abstract': u'We introduce a new compile-time notion of type subsumption based on type simulation. We show how to apply this static subsumption relation to support a more intuitive, object oriented approach to generic programming of reusable, high performance container types. As a first step towards an efficient implementation of the resulting type system in a compiler we present a novel algorithm for bidirectional type inference over arbitrary syntax graphs. The algorithm uses the new static type subsumption relation to compress the data that has to be stored for each node in the typeflow graph. During typeflow analysis this means that the set of types for a given node can be symbolically represented using antichains instead of using bitvectors or some other explicit set representation. This results in a typing algorithm that is both flexible and precise and shows good performance on representative instances.',

	{'abstract': u'This paper investigates the capacity problem for some multiple-access scenarios with cooperative transmitters. First, a general Multiple-Access Channel (MAC) with common information, i.e., a scenario where p transmitters send private messages and also a common message to q receivers and each receiver decodes all of the messages, is considered. The capacity region of the discrete memoryless channel is characterized. Then, the general Gaussian fading MAC with common information wherein partial Channel State Information (CSI) is available at the transmitters (CSIT) and perfect CSI is available at the receivers (CSIR) is investigated. A coding theorem is proved for this model that yields an exact characterization of the throughput capacity region. Finally, a two-transmitter/one-receiver Gaussian fading MAC with conferencing encoders with partial CSIT and perfect CSIR is studied and its capacity region is determined. For the Gaussian fading models with CSIR only (transmitters have no access to CSIT), some numerical examples and simulation results are provided for Rayleigh fading.',

Constructed algorithm is a mix of ideas of two algorithms: Klinz &amp; Woeginger partitioning algorithm and Mann &amp; Shapley generating functions algorithm. Time and space complexities of the algorithm are analysed and compared with other known algorithms for the problem. Constructed algorithm has pessimistic time complexity O(n 2^(n/2))and pseudopolynomial complexity O(nq), where q is quota of the voting game. This paper also solves open problem stated by H. Aziz and M. Paterson - existence of the algorithm for calculating Banzhaf power indices of all players with time complexity lower than O(n^2 2^(n/2)). Not only is the answer positive but this can be done keeping the pseudopolynomial complexity of generating functions algorithm in case weights are integers. New open problems are stated.',

	{'abstract': u'In this paper we consider the problem of monitoring detecting separation of agents from a base station in robotic and sensor networks. Such separation can be caused by mobility and/or failure of the agents. While separation/cut detection may be performed by passing messages between a node and the base in static networks, such a solution is impractical for networks with high mobility, since routes are constantly changing. We propose a distributed algorithm to detect separation from the base station. The algorithm consists of an averaging scheme in which every node updates a scalar state by communicating with its current neighbors. We prove that if a node is permanently disconnected from the base station, its state converges to . If a node is connected to the base station in an average sense, even if not connected in any instant, then we show that the expected value of its state converges to a positive number. Therefore, a node can detect if it has been separated from the base station by monitoring its state. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated through simulations, a real system implementation and experiments involving both static as well as mobile networks.',

	{'abstract': u'An admission control scheme should play the role of a coordinator for flows in a data communication network, to provide the guarantees as the medium is shared. The nodes of a wired network can monitor the medium to know the available bandwidth at any point of time. But, in wireless ad hoc networks, a node must consume the bandwidth of neighboring nodes, during a communication. Hence, the consumption of bandwidth by a flow and the availability of resources to any wireless node strictly depend upon the neighboring nodes within its transmission range. We present a scalable and efficient admission control scheme, Multi-hop Bandwidth Management Protocol (MBMP), to support the QoS requirements in multi-hop ad hoc networks. We simulate several options to design MBMP and compare the performances of these options through mathematical analysis and simulation results, and compare its effectiveness with the existing admission control schemes through extensive simulations.',

	{'abstract': u'We study frequency allocation in wireless networks. A wireless network is modeled by an undirected graph, with vertices corresponding to cells. In each vertex we have a certain number of requests, and each of those requests must be assigned a different frequency. Edges represent conflicts between cells, meaning that frequencies in adjacent vertices must be different as well. The objective is to minimize the total number of used frequencies. The offline version of the problem is known to be NP-hard. In the incremental version, requests for frequencies arrive over time and the algorithm is required to assign a frequency to a request as soon as it arrives. Competitive incremental algorithms have been studied for several classes of graphs. For paths, the optimal (asymptotic) ratio is known to be 4/3, while for hexagonal-cell graphs it is between 1.5 and 1.9126. For k-colorable graphs, the ratio of (k+1)/2 can be achieved. In this paper, we prove nearly tight bounds on the asymptotic competitive ratio for bipartite graphs, showing that it is between 1.428 and 1.433. This improves the previous lower bound of 4/3 and upper bound of 1.5. Our proofs are based on reducing the incremental problem to a purely combinatorial (equivalent) problem of constructing set families with certain intersection properties.',

An improved zero decomposition algorithm which can be used to reduce the zero set of an equation system in general form to the union of zero sets of monic proper triangular sets is proposed. As a consequence, we can give an explicit formula for the number of solutions of an equation system. Bitsize complexity for the algorithm is given in the case of Boolean polynomials. We also give a multiplication free characteristic set method for Boolean polynomials, where the sizes of the polynomials are effectively controlled. The algorithms are implemented in the case of Boolean polynomials and extensive experiments show that they are quite efficient for solving certain classes of Boolean equations.',

We use the symmetric alpha stable noise distribution and adopt two models which assume dependent and independent noise components across receive antennas. We derive pairwise error probability (PEP) of orthogonal space-time block codes (STBC) with a benchmark genie-aided receiver (GAR), or the minimum distance receiver (MDR) which is optimal in the Gaussian case. For general space-time codes we propose a maximum-likelihood (ML) receiver, and its approximation at high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The resulting asymptotically optimal receiver (AOR) does not depend on noise parameters and is computationally simple. Monte-Carlo simulations are used to supplement our analytical results and compare the performance of the receivers.',

However, the earliest LP decoders proposed for binary and nonbinary LDPC codes are not suitable for use at moderate and large code lengths. To overcome this problem, Vontobel et al. developed an iterative Low-Complexity LP (LCLP) decoding algorithm for binary LDPC codes. The variable and check node calculations of binary LCLP decoding algorithm are related to those of binary Belief Propagation (BP). The present authors generalized this work to derive an iterative LCLP decoding algorithm for nonbinary linear codes. Contrary to binary LCLP, the variable and check node calculations of this algorithm are in general different from that of nonbinary BP. The overall complexity of nonbinary LCLP decoding is linear in block length; however the complexity of its check node calculations is exponential in the check node degree. In this paper, we propose a modified BCJR algorithm for efficient check node processing in the nonbinary LCLP decoding algorithm. The proposed algorithm has complexity linear in the check node degree. We also introduce an alternative state metric to improve the run time of the proposed algorithm. Simulation results are presented for and nonbinary LDPC codes over .',

	{'abstract': u'It is important to enable reasoning about the meaning and possible effects of updates to ensure that the updated system operates correctly. A formal, mathematical model of dynamic update should be developed, in order to understand by both users and implementors of update technology what design choices can be considered. In this paper, we define a formal calculus , a variant extension of higher-order calculus, to model dynamic updates of component-based software, which is language and technology independent. The calculus focuses on following main concepts: proper granularity of update, timing of dynamic update, state transformation between versions, update failure check and recovery. We describe a series of rule on safe component updates to model some general processes of dynamic update and discuss its reduction semantics coincides with a labelled transition system semantics that illustrate the expressive power of these calculi.',

	{'abstract': u"We consider the problem of identifying a team of skilled individuals for collaboration, in the presence of a social network. Each node in the social network may be an expert in one or more skills. Edge weights specify affinity or collaborative compatibility between respective nodes. Given a project that requires a set of specified number of skilled individuals in each area of expertise, the goal is to identify a team that maximizes the collaborative compatibility. For example, the requirement may be to form a team that has at least three databases experts and at least two theory experts. We explore team formation where the collaborative compatibility objective is measured as the density of the induced subgraph on selected nodes. The problem of maximizing density is NP-hard even when the team requires individuals of only one skill. We present a 3-approximation algorithm that improves upon a naive extension of the previously known algorithm for densest at least subgraph problem. We further show how the same approximation can be extended to a special case of multiple skills. Our problem generalizes the formulation studied by Lappas et al. [KDD '09] who measure team compatibility in terms of diameter or spanning tree costs. Experiments are performed on a crawl of the DBLP graph where individuals can be skilled in at most four areas - theory, databases, data mining, and artificial intelligence. In addition to our main algorithm, we also present heuristic extensions to trade off between the size of the solution and its induced density. These density-based algorithms outperform the diameter-based objective on several metrics for assessing the collaborative compatibility of teams. The solutions suggested are also intuitively meaningful and scale well with the increase in the number of skilled individuals required.",

	{'abstract': u'A set of linearly constrained permutation matrices are proposed for constructing a class of permutation codes. Making use of linear constraints imposed on the permutation matrices, we can formulate a minimum Euclidian distance decoding problem for the proposed class of permutation codes as a linear programming (LP) problem. The main feature of this class of permutation codes, called LP decodable permutation codes, is this LP decodability. It is demonstrated that the LP decoding performance of the proposed class of permutation codes is characterized by the vertices of the code polytope of the code. Two types of linear constraints are discussed; one is structured constraints and another is random constraints. The structured constraints such as pure involution lead to an efficient encoding algorithm. On the other hand, the random constraints enable us to use probabilistic methods for analyzing several code properties such as the average cardinality and the average weight distribution.',

Therefore undertaking a user experience (UX) study is crucial to ensure that a game achieves both critical and financial success. However, traditional usability methods (observation, subjective reporting, questionnaire, and interview) have a number of limitations on game user research. In this study we capture player's physiological measures during a gameplay session, to indicate micro-events that have caused changes in their body signals. At the post-gameplay interviews we ask participants to comment and describe their feelings on the selected events. The aim of this study is not to over-interpret physiological measures, but on using blips in measures to help identify key points in a game, which we then use to investigate further with the participant. This approach provides a method that can identify not only the negative user experience and usability issues but also the events which have a positive impact on player's experience.",

	{'abstract': u'A well-known result by Palamidessi tells us that pimix (the pi-calculus with mixed choice) is more expressive than pisep (its subset with only separate choice). The proof of this result argues with their different expressive power concerning leader election in symmetric networks. Later on, Gorla offered an arguably simpler proof that, instead of leader election in symmetric networks, employed the reducibility of incestual processes (mixed choices that include both enabled senders and receivers for the same channel) when running two copies in parallel. In both proofs, the role of breaking (initial) symmetries is more or less apparent. In this paper, we shed more light on this role by re-proving the above result - based on a proper formalization of what it means to break symmetries without referring to another layer of the distinguishing problem domain of leader election. Both Palamidessi and Gorla rephrased their results by stating that there is no uniform and reasonable encoding from pimix into pisep. We indicate how the respective proofs can be adapted and exhibit the consequences of varying notions of uniformity and reasonableness. In each case, the ability to break initial symmetries turns out to be essential.',

	{'abstract': u'This paper introduces a new theory of multiparty session types based on symmetric sum types, by which we can type non-deterministic orchestration choice behaviours. While the original branching type in session types can represent a choice made by a single participant and accepted by others determining how the session proceeds, the symmetric sum type represents a choice made by agreement among all the participants of a session. Such behaviour can be found in many practical systems, including collaborative workflow in healthcare systems for clinical practice guidelines (CPGs). Processes using the symmetric sums can be embedded into the original branching types using conductor processes. We show that this type-driven embedding preserves typability, satisfies semantic soundness and completeness, and meets the encodability criteria adapted to the typed setting. The theory leads to an efficient implementation of a prototypical tool for CPGs which automatically translates the original CPG specifications from a representation called the Process Matrix to symmetric sum types, type checks programs and executes them.',

	{'abstract': u'Multiple Input Double Output (MIDO) asymmetric space-time codes for 4 transmit antennas and 2 receive antennas can be employed in the downlink from base stations to portable devices. Previous MIDO code constructions with low Maximum Likelihood (ML) decoding complexity, full diversity and the non-vanishing determinant (NVD) property are mostly based on cyclic division algebras. In this paper, a new family of MIDO codes with the NVD property based on crossed-product algebras over Q is introduced. Fast decodability follows naturally from the structure of the codewords which consist of four generalized Alamouti blocks. The associated ML complexity order is the lowest known for full-rate MIDO codes (O(M^) instead of O(M^) with respect to the real constellation size M). Numerical simulations show that these codes have a performance from comparable up to 1dB gain compared to the best known MIDO code with the same complexity.',

	{'abstract': u'Sound behavioral equations on open terms may become unsound after conservative extensions of the underlying operational semantics. Providing criteria under which such equations are preserved is extremely useful; in particular, it can avoid the need to repeat proofs when extending the specified language. This paper investigates preservation of sound equations for several notions of bisimilarity on open terms: closed-instance (ci-)bisimilarity and formal-hypothesis (fh-)bisimilarity, both due to Robert de Simone, and hypothesis-preserving (hp-)bisimilarity, due to Arend Rensink. For both fh-bisimilarity and hp-bisimilarity, we prove that arbitrary sound equations on open terms are preserved by all disjoint extensions which do not add labels. We also define slight variations of fh- and hp-bisimilarity such that all sound equations are preserved by arbitrary disjoint extensions. Finally, we give two sets of syntactic criteria (on equations, resp. operational extensions) and prove each of them to be sufficient for preserving ci-bisimilarity.',

Multi-CCS is equipped with a labeled transition system semantics, which makes use of a minimal structural congruence.

This is the first rich process calculus, including CCS as a subcalculus, which receives a semantics in terms of unsafe, labeled P/T nets.

	{'abstract': u'Multiple measurement vector (MMV) problem addresses the identification of unknown input vectors that share common sparse support. The MMV problems had been traditionally addressed either by sensor array signal processing or compressive sensing. However, recent breakthrough in this area such as compressive MUSIC (CS-MUSIC) or subspace-augumented MUSIC (SA-MUSIC) optimally combines the compressive sensing (CS) and array signal processing such that supports are first found by CS and the remaining supports are determined by generalized MUSIC criterion, where and denote the sparsity and the independent snapshots, respectively. Even though such hybrid approach significantly outperforms the conventional algorithms, its performance heavily depends on the correct identification of partial support by compressive sensing step, which often deteriorate the overall performance. The main contribution of this paper is, therefore, to show that as long as correct supports are included in any -sparse CS solution, the optimal partial support can be found using a subspace fitting criterion, significantly improving the overall performance of CS-MUSIC. Furthermore, unlike the single measurement CS counterpart that requires infinite SNR for a perfect support recovery, we can derive an information theoretic sufficient condition for the perfect recovery using CS-MUSIC under a SNR scenario.',

	{'abstract': u'Timed automata and register automata are well-known models of computation over timed and data words respectively. The former has clocks that allow to test the lapse of time between two events, whilst the latter includes registers that can store data values for later comparison. Although these two models behave in appearance differently, several decision problems have the same (un)decidability and complexity results for both models. As a prominent example, emptiness is decidable for alternating automata with one clock or register, both with non-primitive recursive complexity. This is not by chance. This work confirms that there is indeed a tight relationship between the two models. We show that a run of a timed automaton can be simulated by a register automaton, and conversely that a run of a register automaton can be simulated by a timed automaton. Our results allow to transfer complexity and decidability results back and forth between these two kinds of models. We justify the usefulness of these reductions by obtaining new results on register automata.',

	{'abstract': u'We introduce a new criterion, replacement freeness, to discern the relative expressiveness of process calculi. Intuitively, a calculus is strongly replacement free if replacing, within an enclosing context, a process that cannot perform any visible action by an arbitrary process never inhibits the capability of the resulting process to perform a visible action. We prove that there exists no compositional and interaction sensitive encoding of a not strongly replacement free calculus into any strongly replacement free one. We then define a weaker version of replacement freeness, by only considering replacement of closed processes, and prove that, if we additionally require the encoding to preserve name independence, it is not even possible to encode a non replacement free calculus into a weakly replacement free one. As a consequence of our encodability results, we get that many calculi equipped with priority are not replacement free and hence are not encodable into mainstream calculi like CCS and pi-calculus, that instead are strongly replacement free. We also prove that variants of pi-calculus with match among names, pattern matching or polyadic synchronization are only weakly replacement free, hence they are separated both from process calculi with priority and from mainstream calculi.',

	{'abstract': u'We introduce a model of the Relentless Congestion Control proposed by Matt Mathis. Relentless Congestion Control (RCC) is a modification of the AIMD (Additive Increase Multiplicative Decrease) congestion control which consists in decreasing the TCP congestion window by the number of lost segments instead of halving it. Despite some on-going discussions at the ICCRG IRTF-group, this congestion control has, to the best of our knowledge, never been modeled. In this paper, we provide an analytical model of this novel congestion control and propose an implementation of RCC for the commonly-used network simulator ns-2. We also improve RCC with the addition of a loss retransmission detection scheme (based on SACK+) to prevent RTO caused by a loss of a retransmission and called this new version RCC+. The proposed models describe both the original RCC algorithm and RCC+ improvement and would allow to better assess the impact of this new congestion control scheme over the network traffic.',

	{'abstract': u"The languages accepted by finite automata are precisely the languages denoted by regular expressions. In contrast, finite automata may exhibit behaviours that cannot be described by regular expressions up to bisimilarity. In this paper, we consider extensions of the theory of regular expressions with various forms of parallel composition and study the effect on expressiveness. First we prove that adding pure interleaving to the theory of regular expressions strictly increases its expressiveness up to bisimilarity. Then, we prove that replacing the operation for pure interleaving by ACP-style parallel composition gives a further increase in expressiveness. Finally, we prove that the theory of regular expressions with ACP-style parallel composition and encapsulation is expressive enough to express all finite automata up to bisimilarity. Our results extend the expressiveness results obtained by Bergstra, Bethke and Ponse for process algebras with (the binary variant of) Kleene's star operation.",

Most known constructions of linear embeddings that satisfy the Johnson-Lindenstrauss property involve randomness. We address the question of explicitly constructing such embedding families and provide a construction with an almost optimal use of randomness: we use O(log(n/delta)log(log(n/delta)/epsilon)) random bits for embedding n dimensions to O(log(1/delta)/epsilon^2) dimensions with error probability at most delta, and distortion at most epsilon. In particular, for delta = 1/poly(n) and fixed epsilon, we use O(log n loglog n) random bits. Previous constructions required at least O(log^2 n) random bits to get polynomially small error.',

	{'abstract': u'We show that the dominating set problem parameterized by solution size is fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) in graphs that do not contain the claw (K(1,3)), the complete bipartite graph on four vertices where the two parts have one and three vertices, respectively) as an induced subgraph. We present an algorithm that uses 2^O(k^2)n^O(1) time and polynomial space to decide whether a claw-free graph on n vertices has a dominating set of size at most k. Note that this parameterization of dominating set is W[2]-hard on the set of all graphs, and thus is unlikely to have an FPT algorithm for graphs in general. The most general class of graphs for which an FPT algorithm was previously known for this parameterization of dominating set is the class of K(i,j)-free graphs, which exclude, for some fixed i,j, the complete bipartite graph K(i,j) as a subgraph. For i,i &gt;= 2, the class of claw-free graphs and any class of K(i,j)-free graphs are not comparable with respect to set inclusion. We thus extend the range of graphs over which this parameterization of dominating set is known to be fixed-parameter tractable. We also show that, in some sense, it is the presence of the claw that makes this parameterization of the dominating set problem hard. More precisely, we show that for any t ?&gt;= 4, the dominating set problem parameterized by the solution size is W[2]-hard in graphs that exclude the t-claw K(1,t) as an induced subgraph. Our arguments also imply that the related connected dominating set and dominating clique problems are W[2]-hard in these graph classes. Finally, we show that for any t, the clique problem parameterized by solution size, which is W[1]-hard on general graphs, is FPT in t-claw-free graphs. Our results add to the small and growing collection of FPT results for graph classes defined by excluded subgraphs, rather than by excluded minors.',

	{'abstract': u'Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) became one of the high technology domains during the last ten years. Real-time applications for them make it necessary to provide the guaranteed Quality of Service (QoS). The main contributions of this paper are a system skeleton and a guaranteed QoS model that are suitable for the WSNs. To do it, we develop a sensor node model based on virtual buffer sharing and present a two-layer scheduling model using the network calculus. With the system skeleton, we develop a guaranteed QoS model, such as the upper bounds on buffer queue length/delay/effective bandwidth, and single-hop/ multi-hops delay/jitter/effective bandwidth. Numerical results show the system skeleton and the guaranteed QoS model are scalable for different types of flows, including the self-similar traffic flows, and the parameters of flow regulators and service curves of sensor nodes affect them. Our proposal leads to buffer dimensioning, guaranteed QoS support and control in the WSNs.',

	{'abstract': u'Power line as an alternative for data transmission is being explored, and also being used to a certain extent. But from the data transfer point of view, power line, as a channel is highly dynamic and hence not quite suitable. To convert the office or home wiring system to a Local Area Network (LAN), adaptive changes are to be made to the existing protocols. In this paper, a slotted transmission scheme is suggested, in which usable timeslots are found out by physically sensing the media. Common usable timeslots for the sender-receiver pair are used for communication. But these will not ensure safe packet delivery since packets may be corrupted on the way during propagation from sender to receiver. Therefore, we also suggest a proximity based retransmission scheme where each machine in the LAN, buffers good packet and machines close to the receiver retransmit on receiving a NACK.',

	{'abstract': u'The interference channel with a cognitive relay consists of a classical interference channel with two sourcedestination pairs and with an additional cognitive relay that has a priori knowledge of the sources\' messages and aids in the sources\' transmission. We derive a new outer bound for this channel using an argument originally devised for the "more capable" broadcast channel, and show the achievability of the proposed outer bound in the "very strong interference" regime, a class of channels where there is no loss in optimality if both destinations decode both messages. This result is analogous to the "very strong interference" capacity result for the classical interference channel and for the cognitive interference channel, and is the first capacity known capacity result for the general interference channel with a cognitive relay.',

	{'abstract': u'This work proposes a novel outer bound for the Gaussian cognitive interference channel in strong interference at the primary receiver based on the capacity of a multi-antenna broadcast channel with degraded message set. It then shows that for the Z-channel, i.e., when the secondary receiver experiences no interference and the primary receiver experiences strong interference, the proposed outer bound not only is the tightest among known bounds but is actually achievable for sufficiently strong interference. The latter is a novel capacity result that from numerical evaluations appears to be generalizable to a larger (i.e., non-Z) class of Gaussian channels.',

	{'abstract': u'The InterFerence Channel with a Cognitive Relay (IFC-CR) consists of a classical two-user interference channel in which the two independent messages are also non-causally known at a cognitive relay node. In this work a special class of IFC-CRs in which the sources do not create interference at the non-intended destinations is analyzed. This special model results in a channel with two non-interfering point-to-point channels whose transmission is aided by an in-band cognitive relay, which is thus referred to as the Parallel Channel with a Cognitive Relay (PC-CR). We determine the capacity of the PC-CR channel to within 3 bits/s/Hz for all channel parameters. In particular, we present several new outer bounds which we achieve to within a constant gap by proper selection of Gaussian input distributions in a simple rate-splitting and superposition coding-based inner bound. The inner and outer bounds are numerically evaluated to show that the actual gap can be far less than 3 bits/s/Hz.',

	{'abstract': u'The ideas of wireless network coding at the physical layer promise high throughput gains in wireless systems with relays and multi-way traffic flows. This gain can be ascribed to two principles: (1) joint transmission of multiple communication flows and (2) usage of emph information to cancel the interference. In this paper we use these principles to devise new transmission schemes in wireless cellular systems that feature both users served directly by the base stations (direct users) and users served through relays (relayed users). We present four different schemes for emph of uplink and downlink traffic in which one direct and one relayed user are served. These schemes are then used as building blocks in multi-user scenarios, where we present several schemes for scheduling pairs of users for coordinated transmissions. The optimal scheme involves exhaustive search of the best user pair in terms of overall rate. We propose several suboptimal scheduling schemes, which perform closely to the optimal scheme. The numerical results show a substantial increase in the system--level rate with respect to the systems with non--coordinated transmissions.',

	{'abstract': u"In this research, we study the optimization challenges of MANET and cross-layer technique to improve its performance. We propose an adaptive retransmission limits algorithm for IEEE 802.11 MAC to reduce the false link failures and predict the node mobility. We implemented cross layer interaction between physical and MAC layers. The MAC layer utilizes the physical layer information for differentiating false link failure from true link failure. The MAC layer adaptively selects a retransmission limit (short and long) based on the neighbour signal strength and sender node speed information from the physical layer. The proposed approach tracks the signal strength of each node in network and, while transmitting to a neighbour node, if it's received signal strength is high and is received recently then Adaptive MAC persists in its retransmission attempts. As there is high probability that neighbour node is still in transmission range and may be not responding due to some problems other then mobility. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of MANET and show that how our Adaptive MAC greatly improves it. The simulation is done using Network Simulator NS-2.",

	{'abstract': u'A code for communication over the k-receiver additive white Gaussian noise broadcast channel with feedback is presented and analyzed using tools from the theory of linear quadratic Gaussian optimal control. It is shown that the performance of this code depends on the noise correlation at the receivers and it is related to the solution of a discrete algebraic Riccati equation. For the case of independent noises, the sum rate achieved by the proposed code, satisfying average power constraint P, is characterized as 1/2 log (1+P*phi), where the coefficient "phi" in the interval [1,k] quantifies the power gain due to the presence of feedback. When specialized to the case of two receivers, this includes a previous result by Elia and strictly improves upon the code of Ozarow and Leung. When the noises are correlated, the pre-log of the sum-capacity of the broadcast channel with feedback can be strictly greater than one. It is established that for all noise covariance matrices of rank r the pre-log of the sum capacity is at most k-r+1 and, conversely, there exists a noise covariance matrix of rank r for which the proposed code achieves this upper bound. This generalizes a previous result by Gastpar and Wigger for the two-receiver broadcast channel.',

	{'abstract': u"Truthfulness is fragile and demanding. It is oftentimes computationally harder than solving the original problem. Even worse, truthfulness can be utterly destroyed by small uncertainties in a mechanism's outcome. One obstacle is that truthful payments depend on outcomes other than the one realized, such as the lengths of non-shortest-paths in a shortest-path auction. Single-call mechanisms are a powerful tool that circumvents this obstacle --- they implicitly charge truthful payments, guaranteeing truthfulness in expectation using only the outcome realized by the mechanism. The cost of such truthfulness is a trade-off between the expected quality of the outcome and the risk of large payments. We largely settle when and to what extent single-call mechanisms are possible. The first single-call construction was discovered by Babaioff, Kleinberg, and Slivkins [BKS10] in single-parameter domains. They give a transformation that turns any monotone, single-parameter allocation rule into a truthful-in-expectation single-call mechanism. Our first result is a natural complement to [BKS10]: we give a new transformation that produces a single-call VCG mechanism from any allocation rule for which VCG payments are truthful. Second, in both the single-parameter and VCG settings, we precisely characterize the possible transformations, showing that that a wide variety of transformations are possible but that all take a very simple form. Finally, we study the inherent trade-off between the expected quality of the outcome and the risk of large payments. We show that our construction and that of [BKS10] simultaneously optimize a variety of metrics in their respective domains. As an example, we analyze pay-per-click advertising auctions, where the truthfulness of the standard VCG-based auction is easily broken when the auctioneer's estimated click-through-rates are imprecise.",

	{'abstract': u'Random Linear Network Coding (RLNC) has emerged as a powerful tool for robust high-throughput multicast. Projection analysis - a recently introduced technique - shows that the distributed packetized RLNC protocol achieves (order) optimal and perfectly pipelined information dissemination in many settings. In the original approach to RNLC intermediate nodes code together all available information. This requires intermediate nodes to keep considerable data available for coding. Moreover, it results in a coding complexity that grows linearly with the size of this data. While this has been identified as a problem, approaches that combine queuing theory and network coding have heretofore not provided a succinct representation of the memory needs of network coding at intermediates nodes. This paper shows the surprising result that, in all settings with a continuous stream of data, network coding continues to perform optimally even if only one packet per node is kept in active memory and used for computations. This leads to an extremely simple RLNC protocol variant with drastically reduced requirements on computational and memory resources. By extending the projection analysis, we show that in all settings in which the RLNC protocol was proven to be optimal its finite memory variant performs equally well. In the same way as the original projection analysis, our technique applies in a wide variety of network models, including highly dynamic topologies that can change completely at any time in an adversarial fashion.',

	{'abstract': u"Push message delivery, where a client maintains an ``always-on'' connection with a server in order to be notified of a (asynchronous) message arrival in real-time, is increasingly being used in Internet services. The key message in this paper is that push message delivery on the World Wide Web is not scalable for servers, intermediate network elements, and battery-operated mobile device clients. We present a measurement analysis of a commercially deployed WWW push email service to highlight some of these issues. Next, we suggest content-based optimization to reduce the always-on connection requirement of push messaging. Our idea is based on exploiting the periodic nature of human-to-human messaging. We show how machine learning can accurately model the times of a day or week when messages are least likely to arrive; and turn off always-on connections these times. We apply our approach to a real email data set and our experiments demonstrate that the number of hours of active always-on connections can be cut by half while still achieving real-time message delivery for up to 90% of all messages.",

	{'abstract': u"We study the problem of selling a resource through an auction mechanism. The winning buyer in turn develops this resource to generate profit. Two forms of payment are considered: charging the winning buyer a one-time payment, or an initial payment plus a profit sharing contract (PSC). We consider a symmetric interdependent values model with risk averse or risk neutral buyers and a risk neutral seller. For the second price auction and the English auction, we show that the seller's expected total revenue from the auction where he also takes a fraction of the positive profit is higher than the expected revenue from the auction with only a one-time payment. Moreover, the seller can generate an even higher expected total revenue if, in addition to taking a fraction of the positive profit, he also takes the same fraction of any loss incurred from developing the resource. Moving beyond simple PSCs, we show that the auction with a PSC from a very general class generates higher expected total revenue than the auction with only a one-time payment. Finally, we show that suitable PSCs provide higher expected total revenue than a one-time payment even when the incentives of the winning buyer to develop the resource must be addressed by the seller.",

The nonlinear model describing the relative dynamics of the vehicles is interpreted as linear uncertain system, with the leader robot acting as an external disturbance. The VMP is then reformulated as a linear constrained regulation problem with additive disturbances (DLCRP). Positive D-invariance conditions for linear uncertain systems with parametric disturbance matrix are introduced and used to solve the VMP when box bounds on the state, control input and disturbance are considered. The proposed design procedure is shown to be easily adaptable to more general working scenarios.

	{'abstract': u'We face the following dilemma for designing low-density parity-check codes (LDPC) for quantum error correction. 1) The row weights of parity-check should be large: The minimum distances are bounded above by the minimum row weights of parity-check matrices of constituent classical codes. Small minimum distance tends to result in poor decoding performance at the error-floor region. 2) The row weights of parity-check matrices should not be large: The sum-product decoding performance at the water-fall region is degraded as the row weight increases. Recently, Kudekar et al. showed spatially-coupled (SC) LDPC codes exhibit capacity-achieving performance for classical channels. SC LDPC codes have both large row weight and capacity-achieving error-floor and water-fall performance. In this paper, we design SC LDPC-CSS (Calderbank, Shor and Steane) codes for quantum error correction over the depolarizing channels.',

Notably, interference alignment and sum-rate based algorithms such as the maximum signal-to-interference-plus noise (max-SINR) algorithm are considered. Optimal linear beamforming under interference alignment consists of two layers; an inner precoder and decoder (or receive filter) accomplish interference alignment to eliminate inter-user interference, and an outer precoder and decoder diagonalize the effective single-user channel resulting from the interference alignment by the inner precoder and decoder. The relationship between this two-layer beamforming and the max-SINR algorithm is established at high signal-to-noise ratio. Also, the optimality of the max-SINR algorithm within the class of linear beamforming algorithms, and its local convergence with exponential rate, are established at high signal-to-noise ratio.',

	{'abstract': u'Given a directed graph G and an integer k &gt;= 1, a k-transitive-closure-spanner (k-TCspanner) of G is a directed graph H that has (1) the same transitive-closure as G and (2) diameter at most k. In some applications, the shortcut paths added to the graph in order to obtain small diameter can use Steiner vertices, that is, vertices not in the original graph G. The resulting spanner is called a Steiner transitive-closure spanner (Steiner TC-spanner). Motivated by applications to property reconstruction and access control hierarchies, we concentrate on Steiner TC-spanners of directed acyclic graphs or, equivalently, partially ordered sets. In these applications, the goal is to find a sparsest Steiner k-TC-spanner of a poset G for a given k and G. The focus of this paper is the relationship between the dimension of a poset and the size of its sparsest Steiner TCspanner. The dimension of a poset G is the smallest d such that G can be embedded into a d-dimensional directed hypergrid via an order-preserving embedding. We present a nearly tight lower bound on the size of Steiner 2-TC-spanners of d-dimensional directed hypergrids. It implies better lower bounds on the complexity of local reconstructors of monotone functions and functions with low Lipschitz constant. The proof of the lower bound constructs a dual solution to a linear programming relaxation of the Steiner 2-TC-spanner problem. We also show that one can efficiently construct a Steiner 2-TC-spanner, of size matching the lower bound, for any low-dimensional poset. Finally, we present a lower bound on the size of Steiner k-TC-spanners of d-dimensional posets that shows that the best-known construction, due to De Santis et al., cannot be improved significantly.',

	{'abstract': u'In this paper we consider the problem of high accuracy localization of mobile nodes in a multipath-rich environment where sub-meter accuracies are required. We employ a peer to peer framework where the vehicles/nodes can get pairwise multipath-degraded ranging estimates in local neighborhoods together with a fixed number of anchor nodes. The challenge is to overcome the multipath-barrier with redundancy in order to provide the desired accuracies especially under severe multipath conditions when the fraction of received signals corrupted by multipath is dominating. We invoke a message passing analytical framework based on particle filtering and reveal its high accuracy localization promise through simulations.',

	{'abstract': u"In this paper we discuss the ability of channel codes to enhance cryptographic secrecy. Toward that end, we present the secrecy metric of degrees of freedom in an attacker's knowledge of the cryptogram, which is similar to equivocation. Using this notion of secrecy, we show how a specific practical channel coding system can be used to hide information about the ciphertext, thus increasing the difficulty of cryptographic attacks. The system setup is the wiretap channel model where transmitted data traverse through independent packet erasure channels with public feedback for authenticated ARQ (Automatic Repeat reQuest). The code design relies on puncturing nonsystematic low-density parity-check codes with the intent of inflicting an eavesdropper with stopping sets in the decoder. Furthermore, the design amplifies errors when stopping sets occur such that a receiver must guess all the channel-erased bits correctly to avoid an expected error rate of one half in the ciphertext. We extend previous results on the coding scheme by giving design criteria that reduces the effectiveness of a maximum-likelihood attack to that of a message-passing attack. We further extend security analysis to models with multiple receivers and collaborative attackers. Cryptographic security is enhanced in all these cases by exploiting properties of the physical-layer. The enhancement is accurately presented as a function of the degrees of freedom in the eavesdropper's knowledge of the ciphertext, and is even shown to be present when eavesdroppers have better channel quality than legitimate receivers.",

	{'abstract': u"In this paper, we consider rendering color videos using a non-photo-realistic art form technique commonly called stippling. Stippling is the art of rendering images using point sets, possibly with various attributes like sizes, elementary shapes, and colors. Producing nice stippling is attractive not only for the sake of image depiction but also because it yields a compact vectorial format for storing the semantic information of media. Moreover, stippling is by construction easily tunable to various device resolutions without suffering from bitmap sampling artifacts when resizing. The underlying core technique for stippling images is to compute a centroidal Voronoi tessellation on a well-designed underlying density. This density relates to the image content, and is used to compute a weighted Voronoi diagram. By considering videos as image sequences and initializing properly the stippling of one image by the result of its predecessor, one avoids undesirable point flickering artifacts and can produce stippled videos that nevertheless still exhibit noticeable artifacts. To overcome this, our method improves over the naive scheme by considering dynamic point creation and deletion according to the current scene semantic complexity, and show how to effectively vectorize video while adjusting for both color and contrast characteristics. Furthermore, we explain how to produce high quality stippled ``videos'' (eg., fully dynamic spatio-temporal point sets) for media containing various fading effects, like quick motions of objects or progressive shot changes. We report on practical performances of our implementation, and present several stippled video results rendered on-the-fly using our viewer that allows both spatio-temporal dynamic rescaling (eg., upscale vectorially frame rate).",

	{'abstract': u'Concurrency has been rapidly gaining importance in general-purpose computing, caused by the recent turn towards multicore processing architectures. As a result, an increasing number of developers have to learn to write concurrent programs, a task that is known to be hard even for the expert. Language designers are therefore working on languages that promise to make concurrent programming "easier" than using traditional thread libraries. However, the claim that a new language is more usable than another cannot be supported by purely theoretical considerations, but calls for empirical studies. In this paper, we present the design of a study to compare concurrent programming languages with respect to comprehending and debugging existing programs and writing correct new programs. A critical challenge for such a study is avoiding the bias that might be introduced during the training phase and when interpreting participants\' solutions. We address these issues by the use of self-study material and an evaluation scheme that exposes any subjective decisions of the corrector, or eliminates them altogether. We apply our design to a comparison of two object-oriented languages for concurrency, multithreaded Java and SCOOP (Simple Concurrent Object-Oriented Programming), in an academic setting. We obtain results in favor of SCOOP even though the study participants had previous training in Java Threads.',

	{'abstract': u'A 60 GHz wireless Gigabit Ethernet (G.E.) communication system capable of near gigabit data rate has been developed at IETR. The realized system covers 2 GHz available bandwidth. This paper describes the design and realization of the overall system including the baseband (BB), intermediate frequency (IF) and radiofrequency (RF) blocks. A differential binary shift keying (DBPSK) modulation and a differential demodulation are adopted at IF. In the BB processing block, an original byte/frame synchronization technique is designed to provide a small value of the preamble false alarm and missing probabilities. For the system performances, two different real scenarios are investigated: measurements carried out in a large gym and in hallways. Bit error rate (BER) measurements have been performed in different configurations: with/without RS (255, 239) coding, with frame synchronization using 32/64 bits preambles. As shown by simulation, the 64 bits preamble provides sufficient robustness and improves the system performance in term of BER. At a data rate of 875 Mbps, a BER of 10-8 was measured at 30 m using high gain antennas for line of-sight (LOS) conditions.',

	{'abstract': u'In this work we study zero vs. epsilon-error capacity in network coding instances. For multicast network coding it is well known that all rates that can be delivered with arbitrarily small error probability can also be delivered with zero error probability; that is, the epsilon-error multicast capacity region and zero-error multicast capacity region are identical. For general network coding instances in which all sources originate at the same source node, Chan and Grant recently showed [ISIT 2010] that, again, epsilon-error communication has no rate advantage over zero-error communication. We start by revisiting the setting of co-located sources, where we present an alternative proof to that given by Chan and Grant. While the new proof is based on similar core ideas, our constructive strategy complements the previous argument.We then extend our results to the setting of index coding, which is a special and representative form of network coding that encapsulates the "source coding with side information" problem. Finally, we consider the "edge removal" problem (recently studied by Jalali, Effros, and Ho in [Allerton 2010] and [ITA 2011]) that aims to quantify the loss in capacity associated with removing a single edge from a given network. Using our proof for co-located sources, we tie the "zero vs. epsilon-error" problem in general network coding instances with the "edge removal" problem. Loosely speaking, we show that the two problem are equivalent.',

	{'abstract': u'During the past few years, we have observed the emergence of new applications that use multicast transmission. For a multicast routing algorithm to be applicable in optical networks, it must route data only to group members, optimize and maintain loop-free routes, and concentrate the routes on a subset of network links. For an all-optical switch to play the role of a branching router, it must be equipped with a light splitter. Light splitters are expensive equipments and therefore it will be very expensive to implement splitters on all optical switches. Optical light splitters are only implemented on some optical switches. That limited availability of light splitters raises a new problem when we want to implement multicast protocols in optical network (because usual multicast protocols make the assumption that all nodes have branching capabilities). Another issue is the knowledge of the locations of light splitters in the optical network. Nodes in the network should be able to identify the locations of light splitters scattered in the optical network so it can construct multicast trees. These problems must be resolved by implementing a multicast routing protocol that must take into consideration that not all nodes can be branching node. As a result, a new signaling process must be implemented so that light paths can be created, spanning from source to the group members.',

	{'abstract': u'Recently, Vontobel showed the relationship between Bethe free energy and annealed free energy for protograph factor graph ensembles. In this paper, annealed free energy of any random regular, irregular and Poisson factor graph ensembles are connected to Bethe free energy. The annealed free energy is expressed as the solution of maximization problem whose stationary condition equations coincide with equations of belief propagation since the contribution to partition function of particular type of variable and factor nodes has similar form of minus Bethe free energy. It gives simple derivation of replica symmetric solution. As consequence, it is shown that on replica symmetric ansatz, replica symmetric solution and annealed free energy are equal for regular ensemble.',

	{'abstract': u'This paper introduces a novel type of memetic algorithm based Topology and Weight Evolving Artificial Neural Network (TWEANN) system called DX Neural Network (DXNN). DXNN implements a number of interesting features, amongst which is: a simple and database friendly tuple based encoding method, a 2 phase neuroevolutionary approach aimed at removing the need for speciation due to its intrinsic population diversification effects, a new "Targeted Tuning Phase" aimed at dealing with "the curse of dimensionality", and a new Random Intensity Mutation (RIM) method that removes the need for crossover algorithms. The paper will discuss DXNN\'s architecture, mutation operators, and its built in feature selection method that allows for the evolved systems to expand and incorporate new sensors and actuators. I then compare DXNN to other state of the art TWEANNs on the standard double pole balancing benchmark, and demonstrate its superior ability to evolve highly compact solutions faster than its competitors. Then a set of oblation experiments is performed to demonstrate how each feature of DXNN effects its performance, followed by a set of experiments which demonstrate the platform\'s ability to create NN populations with exceptionally high diversity profiles. Finally, DXNN is used to evolve artificial robots in a set of two dimensional open-ended food gathering and predator-prey simulations, demonstrating the system\'s ability to produce ever more complex Neural Networks, and the system\'s applicability to the domain of robotics, artificial life, and coevolution.',

	{'abstract': u"The cognitive interference channel with unidirectional destination cooperation (CIFC-UDC) is a cognitive interference channel (CIFC) where the cognitive (secondary) destination not only decodes the information sent from its sending dual but also helps enhance the communication of the primary user. This channel model is an extension of the original CIFC to achieve a win-win solution under the coexistence condition. From an information-theoretic perspective, the CIFC-UDC comprises a broadcast channel (BC), a relay channel (RC) and a partially cooperative relay broadcast channel (PCRBC), and can be degraded to any one of them. Our main result is the establishment of a new unified achieva-ble rate region for the CIFC-UDC which is the largest known to date and can be explicitly shown to include the previous result proposed by Chu and the largest known rate regions for the BC, the RC and the PCRBC. In addition, an interesting viewpoint on the unidirectional destination cooperation in the CIFC-UDC is discussed: to enable the decoder of the primary user to perform interference mitigation can be considered as a complementary idea to the interference mitigation via Gel'fand-Pinsker precod-ing in the CIFC proposed by Devroye et al. Henceforth, by com-bing these two ideas, the interferences caused at both the desti-nations can be alleviated. Lastly, an outer bound is presented and proved to be tight for a class of the CIFC-UDC, resulting in the characterization of the capacity region for this class.",

	{'abstract': u'In this paper, we propose a selection region based multihop routing protocol with directional antennas for wireless mobile ad hoc networks, where the selection region is defined by two parameters: a reference distance and the beamwidth of the directional antenna. At each hop, we choose the nearest node to the transmitter within the selection region as the next hop relay. By maximizing the expected density of progress, we present an upper bound for the optimum reference distance and derive the relationship between the optimum reference distance and the optimum transmission probability. Compared with the results with routing strategy using omnidirectional antennas in cite, we find interestingly that the optimum transmission probability is a constant independent of the beamwidth, the expected density of progress with the new routing strategy is increased significantly, and the computational complexity involved in the relay selection is also greatly reduced.',

	{'abstract': u'In this paper, we propose a novel adaptive modulation and coding (AMC) algorithm dedicated to reduce the feedback frequency of the channel state information (CSI). There have been already plenty of works on AMC so as to exploit the bandwidth more efficiently with the CSI feedback to the transmitter. However, in some occasions, frequent CSI feedback is not favorable in these systems. This work considers finite-state Markov chain (FSMC) based channel prediction to alleviate the feedback while maximizing the overall throughput. We derive the close-form of the frame error rate (FER) based on channel prediction using limited CSI feedback. In addition, instead of switching settings according to the CSI, we also provide means to combine both CSI and FER as the switching parameter. Numerical results illustrate that the average throughput of the proposed algorithm has significant performance improvement over fixed modulation and coding while the CSI feedback being largely reduced.',

	{'abstract': u'The tolerancing step has a great importance in the design process. It characterises the relationship between the different sectors of the product life cycle: Design, Manufacturing and Control. We can distinguish several methods to assist the tolerancing process in the design. Based on arithmetic and statistical method, this paper presents a new approach of analysis and verification of tolerances. The chosen approach is based on the Worst Case Method as an arithmetic method and Monte Carlo method as a statistical method. In this paper, we compare these methods and we present our main approach, which is validated using an example of 1 D tolerancing.',

	{'abstract': u'In automata theory, the quantum computation has been widely examined for finite state machines, known as quantum finite automata (QFAs), and less attention has been given to the QFAs augmented with counters or stacks. Moreover, to our knowledge, there is no result related to QFAs having more than one input head. In this paper, we focus on such generalizations of QFAs whose input head(s) operate(s) in one-way or realtime mode and present many superiority of them to their classical counterparts. Furthermore, we propose some open problems and conjectures in order to investigate the power of quantumness better. We also give some new results on classical computation.',

	{'abstract': u'The goal of this paper is the development of a novel approach for the problem of Noise Removal, based on the theory of Reproducing Kernels Hilbert Spaces (RKHS). The problem is cast as an optimization task in a RKHS, by taking advantage of the celebrated semiparametric Representer Theorem. Examples verify that in the presence of gaussian noise the proposed method performs relatively well compared to wavelet based technics and outperforms them significantly in the presence of impulse or mixed noise.

	{'abstract': u"This paper considers a communication network comprised of two nodes, which have no mutual direct communication links, communicating two-way with the aid of a common relay node (RN), also known as separated two-way relay (TWR) channel. We first recall a cut-set outer bound for the set of rates in the context of this network topology assuming full-duplex transmission capabilities. Then, we derive a new achievable rate region based on hash-and-forward (HF) relaying where the RN does not attempt to decode but instead hashes its received signal, and show that under certain channel conditions it coincides with Shannon's inner-bound for the two-way channel [1]. Moreover, for binary adder TWR channel with additive noise at the nodes and the RN we provide a detailed capacity achieving coding scheme based on structure codes.",

We formally prove the correctness of our approach. We show that the complexity of finding a policy for a reinforcement learning problem in our approach is NP-complete. In addition, we show that any reinforcement learning problem can be encoded as a classical logic program with answer set semantics. We also show that a reinforcement learning problem can be encoded as a SAT problem. We present a new high level action description language that allows the factored representation of POMDP. Moreover, we modify the original model of POMDP so that it be able to distinguish between knowledge producing actions and actions that change the environment.',

Based on these bits, the reconstructor wishes to select a subset of that contains all the points in the pattern. It is shown that, if the point pattern is produced by a homogeneous Poisson process of intensity , and if the reconstructor is restricted to select a subset of average Lebesgue measure not exceeding , then, as tends to infinity, the minimum number of bits per second needed by the encoder is . It is also shown that, as tends to infinity, any point pattern on containing no more than points can be successfully described using bits per second in this sense.

	{'abstract': u"It is known that a high-dimensional sparse vector x* in R^n can be recovered from low-dimensional measurements y= A^ x* (m&lt;n) . In this paper, we investigate the recovering ability of l_p-minimization (0&lt;=p&lt;=1) as p varies, where l_p-minimization returns a vector with the least l_p ``norm'' among all the vectors x satisfying Ax=y. Besides analyzing the performance of strong recovery where l_p-minimization needs to recover all the sparse vectors up to certain sparsity, we also for the first time analyze the performance of ``weak'' recovery of l_p-minimization (0&lt;=p&lt;1) where the aim is to recover all the sparse vectors on one support with fixed sign pattern. When m/n goes to 1, we provide sharp thresholds of the sparsity ratio that differentiates the success and failure via l_p-minimization. For strong recovery, the threshold strictly decreases from 0.5 to 0.239 as p increases from 0 to 1. Surprisingly, for weak recovery, the threshold is 2/3 for all p in [0,1), while the threshold is 1 for l_1-minimization. We also explicitly demonstrate that l_p-minimization (p&lt;1) can return a denser solution than l_1-minimization. For any m/n&lt;1, we provide bounds of sparsity ratio for strong recovery and weak recovery respectively below which l_p-minimization succeeds with overwhelming probability. Our bound of strong recovery improves on the existing bounds when m/n is large. Regarding the recovery threshold, l_p-minimization has a higher threshold with smaller p for strong recovery; the threshold is the same for all p for sectional recovery; and l_1-minimization can outperform l_p-minimization for weak recovery. These are in contrast to traditional wisdom that l_p-minimization has better sparse recovery ability than l_1-minimization since it is closer to l_0-minimization. We provide an intuitive explanation to our findings and use numerical examples to illustrate the theoretical predictions.",

	{'abstract': u'In this paper we study the strengths and limitations of collaborative teams of simple agents. In particular, we discuss the efficient use of "ant robots" for covering a connected region on the Z^ grid, whose area is unknown in advance, and which expands at a given rate, where is the initial size of the connected region. We show that regardless of the algorithm used, and the robots\' hardware and software specifications, the minimal number of robots required in order for such coverage to be possible is Omega(). In addition, we show that when the region expands at a sufficiently slow rate, a team of Theta( sqrt) robots could cover it in at most O(n^ ln n) time. This completion time can even be achieved by myopic robots, with no ability to directly communicate with each other, and where each robot is equipped with a memory of size O(1) bits w.r.t the size of the region (therefore, the robots cannot maintain maps of the terrain, nor plan complete paths). Regarding the coverage of non-expanding regions in the grid, we improve the current best known result of O(n^) by demonstrating an algorithm that guarantees such a coverage with completion time of O( frac n^ + n) in the worst case, and faster for shapes of perimeter length which is shorter than O(n).',

	{'abstract': u'Open Answer Set Programming (OASP) is an attractive framework for integrating ontologies and rules. In general OASP is undecidable. In previous work we provided a tableau-based algorithm for satisfiability checking w.r.t. forest logic programs, a decidable fragment of OASP, which has the forest model property. In this paper we introduce an optimized version of that algorithm achieved by means of a knowledge compilation technique. So-called unit completion structures, which are possible building blocks of a forest model, in the form of trees of depth 1, are computed in an initial step of the algorithm. Repeated computations are avoided by using these structures in a pattern-matching style when constructing a model. Furthermore we identify and discard redundant unit completion structures: a structure is redundant if there is another structure which can always replace the original structure in a forest model.',

	{'abstract': u'In this paper, we study cyclic stabiliser codes over of length dividing for some positive integer . We call these -Frobenius codes or just Frobenius codes for short. We give methods to construct them and show that they have efficient decoding algorithms. An important subclass of stabiliser codes are the linear stabiliser codes. For linear Frobenius codes we have stronger results: We completely characterise all linear Frobenius codes. As a consequence, we show that for every integer that divides for an odd , there are no linear cyclic codes of length . On the other hand for even , we give an explicit method to construct all of them. This gives us a many explicit example of Frobenius codes which include the well studied Laflamme code. We show that the classical notion of BCH distance can be generalised to all the Frobenius codes that we construct, including the non-linear ones, and show that the algorithm of Berlekamp can be generalised to correct quantum errors within the BCH limit. This gives, for the first time, a family of codes that are neither CSS nor linear for which efficient decoding algorithm exits. The explicit examples that we construct are summarised in Table ref and explained in detail in Tables ref (linear case) and ref (non-linear case).',

	{'abstract': u'Multivariate linear regression models suggest a trade-off in allocations of national R&amp;D investments. Government funding, and spending in the higher education sector, seem to encourage publications, whereas other components such as industrial funding, and spending in the business sector, encourage patenting. Our results help explain why the US trails the EU in publications, because of its focus on industrial funding - some 70% of its total R&amp;D investment. Conversely, it also helps explain why the EU trails the US in patenting. Government funding is indicated as a negative incentive to high-quality patenting. The models here can also be used to predict an output indicator for a country, once the appropriate input indicator is known. This usually is done within a dataset for a single year, but the process can be extended to predict outputs a few years into the future, if reasonable forecasts can be made of the input indicators. We provide new forecasts about the further relationships of the US, the EU-27, and the PRC in the case of publishing. Models for individual countries may be more successful, however, than regression models whose parameters are averaged over a set of countries.',

	{'abstract': u'In cloud computing environments, a large number of users access data stored in highly available storage systems. To provide good performance to geographically disperse users and allow operation even in the presence of failures or network partitions, these systems often rely on optimistic replication solutions that guarantee only eventual consistency. In this scenario, it is important to be able to accurately and efficiently identify updates executed concurrently. In this paper, first we review, and expose problems with current approaches to causality tracking in optimistic replication: these either lose information about causality or do not scale, as they require replicas to maintain information that grows linearly with the number of clients or updates. Then, we propose a novel solution that fully captures causality while being very concise in that it maintains information that grows linearly only with the number of servers that register updates for a given data element, bounded by the degree of replication.',

	{'abstract': u'In this work, the joint precoding across two distant transmitters (TXs), sharing the knowledge of the data symbols to be transmitted, to two receivers (RXs), each equipped with one antenna, is discussed. We consider a distributed channel state information (CSI) configuration where each TX has its own local estimate of the channel and no communication is possible between the TXs. Based on the distributed CSI configuration, we introduce a concept of distributed MIMO precoding. We focus on the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime such that the two TXs aim at designing a precoding matrix to cancel the interference. Building on the study of the multiple antenna broadcast channel, we obtain the following key results: We derive the multiplexing gain (MG) as a function of the scaling in the SNR of the number of bits quantizing at each TX the channel to a given RX. Particularly, we show that the conventional Zero Forcing precoder is not MG maximizing, and we provide a precoding scheme optimal in terms of MG. Beyond the established MG optimality, simulations show that the proposed precoding schemes achieve better performances at intermediate SNR than known linear precoders.',

	{'abstract': u'We present probabilistic arithmetic automata (PAAs), a general model to describe chains of operations whose operands depend on chance, along with two different algorithms to exactly calculate the distribution of the results obtained by such probabilistic calculations. PAAs provide a unifying framework to approach many problems arising in computational biology and elsewhere. Here, we present five different applications, namely (1) pattern matching statistics on random texts, including the computation of the distribution of occurrence counts, waiting time and clump size under HMM background models; (2) exact analysis of window-based pattern matching algorithms; (3) sensitivity of filtration seeds used to detect candidate sequence alignments; (4) length and mass statistics of peptide fragments resulting from enzymatic cleavage reactions; and (5) read length statistics of 454 sequencing reads. The diversity of these applications indicates the flexibility and unifying character of the presented framework. While the construction of a PAA depends on the particular application, we single out a frequently applicable construction method for pattern statistics: We introduce deterministic arithmetic automata (DAAs) to model deterministic calculations on sequences, and demonstrate how to construct a PAA from a given DAA and a finite-memory random text model. We show how to transform a finite automaton into a DAA and then into the corresponding PAA.',

This is of a significant practical interest, since it has a potential to generate additional value of the systems through, for example, introduction of new devices and only a software update of the access points or base stations, without incurring additional cost for infrastructure hardware installation. The place to look for such an opportunity is the communication protocol and we use the term *protocol coding* to refer to strategies for sending information by using the degrees of freedom available when one needs to decide the actions taken by a particular communication protocol. In this paper we consider protocol coding that gives a rise to *secondary communication channels*, defined by combinatorial ordering of the user resources (packets, channels) in a primary (legacy) communication system. We introduce communication models that enable us to compute the capacity of such secondary channels under suitable restrictions imposed by the primary systems. We first show the relation to the capacity of channels with causal channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT), originally considered by Shannon. By using the specific communication setup, we develop an alternative framework for achieving the capacity and we discuss coding strategies that need to be used over the secondary channels. We also discuss some practical features of the secondary channels and their applications that add value to the existing wireless systems.',

	{'abstract': u'The Honey-Bee game is a two-player board game that is played on a connected hexagonal colored grid or (in a generalized setting) on a connected graph with colored nodes. In a single move, a player calls a color and thereby conquers all the nodes of that color that are adjacent to his own current territory. Both players want to conquer the majority of the nodes. We show that winning the game is PSPACE-hard in general, NP-hard on series-parallel graphs, but easy on outerplanar graphs. In the solitaire version, the goal of the single player is to conquer the entire graph with the minimum number of moves. The solitaire version is NP-hard on trees and split graphs, but can be solved in polynomial time on co-comparability graphs.',

	{'abstract': u'This chapter derives the properties of light from the properties of processing, including its ability to be both a wave and a particle, to respond to objects it doesn\'t physically touch, to take all paths to a destination, to choose a route after it arrives, and to spin both ways at once as it moves. Here a photon is an entity program spreading as a processing wave of instances. It becomes a "particle" if any part of it overloads the grid network that runs it, causing the photon program to reboot and restart at a new node. The "collapse of the wave function" is how quantum processing creates what we call a physical photon. This informational approach gives insights into issues like the law of least action, entanglement, superposition, counterfactuals, the holographic principle and the measurement problem. The conceptual cost is that physical reality is a quantum processing output, i.e. virtual.',

	{'abstract': u'Performance and reliability of content access in mobile networks is conditioned by the number and location of content replicas deployed at the network nodes. Location theory has been the traditional, centralized approach to study content replication: computing the number and placement of replicas in a static network can be cast as a facility location problem. The endeavor of this work is to design a practical solution to the above joint optimization problem that is suitable for mobile wireless environments. We thus seek a replication algorithm that is lightweight, distributed, and reactive to network dynamics. We devise a solution that lets nodes (i) share the burden of storing and providing content, so as to achieve load balancing, and (ii) autonomously decide whether to replicate or drop the information, so as to adapt the content availability to dynamic demands and time-varying network topologies. We evaluate our mechanism through simulation, by exploring a wide range of settings, including different node mobility models, content characteristics and system scales. Furthermore, we compare our mechanism to state-of-the-art approaches to content delivery in static and mobile networks. Results show that our mechanism, which uses local measurements only, is: (i) extremely precise in approximating an optimal solution to content placement and replication; (ii) robust against network mobility; (iii) flexible in accommodating various content access patterns. Moreover, our scheme outperforms alternative approaches to content dissemination both in terms of content access delay and access congestion.',

	{'abstract': u'We determine necessary conditions on the structure of symbol error rate (SER) optimal quantizers for limited feedback beamforming in wireless networks with one transmitter-receiver pair and R parallel amplify-and-forward relays. We call a quantizer codebook "small" if its cardinality is less than R, and "large" otherwise. A "d-codebook" depends on the power constraints and can be optimized accordingly, while an "i-codebook" remains fixed. It was previously shown that any i-codebook that contains the single-relay selection (SRS) codebook achieves the full-diversity order, R. We prove the following: Every full-diversity i-codebook contains the SRS codebook, and thus is necessarily large. In general, as the power constraints grow to infinity, the limit of an optimal large d-codebook contains an SRS codebook, provided that it exists. For small codebooks, the maximal diversity is equal to the codebook cardinality. Every diversity-optimal small i-codebook is an orthogonal multiple-relay selection (OMRS) codebook. Moreover, the limit of an optimal small d-codebook is an OMRS codebook. We observe that SRS is nothing but a special case of OMRS for codebooks with cardinality equal to R. As a result, we call OMRS as "the universal necessary condition" for codebook optimality. Finally, we confirm our analytical findings through simulations.',

	{'abstract': u'In a previous FAST paper, I presented a quantitative model of the process of trust building, and showed that trust is accumulated like wealth: the rich get richer. This explained the pervasive phenomenon of adverse selection of trust certificates, as well as the fragility of trust networks in general. But a simple explanation does not always suggest a simple solution. It turns out that it is impossible to alter the fragile distribution of trust without sacrificing some of its fundamental functions. A solution for the vulnerability of trust must thus be sought elsewhere, without tampering with its distribution. This observation was the starting point of the present paper. It explores a different method for securing trust: not by redistributing it, but by mining for its sources. The method used to break privacy is thus also used to secure trust. A high level view of the mining methods that connect the two is provided in terms of *similarity networks*, and *spectral decomposition* of similarity preserving maps. This view may be of independent interest, as it uncovers a common conceptual and structural foundation of mathematical classification theory on one hand, and of the spectral methods of graph clustering and data mining on the other hand.',

	{'abstract': u'The depth of a visible surface of a scene is the distance between the surface and the sensor. Recovering depth information from two-dimensional images of a scene is an important task in computer vision that can assist numerous applications such as object recognition, scene interpretation, obstacle avoidance, inspection and assembly. Various passive depth computation techniques have been developed for computer vision applications. They can be classified into two groups. The first group operates using just one image. The second group requires more than one image which can be acquired using either multiple cameras or a camera whose parameters and positioning can be changed. This project is aimed to find the real depth of the object from the camera which had been used to click the photograph. An n-degree polynomial was formulated, which maps the pixel depth of an image to the real depth. In order to find the coefficients of the polynomial, an experiment was carried out for a particular lens and thus, these coefficients are a unique feature of a particular camera. The procedure explained in this report is a monocular approach for estimation of depth of a scene. The idea involves mapping the Pixel Depth of the object photographed in the image with the Real Depth of the object from the camera lens with an interpolation function. In order to find the parameters of the interpolation function, a set of lines with predefined distance from camera is used, and then the distance of each line from the bottom edge of the picture (as the origin line) is calculated.',

	{'abstract': u'We study a class of stochastic dynamic games that exhibit strategic complementarities between players; formally, in the games we consider, the payoff of a player has increasing differences between her own state and the empirical distribution of the states of other players. Such games can be used to model a diverse set of applications, including network security models, recommender systems, and dynamic search in markets. Stochastic games are generally difficult to analyze, and these difficulties are only exacerbated when the number of players is large (as might be the case in the preceding examples). We consider an approximation methodology called mean field equilibrium to study these games. In such an equilibrium, each player reacts to only the long run average state of other players. We find necessary conditions for the existence of a mean field equilibrium in such games. Furthermore, as a simple consequence of this existence theorem, we obtain several natural monotonicity properties. We show that there exist a "largest" and a "smallest" equilibrium among all those where the equilibrium strategy used by a player is nondecreasing, and we also show that players converge to each of these equilibria via natural myopic learning dynamics; as we argue, these dynamics are more reasonable than the standard best response dynamics. We also provide sensitivity results, where we quantify how the equilibria of such games move in response to changes in parameters of the game (e.g., the introduction of incentives to players).',

	{'abstract': u'As the structural databases continue to expand, efficient methods are required to search similar structures of the query structure from the database. There are many previous works about comparing protein 3D structures and scanning the database with a query structure. However, they generally have limitations on practical use because of large computational and storage requirements. We propose two new types of queries for searching similar sub-structures on the structural database: LSPM (Local Spatial Pattern Matching) and RLSPM (Reverse LSPM). Between two types of queries, we focus on RLSPM problem, because it is more practical and general than LSPM. As a naive algorithm, we adopt geometric hashing techniques to RLSPM problem and then propose our proposed algorithm which improves the baseline algorithm to deal with large-scale data and provide an efficient matching algorithm. We employ the sub-sampling and Z-ordering to reduce the storage requirement and execution time, respectively. We conduct our experiments to show the correctness and reliability of the proposed method. Our experiment shows that the true positive rate is at least 0.8 using the reliability measure.',

It is well known that scheduling schemes that favor links with larger queue length can achieve high throughput performance. However, these queue-length-based schemes could potentially suffer from large (even infinite) packet delays due to the well-known last packet problem, whereby packets belonging to some flows may be excessively delayed due to lack of subsequent packet arrivals. Delay-based schemes have the potential to resolve this last packet problem by scheduling the link based on the delay the packet has encountered. However, characterizing throughput-optimality of these delay-based schemes has largely been an open problem in multihop wireless networks (except in limited cases where the traffic is single-hop.) In this paper, we investigate delay-based scheduling schemes for multihop traffic scenarios with fixed routes. We develop a scheduling scheme based on a new delay metric, and show that the proposed scheme achieves optimal throughput performance. Further, we conduct simulations to support our analytical results, and show that the delay-based scheduler successfully removes excessive packet delays, while it achieves the same throughput region as the queue-length-based scheme.',

Complementation of -automata is crucial in many of these applications. But the problem is non-trivial; even after extensive study during the past four decades, we still have an important type of -automata, namely Streett automata, for which the gap between the current best lower bound and upper bound is substantial, for the Streett index size can be exponential in the number of states .

	{'abstract': u'We give a novel algorithm for enumerating lattice points in any convex body, and give applications to several classic lattice problems, including the Shortest and Closest Vector Problems (SVP and CVP, respectively) and Integer Programming (IP). Our enumeration technique relies on a classical concept from asymptotic convex geometry known as the M-ellipsoid, and uses as a crucial subroutine the recent algorithm of Micciancio and Voulgaris (STOC 2010) for lattice problems in the l_2 norm. As a main technical contribution, which may be of independent interest, we build on the techniques of Klartag (Geometric and Functional Analysis, 2006) to give an expected 2^O(n)-time algorithm for computing an M-ellipsoid for any n-dimensional convex body. As applications, we give deterministic 2^-time and -space algorithms for solving exact SVP, and exact CVP when the target point is sufficiently close to the lattice, on n-dimensional lattices in any (semi-)norm given an M-ellipsoid of the unit ball. In many norms of interest, including all l_p norms, an M-ellipsoid is computable in deterministic poly(n) time, in which case these algorithms are fully deterministic. Here our approach may be seen as a derandomization of the "AKS sieve" for exact SVP and CVP (Ajtai, Kumar, and Sivakumar; STOC 2001 and CCC 2002). As a further application of our SVP algorithm, we derive an expected O(f*(n))^n-time algorithm for Integer Programming, where f*(n) denotes the optimal bound in the so-called "flatness theorem," which satisfies f*(n) = O(n^ polylog(n)) and is conjectured to be f*(n)= Theta(n). Our runtime improves upon the previous best of O(n^)^ by Hildebrand and Koppe (2010).',

	{'abstract': u'Sensing and aggregation of noisy observations should not be considered as separate issues. The quality of collective estimation involves a difficult tradeoff between sensing quality which increases by increasing the number of sensors, and aggregation quality which typically decreases if the number of sensors is too large. We examine a strategy for optimal aggregation for an ensemble of independent sensors with constrained system capacity. We show that in the large capacity limit larger scale aggregation always outperforms smaller scale aggregation at higher noise levels, while below a critical value of noise, there exist moderate scale aggregation levels at which optimal estimation is realized.',

	{'abstract': u'To harmonize the individual architectures of the different commands, services, and agencies dealing with the development and procurement of Command, Control, Communications, Computing, Surveillance, Reconnaissance, and Intelligence (C4ISR) systems, the C4ISR Architecture Framework was developed based on existing and matured modeling techniques and methods. Within a short period, NATO adapted this method family as the NATO Consultation, Command, and Control (C3) System Architecture Framework to harmonize the efforts of the different nations. Based on these products, for every system to be fielded to be used in the US Armed Forces, a C4I Support Plan (C4ISP) has to be developed enabling the integration of the special system into the integrated C4I Architecture. The tool set proposed by these architecture frameworks connects operational views of the military user, system views of the developers, and the technical views for standards and integration methods needed to make the network centric system of systems work. The tools are therefore logically a valuable backbone for Verification, Validation, and Accreditation (VV&amp;A). Their application is not limited to C4ISR systems; they can be used to define requirements and connected solutions and algorithms of Modeling and Simulation (M&amp;S) systems as well. Especially for M&amp;S systems to be used in connection with C4ISR system, the use of the C4ISR Architecture Framework would not only be a help, but can nearly be seen to be necessary to avoid double work and foster reuse and interoperability from the first stages of a project on. To enable the reader to build his own picture, the respective tools used and their application in the context of VV&amp;A will be explained in form of an overview.',

	{'abstract': u"The closest vector problem (CVP) and shortest (nonzero) vector problem (SVP) are the core algorithmic problems on Euclidean lattices. They are central to the applications of lattices in many problems of communications and cryptography. Kannan's emph is a powerful technique for solving the approximate CVP, yet its remarkable practical performance is not well understood. In this paper, the embedding technique is analyzed from a emph (BDD) viewpoint. We present two complementary analyses of the embedding technique: We establish a reduction from BDD to Hermite SVP (via unique SVP), which can be used along with any Hermite SVP solver (including, among others, the Lenstra, Lenstra and Lov 'asz (LLL) algorithm), and show that, in the special case of LLL, it performs at least as well as Babai's nearest plane algorithm (LLL-aided SIC). The former analysis helps to explain the folklore practical observation that unique SVP is easier than standard approximate SVP. It is proven that when the LLL algorithm is employed, the embedding technique can solve the CVP provided that the noise norm is smaller than a decoding radius , where is the minimum distance of the lattice, and . This substantially improves the previously best known correct decoding bound . Focusing on the applications of BDD to decoding of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, we also prove that BDD of the regularized lattice is optimal in terms of the diversity-multiplexing gain tradeoff (DMT), and propose practical variants of embedding decoding which require no knowledge of the minimum distance of the lattice and/or further improve the error performance.",

	{'abstract': u'Finding an appropriate turbulence model for a given flow case usually calls for extensive experimentation with both models and numerical solution methods. This work presents the design and implementation of a flexible, programmable software framework for assisting with numerical experiments in computational turbulence. The framework targets Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes models, discretized by finite element methods. The novel implementation makes use of Python and the FEniCS package, the combination of which leads to compact and reusable code, where model- and solver-specific code resemble closely the mathematical formulation of equations and algorithms. The presented ideas and programming techniques are also applicable to other fields that involve systems of nonlinear partial differential equations. We demonstrate the framework in two applications and investigate the impact of various linearizations on the convergence properties of nonlinear solvers for a Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes model.',

	{'abstract': u'We study the stability of a Markovian model of electricity production and consumption that incorporates production volatility due to renewables and uncertainty about actual demand versus planned production. We assume that the energy producer targets a fixed energy reserve, subject to ramp-up and ramp-down constraints, and that appliances are subject to demand-response signals and adjust their consumption to the available production by delaying their demand. When a constant fraction of the delayed demand vanishes over time, we show that the general state Markov chain characterizing the system is positive Harris and ergodic (i.e., delayed demand is bounded with high probability). However, when delayed demand increases by a constant fraction over time, we show that the Markov chain is non-positive (i.e., there exists a non-zero probability that delayed demand becomes unbounded). We exhibit Lyapunov functions to prove our claims. In addition, we provide examples of heating appliances that, when delayed, have energy requirements corresponding to the two considered cases.',

	{'abstract': u"Raz's recent result cite has rekindled people's interest in the study of emph, the generalization of matrix rank to high dimensions, by showing its connections to arithmetic formulas. In this paper, we follow Raz's work and show that emph, the monotone variant of tensor rank and matrix rank, has applications in algebraic complexity, quantum computing and communication complexity. This paper differs from Raz's paper in that it leverages existing results to show unconditional bounds while Raz's result relies on some assumptions. We show a super-exponential separation between monotone and non-monotone computation in the non-commutative model, and thus provide a strong solution to Nisan's question cite in algebraic complexity. More specifically, we exhibit that there exists a homogeneous algebraic function of degree ( even) on variables with the monotone algebraic branching program (ABP) complexity and the non-monotone ABP complexity . In Bell's theorem cite, a basic assumption is that players have free will, and under such an assumption, local hidden variable theory still cannot predict the correlations produced by quantum mechanics. Using tools from monotone rank, we show that even if we disallow the players to have free will, local hidden variable theory still cannot predict the correlations produced by quantum mechanics. We generalize the log-rank conjecture cite in communication complexity to the multiparty case, and prove that for super-polynomial parties, there is a super-polynomial separation between the deterministic communication complexity and the logarithm of the rank of the communication tensor. This means that the log-rank conjecture does not hold in high dimensions.",

	{'abstract': u'The neighbourhood function N(t) of a graph G gives, for each t, the number of pairs of nodes &lt;x, y&gt; such that y is reachable from x in less that t hops. The neighbourhood function provides a wealth of information about the graph (e.g., it easily allows one to compute its diameter), but it is very expensive to compute it exactly. Recently, the ANF algorithm (approximate neighbourhood function) has been proposed with the purpose of approximating NG(t) on large graphs. We describe a breakthrough improvement over ANF in terms of speed and scalability. Our algorithm, called HyperANF, uses the new HyperLogLog counters and combines them efficiently through broadword programming; our implementation uses overdecomposition to exploit multi-core parallelism. With HyperANF, for the first time we can compute in a few hours the neighbourhood function of graphs with billions of nodes with a small error and good confidence using a standard workstation. Then, we turn to the study of the distribution of the shortest paths between reachable nodes (that can be efficiently approximated by means of HyperANF), and discover the surprising fact that its index of dispersion provides a clear-cut characterisation of proper social networks vs. web graphs. We thus propose the spid (Shortest-Paths Index of Dispersion) of a graph as a new, informative statistics that is able to discriminate between the above two types of graphs. We believe this is the first proposal of a significant new non-local structural index for complex networks whose computation is highly scalable.',

	{'abstract': u'In this paper, we present a new approach for the analysis of iterative node-based verification-based (NB-VB) recovery algorithms in the context of compressive sensing. These algorithms are particularly interesting due to their low complexity (linear in the signal dimension ). The asymptotic analysis predicts the fraction of unverified signal elements at each iteration in the asymptotic regime where . The analysis is similar in nature to the well-known density evolution technique commonly used to analyze iterative decoding algorithms. To perform the analysis, a message-passing interpretation of NB-VB algorithms is provided. This interpretation lacks the extrinsic nature of standard message-passing algorithms to which density evolution is usually applied. This requires a number of non-trivial modifications in the analysis. The analysis tracks the average performance of the recovery algorithms over the ensembles of input signals and sensing matrices as a function of . Concentration results are devised to demonstrate that the performance of the recovery algorithms applied to any choice of the input signal over any realization of the sensing matrix follows the deterministic results of the analysis closely. Simulation results are also provided which demonstrate that the proposed asymptotic analysis matches the performance of recovery algorithms for large but finite values of . Compared to the existing technique for the analysis of NB-VB algorithms, which is based on numerically solving a large system of coupled differential equations, the proposed method is much simpler and more accurate.',

	{'abstract': u'Understanding and modelling resources of Internet end hosts is essential for the design of desktop software and Internet-distributed applications. In this paper we develop a correlated resource model of Internet end hosts based on real trace data taken from the SETI@home project. This data covers a 5-year period with statistics for 2.7 million hosts. The resource model is based on statistical analysis of host computational power, memory, and storage as well as how these resources change over time and the correlations between them. We find that resources with few discrete values (core count, memory) are well modeled by exponential laws governing the change of relative resource quantities over time. Resources with a continuous range of values are well modeled with either correlated normal distributions (processor speed for integer operations and floating point operations) or log-normal distributions (available disk space). We validate and show the utility of the models by applying them to a resource allocation problem for Internet-distributed applications, and demonstrate their value over other models. We also make our trace data and tool for automatically generating realistic Internet end hosts publicly available.',

	{'abstract': u'Inferring cluster structure in microarray datasets is a fundamental task for the -omic sciences. A fundamental question in Statistics, Data Analysis and Classification, is the prediction of the number of clusters in a dataset, usually established via internal validation measures. Despite the wealth of internal measures available in the literature, new ones have been recently proposed, some of them specifically for microarray data. In this dissertation, a study of internal validation measures is given, paying particular attention to the stability based ones. Indeed, this class of measures is particularly prominent and promising in order to have a reliable estimate the number of clusters in a dataset. For those measures, a new general algorithmic paradigm is proposed here that highlights the richness of measures in this class and accounts for the ones already available in the literature. Moreover, some of the most representative validation measures are also considered. Experiments on 12 benchmark datasets are performed in order to assess both the intrinsic ability of a measure to predict the correct number of clusters in a dataset and its merit relative to the other measures. The main result is a hierarchy of internal validation measures in terms of precision and speed, highlighting some of their merits and limitations not reported before in the literature. This hierarchy shows that the faster the measure, the less accurate it is. In order to reduce the time performance gap between the fastest and the most precise measures, the technique of designing fast approximation algorithms is systematically applied. The end result is a speed-up of many of the measures studied here that brings the gap between the fastest and the most precise within one order of magnitude in time, with no degradation in their prediction power. Prior to this work, the time gap was at least two orders of magnitude.',

	{'abstract': u'A protocol for computing a functionality is secure if an adversary in this protocol cannot cause more harm than in an ideal computation where parties give their inputs to a trusted party which returns the output of the functionality to all parties. In particular, in the ideal model such computation is fair -- all parties get the output. Cleve (STOC 1986) proved that, in general, fairness is not possible without an honest majority. To overcome this impossibility, Gordon and Katz (Eurocrypt 2010) suggested a relaxed definition -- 1/p-secure computation -- which guarantees partial fairness. For two parties, they construct 1/p-secure protocols for functionalities for which the size of either their domain or their range is polynomial (in the security parameter). Gordon and Katz ask whether their results can be extended to multiparty protocols. We study 1/p-secure protocols in the multiparty setting for general functionalities. Our main result is constructions of 1/p-secure protocols when the number of parties is constant provided that less than 2/3 of the parties are corrupt. Our protocols require that either (1) the functionality is deterministic and the size of the domain is polynomial (in the security parameter), or (2) the functionality can be randomized and the size of the range is polynomial. If the size of the domain is constant and the functionality is deterministic, then our protocol is efficient even when the number of parties is O(log log n) (where n is the security parameter). On the negative side, we show that when the number of parties is super-constant, 1/p-secure protocols are not possible when the size of the domain is polynomial.',

	{'abstract': u"We consider the problem of performing a random walk in a distributed network. Given bandwidth constraints, the goal of the problem is to minimize the number of rounds required to obtain a random walk sample. Das Sarma et al. [PODC'10] show that a random walk of length on a network of diameter can be performed in time. A major question left open is whether there exists a faster algorithm, especially whether the multiplication of and is necessary. In this paper, we show a tight unconditional lower bound on the time complexity of distributed random walk computation. Specifically, we show that for any , , and , performing a random walk of length on an -node network of diameter requires time. This bound is , i.e., it holds for any (possibly randomized) algorithm. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first lower bound that the diameter plays a role of multiplicative factor. Our bound shows that the algorithm of Das Sarma et al. is time optimal. Our proof technique introduces a new connection between communication complexity and distributed algorithm lower bounds with as a trade-off parameter, strengthening the previous study by Das Sarma et al.

	{'abstract': u'Interference is emerging as a fundamental bottleneck in many important wireless communication scenarios, including dense cellular networks and cognitive networks with spectrum sharing by multiple service providers. Although multipleantenna (MIMO) signal processing is known to offer useful degrees of freedom to cancel interference, extreme-value theoretic analysis recently showed that, even in the absence of MIMO processing, the scaling law of the capacity in the number of users for a multi-cell network with and without inter-cell interference was asymptotically identical provided a simple signal to noise and interference ratio (SINR) maximizing scheduler is exploited. This suggests that scheduling can help reduce inter-cell interference substantially, thus possibly limiting the need for multiple-antenna processing. However, the convergence limits of interference after scheduling in a multi-cell setting are not yet identified. In this paper1 we analyze such limits theoretically. We consider channel statistics under Rayleigh fading with equal path loss for all users or with unequal path loss. We uncover two surprisingly different behaviors for such systems. For the equal path loss case, we show that scheduling alone can cause the residual interference to converge to zero for large number of users. With unequal path loss however, the interference are shown to converge in average to a nonzero constant. Simulations back our findings.',

	{'abstract': u'We define the notion of affine rigidity of a hypergraph and prove a variety of fundamental results for this notion. First, we show that affine rigidity can be determined by the rank of a specific matrix which implies that affine rigidity is a generic property of the hypergraph.Then we prove that if a graph is is -vertex-connected, then it must be "generically neighborhood affinely rigid" in -dimensional space. This implies that if a graph is -vertex-connected then any generic framework of its squared graph must be universally rigid. Our results, and affine rigidity more generally, have natural applications in point registration and localization, as well as connections to manifold learning.',

	{'abstract': u"We present new and improved data structures that answer exact node-to-node distance queries in planar graphs. Such data structures are also known as distance oracles. For any directed planar graph on n nodes with non-negative lengths we obtain the following: * Given a desired space allocation , we show how to construct in time a data structure of size that answers distance queries in time per query. As a consequence, we obtain an improvement over the fastest algorithm for k-many distances in planar graphs whenever . * We provide a linear-space exact distance oracle for planar graphs with query time for any constant eps&gt;0. This is the first such data structure with provable sublinear query time. * For edge lengths at least one, we provide an exact distance oracle of space such that for any pair of nodes at distance D the query time is . Comparable query performance had been observed experimentally but has never been explained theoretically. Our data structures are based on the following new tool: given a non-self-crossing cycle C with nodes, we can preprocess G in time to produce a data structure of size that can answer the following queries in time: for a query node u, output the distance from u to all the nodes of C. This data structure builds on and extends a related data structure of Klein (SODA'05), which reports distances to the boundary of a face, rather than a cycle. The best distance oracles for planar graphs until the current work are due to Cabello (SODA'06), Djidjev (WG'96), and Fakcharoenphol and Rao (FOCS'01).

	{'abstract': u'In this paper, we give a theoretical analysis for the algorithms to compute functional decomposition for multivariate polynomials based on differentiation and homogenization which are proposed by Ye, Dai, Lam (1999) and Faugere, Perret (2006, 2008, 2009). We show that a degree proper functional decomposition for a set of randomly decomposable quartic homogenous polynomials can be computed using the algorithm with high probability. This solves a conjecture proposed by Ye, Dai, and Lam (1999). We also propose a conjecture such that the decomposition for a set of polynomials can be computed from that of its homogenization with high probability. Finally, we prove that the right decomposition factors for a set of polynomials can be computed from its right decomposition factor space. Combining these results together, we prove that the algorithm can compute a degree proper decomposition for a set of randomly decomposable quartic polynomials with probability one when the base field is of characteristic zero, and with probability close to one when the base field is a finite field with sufficiently large number under the assumption that the conjeture is correct.',

	{'abstract': u'Sampling rate is the bottleneck for spectrum sensing over multi-GHz bandwidth. Recent progress in compressed sensing (CS) initialized several sub-Nyquist rate approaches to overcome the problem. However, efforts to design CS reconstruction algorithms for wideband spectrum sensing are very limited. It is possible to further reduce the sampling rate requirement and improve reconstruction performance via algorithms considering prior knowledge of cognitive radio spectrum usages. In this paper, we group the usages of cognitive radio spectrum into three categories and propose a modified orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) algorithm for wideband spectrum sensing. Simulation results show that this modified OMP algorithm outperforms two modified basis pursuit de-noising (BPDN) algorithms in terms of reconstruction performance and computation time.',

	{'abstract': u'In this paper we study stochastic dynamic games with many players; these are a fundamental model for a wide range of economic applications. The standard solution concept for such games is Markov perfect equilibrium (MPE), but it is well known that MPE computation becomes intractable as the number of players increases. We instead consider the notion of stationary equilibrium (SE), where players optimize assuming the empirical distribution of others\' states remains constant at its long run average. We make two main contributions. First, we provide a rigorous justification for using SE. In particular, we provide a parsimonious collection of exogenous conditions over model primitives that guarantee existence of SE, and ensure that an appropriate approximation property to MPE holds, in a general model with possibly unbounded state spaces. Second, we draw a significant connection between the validity of SE, and market structure: under the same conditions that imply SE exist and approximates MPE well, the market becomes fragmented in the limit of many firms. To illustrate this connection, we study in detail a series of dynamic oligopoly examples. These examples show that our conditions enforce a form of "decreasing returns to larger states"; this yields fragmented industries in the limit. By contrast, violation of these conditions suggests "increasing returns to larger states" and potential market concentration. In that sense, our work uses a fully dynamic framework to also contribute to a longstanding issue in industrial organization: understanding the determinants of market structure in different industries.',

	{'abstract': u'We report new results on the complexity of the valued constraint satisfaction problem (VCSP). Under the unique games conjecture, the approximability of finite-valued VCSP is fairly well-understood. However, there is yet no characterisation of VCSPs that can be solved exactly in polynomial time. This is unsatisfactory, since such results are interesting from a combinatorial optimisation perspective; there are deep connections with, for instance, submodular and bisubmodular minimisation. We consider the Min and Max CSP problems (i.e. where the cost functions only attain values in ) over four-element domains and identify all tractable fragments. Similar classifications were previously known for two- and three-element domains. In the process, we introduce a new class of tractable VCSPs based on a generalisation of submodularity. We also extend and modify a graph-based technique by Kolmogorov and Zivny (originally introduced by Takhanov) for efficiently obtaining hardness results in our setting. This allow us to prove the result without relying on computer-assisted case analyses (which otherwise are fairly common when studying the complexity and approximability of VCSPs.) The hardness results are further simplified by the introduction of powerful reduction techniques.',

The capacity region is shown to be strictly larger in general than the achievable rate regions when treating interference as noise, using successive interference cancellation decoding, and using joint decoding. The gains in coverage and achievable rate using the optimal decoder are analyzed in terms of ensemble averages using stochastic geometry. In a spatial network where the nodes are distributed according to a Poisson point process and the channel path loss exponent is , it is shown that the density of users that can be supported by treating interference as noise can scale no faster than as the bandwidth grows, while the density of users can scale linearly with under optimal decoding.',

A processing grid network is proposed to underlie not just matter and energy, but also space and time. The suggested "screen" for our familiar three dimensional world is a hyper-sphere surface simulated by a grid network. Light and matter then travel, or are transmitted, in the "directions" of the grid architecture. The processing sequences of grid nodes create time, as the static states of movies run together emulate events. Yet here what exists are not the static states, but the dynamic processing between them. Quantum collapse is the irreversible event that gives time its direction. In this model, empty space is null processing, directions are node links, time is processing cycles, light is a processing wave, objects are wave tangles and energy is the processing transfer rate. It describes a world where empty space is not empty, space warps, time dilates, and everything began when this virtual universe "booted up".',

	{'abstract': u'We consider spatially coupled code ensembles over a multiple access channel. Convolutional LDPC ensembles are one instance of spatially coupled codes. It was shown recently that, for transmission over the binary erasure channel, this coupling of individual code ensembles has the effect of increasing the belief propagation threshold of the coupled ensembles to the maximum a-posteriori threshold of the underlying ensemble. In this sense, spatially coupled codes were shown to be capacity achieving. It was observed, empirically, that these codes are universal in the sense that they achieve performance close to the Shannon threshold for any general binary-input memoryless symmetric channels. In this work we provide further evidence of the threshold saturation phenomena when transmitting over a class of multiple access channel. We show, by density evolution analysis and EXIT curves, that the belief propagation threshold of the coupled ensembles is very close to the ultimate Shannon limit.',

	{'abstract': u'In this paper, we consider different aspects of the network functional compression problem where computation of a function (or, some functions) of sources located at certain nodes in a network is desired at receiver(s). The rate region of this problem has been considered in the literature under certain restrictive assumptions, particularly in terms of the network topology, the functions and the characteristics of the sources. In this paper, we present results that significantly relax these assumptions. Firstly, we consider this problem for an arbitrary tree network and asymptotically lossless computation. We show that, for depth one trees with correlated sources, or for general trees with independent sources, a modularized coding scheme based on graph colorings and Slepian-Wolf compression performs arbitrarily closely to rate lower bounds. For a general tree network with independent sources, optimal computation to be performed at intermediate nodes is derived. We introduce a necessary and sufficient condition on graph colorings of any achievable coding scheme, called coloring connectivity condition (C.C.C.). Secondly, we investigate the effect of having several functions at the receiver. In this problem, we derive a rate region and propose a coding scheme based on graph colorings. Thirdly, we consider the functional compression problem with feedback. We show that, in this problem, unlike Slepian-Wolf compression, by having feedback, one may outperform rate bounds of the case without feedback. Fourthly, we investigate functional computation problem with distortion. We compute a rate-distortion region for this problem. Then, we propose a simple suboptimal coding scheme with a non-trivial performance guarantee. Finally, we introduce cases where finding minimum entropy colorings and therefore, optimal coding schemes can be performed in polynomial time.',

	{'abstract': u'Spectrum sensing is the major challenge in the cognitive radio (CR). We propose to learn local feature and use it as the prior knowledge to improve the detection performance. We define the local feature as the leading eigenvector derived from the received signal samples. A feature learning algorithm (FLA) is proposed to learn the feature blindly. Then, with local feature as the prior knowledge, we propose the feature template matching algorithm (FTM) for spectrum sensing. We use the discrete Karhunen--Love transform (DKLT) to show that such a feature is robust against noise and has maximum effective signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Captured real-world data shows that the learned feature is very stable over time. It is almost unchanged in 25 seconds. Then, we test the detection performance of the FTM in very low SNR. Simulation results show that the FTM is about 2 dB better than the blind algorithms, and the FTM does not have the noise uncertainty problem.',

	{'abstract': u'Optimum implementation of non-conventional wells allows us to increase considerably hydrocarbon recovery. By considering the high drilling cost and the potential improvement in well productivity, well placement decision is an important issue in field development. Considering complex reservoir geology and high reservoir heterogeneities, stochastic optimization methods are the most suitable approaches for optimum well placement. This paper proposes an optimization methodology to determine optimal well location and trajectory based upon the Covariance Matrix Adaptation - Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES) which is a variant of Evolution Strategies recognized as one of the most powerful derivative-free optimizers for continuous optimization. To improve the optimization procedure, two new techniques are investigated: (1). Adaptive penalization with rejection is developed to handle well placement constraints. (2). A meta-model, based on locally weighted regression, is incorporated into CMA-ES using an approximate ranking procedure. Therefore, we can reduce the number of reservoir simulations, which are computationally expensive. Several examples are presented. Our new approach is compared with a Genetic Algorithm incorporating the Genocop III technique. It is shown that our approach outperforms the genetic algorithm: it leads in general to both a higher NPV and a significant reduction of the number of reservoir simulations.',

	{'abstract': u'The problem of universally predicting an individual continuous sequence using a deterministic finite-state machine (FSM) is considered. The empirical mean is used as a reference as it is the constant that fits a given sequence within a minimal square error. With this reference, a reasonable prediction performance is the regret, namely the excess square-error over the reference loss, the empirical variance. The paper analyzes the tradeoff between the number of states of the universal FSM and the attainable regret. It first studies the case of a small number of states. A class of machines, denoted Degenerated Tracking Memory (DTM), is defined and the optimal machine in this class is shown to be the optimal among all machines for small enough number of states. Unfortunately, DTM machines become suboptimal as the number of available states increases. Next, the Exponential Decaying Memory (EDM) machine, previously used for predicting binary sequences, is considered. While this machine has poorer performance for small number of states, it achieves a vanishing regret for large number of states. Following that, an asymptotic lower bound of O(k^) on the achievable regret of any k-state machine is derived. This bound is attained asymptotically by the EDM machine. Furthermore, a new machine, denoted the Enhanced Exponential Decaying Memory machine, is shown to outperform the EDM machine for any number of states.',

It describes the properties of linguistic networks built using texts of written language with the words randomized. These properties are compared to those obtained for a network built over the text in natural order. It is observed that the "random" networks too exhibit small-world and scale-free characteristics. They also show a high degree of clustering. This is indeed a surprising result - one that has not been addressed adequately in the literature. We hypothesize that many of the network statistics reported here studied are in fact functions of the distribution of the underlying data from which the network is built and may not be indicative of the nature of the concerned network.',

	{'abstract': u'The question of what can be computed, and how efficiently, are at the core of computer science. Not surprisingly, in distributed systems and networking research, an equally fundamental question is what can be computed in a distributed fashion. More precisely, if nodes of a network must base their decision on information in their local neighborhood only, how well can they compute or approximate a global (optimization) problem? In this paper we give the first substantial lower bound on such local computation for (optimization) problems including minimum vertex cover, minimum (connected) dominating set, maximum matching, maximal independent set, and maximal matching. In addition we present a new distributed algorithm for solving general covering and packing linear programs. For some problems this algorithm is tight with the lower bounds, for others it is a distributed approximation scheme. Together, our lower and upper bounds establish the local computability and approximability of a large class of problems, characterizing how much local information is required to solve these tasks.',

	{'abstract': u'We present a multi-channel P2P Video-on-Demand (VoD) system using "plug-and-play" helpers. Helpers are heterogenous "micro-servers" with limited storage, bandwidth and number of users they can serve simultaneously. Our proposed system has the following salient features: (1) it minimizes the server load; (2) it is distributed, and requires little or no maintenance overhead and which can easily adapt to system dynamics; and (3) it is adaptable to varying supply and demand patterns across multiple video channels irrespective of video popularity. Our proposed solution jointly optimizes over helper-user topology, video storage allocation and bandwidth allocation. The combinatorial nature of the problem and the system demand for distributed algorithms makes the problem uniquely challenging. By utilizing Lagrangian decomposition and Markov chain approximation based arguments, we address this challenge by designing two distributed algorithms running in tandem: a primal-dual storage and bandwidth allocation algorithm and a "soft-worst-neighbor-choking" topology-building algorithm. Our scheme provably converges to a near-optimal solution, and is easy to implement in practice. Simulation results validate that the proposed scheme achieves minimum sever load under highly heterogeneous combinations of supply and demand patterns, and is robust to system dynamics of user/helper churn, user/helper asynchrony, and random delays in the network.',

	{'abstract': u'Ordinal regression is commonly formulated as a multi-class problem with ordinal constraints. The challenge of designing accurate classifiers for ordinal regression generally increases with the number of classes involved, due to the large number of labeled patterns that are needed. The availability of ordinal class labels, however, is often costly to calibrate or difficult to obtain. Unlabeled patterns, on the other hand, often exist in much greater abundance and are freely available. To take benefits from the abundance of unlabeled patterns, we present a novel transductive learning paradigm for ordinal regression in this paper, namely Transductive Ordinal Regression (TOR). The key challenge of the present study lies in the precise estimation of both the ordinal class label of the unlabeled data and the decision functions of the ordinal classes, simultaneously. The core elements of the proposed TOR include an objective function that caters to several commonly used loss functions casted in transductive settings, for general ordinal regression. A label swapping scheme that facilitates a strictly monotonic decrease in the objective function value is also introduced. Extensive numerical studies on commonly used benchmark datasets including the real world sentiment prediction problem are then presented to showcase the characteristics and efficacies of the proposed transductive ordinal regression. Further, comparisons to recent state-of-the-art ordinal regression methods demonstrate the introduced transductive learning paradigm for ordinal regression led to the robust and improved performance.',

	{'abstract': u'We present an empirical study of user activity in online BBC discussion forums, measured by the number of posts written by individual debaters and the average sentiment of these posts. Nearly 2.5 million posts from over 18 thousand users were investigated. Scale free distributions were observed for activity in individual discussion threads as well as for overall activity. The number of unique users in a thread normalized by the thread length decays with thread length, suggesting that thread life is sustained by mutual discussions rather than by independent comments. Automatic sentiment analysis shows that most posts contain negative emotions and the most active users in individual threads express predominantly negative sentiments. It follows that the average emotion of longer threads is more negative and that threads can be sustained by negative comments. An agent based computer simulation model has been used to reproduce several essential characteristics of the analyzed system. The model stresses the role of discussions between users, especially emotionally laden quarrels between supporters of opposite opinions, and represents many observed statistics of the forum.',

We add a redundancy to the original image by mapping the transform coefficients with small amplitudes to zero and the resultant sparsity pattern is used as the side information in the recovery stage. If the side information is not available, the receiver has to estimate the sparsity pattern. At the end, the recovery is done by consecutive projecting between two spatial and transform sets.

	{'abstract': u'Security aspects of the Index Coding with Side Information (ICSI) problem are investigated. Building on the results of Bar-Yossef et al. (2006), the properties of linear index codes are further explored. The notion of weak security, considered by Bhattad and Narayanan (2005) in the context of network coding, is generalized to block security. It is shown that the linear index code based on a matrix , whose column space code has length , minimum distance and dual distance , is -block secure (and hence also weakly secure) if the adversary knows in advance messages, and is completely insecure if the adversary knows in advance more than messages. Strong security is examined under the conditions that the adversary: (i) possesses messages in advance; (ii) eavesdrops at most transmissions; (iii) corrupts at most transmissions. We prove that for sufficiently large , an optimal linear index code which is strongly secure against such an adversary has length . Here is a generalization of the min-rank over of the side information graph for the ICSI problem in its original formulation in the work of Bar- Yossef et al.',

	{'abstract': u'We analyze the effect of interference on the convergence rate of average consensus algorithms, which iteratively compute the measurement average by message passing among nodes. It is usually assumed that these algorithms converge faster with a greater exchange of information (i.e., by increased network connectivity) in every iteration. However, when interference is taken into account, it is no longer clear if the rate of convergence increases with network connectivity. We study this problem for randomly-placed consensus-seeking nodes connected through an interference-limited network. We investigate the following questions: (a) How does the rate of convergence vary with increasing communication range of each node? and (b) How does this result change when each node is allowed to communicate with a few selected far-off nodes? When nodes schedule their transmissions to avoid interference, we show that the convergence speed scales with , where is the communication range and is the number of dimensions. This scaling is the result of two competing effects when increasing : Increased schedule length for interference-free transmission vs. the speed gain due to improved connectivity. Hence, although one-dimensional networks can converge faster from a greater communication range despite increased interference, the two effects exactly offset one another in two-dimensions. In higher dimensions, increasing the communication range can actually degrade the rate of convergence. Our results thus underline the importance of factoring in the effect of interference in the design of distributed estimation algorithms.',

Comparing to the approximations by fuzzy system and radial-based-function (RBF) neural networks, the presented two methods can not only approximate universally the uncertainties, but also estimate the unknown states. Moreover, the integral-chain differentiator can restrain noises thoroughly. The theoretical results are confirmed by computer simulations for feedback control.',

	{'abstract': u'We consider the localization problem of multiple wideband sources in a multi-path environment by coherently taking into account the attenuation characteristics and the time delays in the reception of the signal. Our proposed method leaves the space for unavailability of an accurate signal attenuation model in the environment by considering the model as an unknown function with reasonable prior assumptions about its functional space. Such approach is capable of enhancing the localization performance compared to only utilizing the signal attenuation information or the time delays. In this paper, the localization problem is modeled as a cost function in terms of the source locations, attenuation model parameters and the multi-path parameters. To globally perform the minimization, we propose a hybrid algorithm combining the differential evolution algorithm with the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm. Besides the proposed combination of optimization schemes, supporting the technical details such as closed forms of cost function sensitivity matrices are provided. Finally, the validity of the proposed method is examined in several localization scenarios, taking into account the noise in the environment, the multi-path phenomenon and considering the sensors not being synchronized.',

This type of synchronisation may occur when people need only some awareness about the location of others within the specific context of an on-going activity. We have identified a number of reference scenarios for this type of synchronisation and we have implemented and deployed a prototype to evaluate the type of support provided. The results of the evaluation suggest a good acceptance of the overall concept, indicating that this might be a valuable approach for many of the indicated scenarios, possibly replacing or complementing existing synchronisation practices.',

	{'abstract': u"Algebraic independence is an advanced notion in commutative algebra that generalizes independence of linear polynomials to higher degree. Polynomials subset F[x_1, ..., x_n] are called algebraically independent if there is no non-zero polynomial F such that F(f_1, ..., f_m) = 0. The transcendence degree, trdeg, is the maximal number r of algebraically independent polynomials in the set. In this paper we design blackbox and efficient linear maps phi that reduce the number of variables from n to r but maintain trdeg_i = r, assuming f_i's sparse and small r. We apply these fundamental maps to solve several cases of blackbox identity testing: (1) Given a polynomial-degree circuit C and sparse polynomials f_1, ..., f_m with trdeg r, we can test blackbox D := C(f_1, ..., f_m) for zeroness in poly(size(D))^r time. (2) Define a spsp_ delta(k,s,n) circuit C to be of the form sum_^k prod_^s f_, where f_ are sparse n-variate polynomials of degree at most delta. For k = 2 we give a poly(sn delta)^ time blackbox identity test. (3) For a general depth-4 circuit we define a notion of rank. Assuming there is a rank bound R for minimal simple spsp_ delta(k,s,n) identities, we give a poly(snR delta)^ time blackbox identity test for spsp_ delta(k,s,n) circuits. This partially generalizes the state of the art of depth-3 to depth-4 circuits. The notion of trdeg works best with large or zero characteristic, but we also give versions of our results for arbitrary fields.",

	{'abstract': u'We continue the line of research on graph compression started with WebGraph, but we move our focus to the compression of social networks in a proper sense (e.g., LiveJournal): the approaches that have been used for a long time to compress web graphs rely on a specific ordering of the nodes (lexicographical URL ordering) whose extension to general social networks is not trivial. In this paper, we propose a solution that mixes clusterings and orders, and devise a new algorithm, called Layered Label Propagation, that builds on previous work on scalable clustering and can be used to reorder very large graphs (billions of nodes). Our implementation uses overdecomposition to perform aggressively on multi-core architecture, making it possible to reorder graphs of more than 600 millions nodes in a few hours. Experiments performed on a wide array of web graphs and social networks show that combining the order produced by the proposed algorithm with the WebGraph compression framework provides a major increase in compression with respect to all currently known techniques, both on web graphs and on social networks. These improvements make it possible to analyse in main memory significantly larger graphs.',

	{'abstract': u"A network where three users communicate with each other via a relay is considered. Users do not receive other users' signals via a direct link, and thus the relay is essential for their communication. Each user is assumed to have an individual message to be delivered to each other user. Thus, each user wants to send two messages and to decode two messages. In general, the transmit signals of different nodes can be dependent since they can depend on previously received symbols. We call this case the general case. The sum-capacity is studied, and upper bounds and lower bounds are given. If all nodes have the same power, the sum-capacity is characterized to within a gap of 5/2 bits or a factor of 3 for all values of channel coefficients. This gap is also shown to approach 3/2 bits as the transmit power increases. Moreover, for the symmetric case with equal channel coefficients, the gap is shown to be less than 1 bit. The restricted case is also considered where the transmit signal does not depend on previously received symbols. In this case, the sum-capacity is characterized to within a gap of 2 bits or a factor of 3 for all values of channel coefficients, and approaches 1 bit as the transmit power increases.",

	{'abstract': u"In this paper, we present and analyze the properties of a new class of games - the spatial congestion game (SCG), which is a generalization of the classical congestion game (CG). In a classical congestion game, multiple users share the same set of resources and a user's payoff for using any resource is a function of the total number of users sharing it. As a potential game, this game enjoys some very appealing properties, including the existence of a pure strategy Nash equilibrium (NE) and that every improvement path is finite and leads to such a NE (also called the finite improvement property or FIP). While it's tempting to use this model to study spectrum sharing, it does not capture the spatial reuse feature of wireless communication, where resources (interpreted as channels) may be reused without increasing congestion provided that users are located far away from each other. This motivates us to study an extended form of the congestion game where a user's payoff for using a resource is a function of the number of its interfering users sharing it. This naturally results in a spatial congestion game (SCG), where users are placed over a network (or a conflict graph). We study fundamental properties of a spatial congestion game; in particular, we seek to answer under what conditions this game possesses the finite improvement property or a Nash equilibrium. We also discuss the implications of these results when applied to wireless spectrum sharing.",

A polynomial time algorithm for the isomorphism problem for regular linear orders (and even regular words, which generalize the latter) given by DFAs is presented. This solves an open problem by Esik and Bloom.',

	{'abstract': u'Modern Avionics are controlled by sophisticated mission components in the Aircraft. The control function is implemented via a standard ARINC-429 bus interface. It is a two-wire point-topoint serial data bus for control communications in Avionics. The bus operates 12.5 or 100kb/sec, the implementation is envisaged for one transmits and receive channel respectively. Further the code can be modified for more no of independent Tx and Rx channels. An on chip memory allotment on the FPGA will provide a buffer bank for storing the incoming or outgoing data. For this purpose SRAM based FPGAs are utilized. This flexible ARINC429 solution gives exactly what is needed for real time applications. The IP can be programmed to send an interrupt to the host and also prepare it to process the data. Majority of the hardware function of digital natures are embedded into a single FPGA by saving in terms of PCB board space, power consumption and volume results. This paper deals with the development, implementation, simulation, and verification of ARINC_429 formats. The IP core development is described in VHDL.',

	{'abstract': u'In this paper, we study the achievable rate region of Gaussian multiuser channels with the messages transmitted being from finite input alphabets and the outputs being . In particular, we focus on the achievable rate region of Gaussian broadcast channel (GBC) and Gaussian multiple access channel (GMAC). First, we study the achievable rate region of two-user GBC when the messages to be transmitted to both the users take values from finite signal sets and the received signal is quantized at both the users. We refer to this channel as . We observe that the capacity region defined for a GBC does not carry over as such to QBC. We show that the optimal decoding scheme for GBC (i.e., high SNR user doing successive decoding and low SNR user decoding its message alone) is not optimal for QBC. We then propose an achievable rate region for QBC based on two different schemes. We present achievable rate region results for the case of uniform quantization at the receivers. Next, we investigate the achievable rate region of two-user GMAC with finite input alphabet and quantized receiver output. We refer to this channel as . We derive expressions for the achievable rate region of a two-user QMAC. We show that, with finite input alphabet, the achievable rate region with the commonly used uniform receiver quantizer has a significant loss compared to the achievable rate region without receiver quantization. We propose a which has a significantly larger rate region compared to what is achieved with a uniform quantizer in QMAC.',

	{'abstract': u'Bit-interleaved coded modulation (BICM) using (bi-)orthogonal signals is especially well suited for the application in impulse-radio ultra-wideband transmission systems, which typically operate in the power-limited regime and require a very low-complexity transmitter and receiver design. In this paper we analyze the capacity of BICM using (bi-)orthogonal signals with coherent and noncoherent detection and put particular focus on the power-limited or wideband regime. We give analytical expressions for the ratio energy per bit vs. noise power spectral density in the limit of infinite bandwidth and the respective wideband slope, and thus, are able to quantify the loss incurred by the restriction to BICM in contrast to coded modulation. The gained theoretical insights allow to derive design rules for impulse-radio ultra-wideband transmission systems.',

	{'abstract': u'Graph coloring, also known as vertex coloring, considers the problem of assigning colors to the nodes of a graph such that adjacent nodes do not share the same color. The optimization version of the problem concerns the minimization of the number of used colors. In this paper we deal with the problem of finding valid colorings of graphs in a distributed way, that is, by means of an algorithm that only uses local information for deciding the color of the nodes. Such algorithms prescind from any central control. Due to the fact that quite a few practical applications require to find colorings in a distributed way, the interest in distributed algorithms for graph coloring has been growing during the last decade. As an example consider wireless ad-hoc and sensor networks, where tasks such as the assignment of frequencies or the assignment of TDMA slots are strongly related to graph coloring. The algorithm proposed in this paper is inspired by the calling behavior of Japanese tree frogs. Male frogs use their calls to attract females. Interestingly, groups of males that are located nearby each other desynchronize their calls. This is because female frogs are only able to correctly localize the male frogs when their calls are not too close in time. We experimentally show that our algorithm is very competitive with the current state of the art, using different sets of problem instances and comparing to one of the most competitive algorithms from the literature.',

	{'abstract': u'In this paper, we propose a novel age estimation method based on GLOH feature descriptor and multi-task learning (MTL). The GLOH feature descriptor, one of the state-of-the-art feature descriptor, is used to capture the age-related local and spatial information of face image. As the exacted GLOH features are often redundant, MTL is designed to select the most informative feature bins for age estimation problem, while the corresponding weights are determined by ridge regression. This approach largely reduces the dimensions of feature, which can not only improve performance but also decrease the computational burden. Experiments on the public available FG-NET database show that the proposed method can achieve comparable performance over previous approaches while using much fewer features.',

Commercial involvement has created the initial garbage collector, added several interfaces and two development tools: PlDoc (a literate programming documentation system) and PlUnit (a unit testing environment). In this article we present SWI-Prolog as an integrating tool, supporting a wide range of ideas developed in the Prolog community and acting as glue between textit resources. This article itself is the glue between technical articles on SWI-Prolog, providing context and experience in applying them over a longer period.',

	{'abstract': u'Inspired by biological vision systems, the over-complete local features with huge cardinality are increasingly used for face recognition during the last decades. Accordingly, feature selection has become more and more important and plays a critical role for face data description and recognition. In this paper, we propose a trainable feature selection algorithm based on the regularized frame for face recognition. By enforcing a sparsity penalty term on the minimum squared error (MSE) criterion, we cast the feature selection problem into a combinatorial sparse approximation problem, which can be solved by greedy methods or convex relaxation methods. Moreover, based on the same frame, we propose a sparse Ho-Kashyap (HK) procedure to obtain simultaneously the optimal sparse solution and the corresponding margin vector of the MSE criterion. The proposed methods are used for selecting the most informative Gabor features of face images for recognition and the experimental results on benchmark face databases demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.',

	{'abstract': u"A critical need in Mobile Wireless Sensor Network (MWSN) is to achieve energy efficiency during routing as the sensor nodes have scarce energy resource. The nodes' mobility in MWSN poses a challenge to design an energy efficient routing protocol. Clustering helps to achieve energy efficiency by reducing the organization complexity overhead of the network which is proportional to the number of nodes in the network. This paper proposes a novel hybrid multipath routing algorithm with an efficient clustering technique. A node is selected as cluster head if it has high surplus energy, better transmission range and least mobility. The Energy Aware (EA) selection mechanism and the Maximal Nodal Surplus Energy estimation technique incorporated in this algorithm improves the energy performance during routing. Simulation results can show that the proposed clustering and routing algorithm can scale well in dynamic and energy deficient mobile sensor network.",

We assume that the person specific models share a common subset of features and novelly reformulated the common subset selection problem as a simultaneous sparse approximation problem.

	{'abstract': u'This study is focused on the development of the cortex-like visual object recognition system. We propose a general framework, which consists of three hierarchical levels (modules). These modules functionally correspond to the V1, V4 and IT areas. Both bottom-up and top-down connections between the hierarchical levels V4 and IT are employed. The higher the degree of matching between the input and the preferred stimulus, the shorter the response time of the neuron. Therefore information about a single stimulus is distributed in time and is transmitted by the waves of spikes. The reciprocal connections and waves of spikes implement predictive coding: an initial hypothesis is generated on the basis of information delivered by the first wave of spikes and is tested with the information carried by the consecutive waves. The development is considered as extraction and accumulation of features in V4 and objects in IT. Once stored a feature can be disposed, if rarely activated. This cause update of feature repository. Consequently, objects in IT are also updated. This illustrates the growing process and dynamical change of topological structures of V4, IT and connections between these areas.',

	{'abstract': u'The constraint complexity of a graphical realization of a linear code is the maximum dimension of the local constraint codes in the realization. The treewidth of a linear code is the least constraint complexity of any of its cycle-free graphical realizations. This notion provides a useful parametrization of the maximum-likelihood decoding complexity for linear codes. In this paper, we prove the surprising fact that for maximum distance separable codes and Reed-Muller codes, treewidth equals trelliswidth, which, for a code, is defined to be the least constraint complexity (or branch complexity) of any of its trellis realizations. From this, we obtain exact expressions for the treewidth of these codes, which constitute the only known explicit expressions for the treewidth of algebraic codes.',

	{'abstract': u'We analyze the performance of CSMA in multi-channel wireless networks, accounting for the random nature of traffic. Specifically, we assess the ability of CSMA to fully utilize the radio resources and in turn to stabilize the network in a dynamic setting with flow arrivals and departures. We prove that CSMA is optimal in ad-hoc mode but not in infrastructure mode, when all data flows originate from or are destined to some access points, due to the inherent bias of CSMA against downlink traffic. We propose a slight modification of CSMA, that we refer to as flow-aware CSMA, which corrects this bias and makes the algorithm optimal in all cases. The analysis is based on some time-scale separation assumption which is proved valid in the limit of large flow sizes.',

	{'abstract': u'We show that the optimal decision policy for several types of Bayesian sequential detection problems has a threshold switching curve structure on the space of posterior distributions. This is established by using lattice programming and stochastic orders in a partially observed Markov decision process (POMDP) framework. A stochastic gradient algorithm is presented to estimate the optimal linear approximation to this threshold curve. We illustrate these results by first considering quickest time detection with phase-type distributed change time and a variance stopping penalty. Then it is proved that the threshold switching curve also arises in several other Bayesian decision problems such as quickest transient detection, exponential delay (risk-sensitive) penalties, stopping time problems in social learning, and multi-agent scheduling in a changing world. Using Blackwell dominance, it is shown that for dynamic decision making problems, the optimal decision policy is lower bounded by a myopic policy. Finally, it is shown how the achievable cost of the optimal decision policy varies with change time distribution by imposing a partial order on transition matrices.',

	{'abstract': u'This paper addresses the problem of blind separation of convolutive mixtures of BPSK and circular linearly modulated signals with unknown (and possibly different) baud rates and carrier frequencies. In previous works, we established that the Constant Modulus Algorithm (CMA) is able to extract a source from a convolutive mixture of circular linearly modulated signals. We extend the analysis of the extraction capabilities of the CMA when the mixing also contains BPSK signals. We prove that if the various source signals do not share any non zero cyclic frequency nor any non conjugate cyclic frequencies, the local minima of the constant modulus cost function are separating filters. Unfortunately, the minimization of the Godard cost function generally fails when considering BPSK signals that have the same rates and the same carrier frequencies. This failure is due to the existence of non-separating local minima of the Godard cost function. In order to achieve the separation, we propose a simple modification of the Godard cost function which only requires knowledge of the BPSK sources frequency offsets at the receiver side. We provide various simulations of realistic digital communications scenarios that support our theoretical statements.',

	{'abstract': u'Secure distance bounding (DB) protocols allow one entity, the verifier, to securely obtain an upper-bound on the distance to another entity, the prover. Thus far, DB was considered mostly in the context of a single prover and a single verifier. There has been no substantial prior work on secure DB in group settings, where a set of provers interact with a set of verifiers. The need for group distance bounding (GDB) is motivated by many practical scenarios, including: group device pairing, location-based access control and secure distributed localization. GDB is also useful in mission-critical networks and automotive computer systems. This paper addresses, for the first time, GDB protocols by utilizing the new passive DB primitive and the novel mutual multi-party GDB protocol. We show how they can be used to construct secure and efficient GDB protocols for various settings. We analyze security and performance of our protocols and compare them with existing DB techniques when applied to group settings.',

	{'abstract': u"Codes over permutations under the infinity norm have been recently suggested as a coding scheme for correcting limited-magnitude errors in the rank modulation scheme. Given such a code, we show that a simple relabeling operation, which produces an isomorphic code, may drastically change the minimal distance of the code. Thus, we may choose a code structure for efficient encoding/decoding procedures, and then optimize the code's minimal distance via relabeling. We formally define the relabeling problem, and show that all codes may be relabeled to get a minimal distance at most 2. The decision problem of whether a code may be relabeled to distance 1 is shown to be NP-complete, and calculating the best achievable minimal distance after relabeling is proved hard to approximate. Finally, we consider general bounds on the relabeling problem. We specifically show the optimal relabeling distance of cyclic groups. A specific case of a general probabilistic argument is used to show may be relabeled to a minimal distance of .",

	{'abstract': u'We examine the problem of allocating a given total storage budget in a distributed storage system for maximum reliability. A source has a single data object that is to be coded and stored over a set of storage nodes; it is allowed to store any amount of coded data in each node, as long as the total amount of storage used does not exceed the given budget. A data collector subsequently attempts to recover the original data object by accessing only the data stored in a random subset of the nodes. By using an appropriate code, successful recovery can be achieved whenever the total amount of data accessed is at least the size of the original data object. The goal is to find an optimal storage allocation that maximizes the probability of successful recovery. This optimization problem is challenging in general because of its combinatorial nature, despite its simple formulation. We study several variations of the problem, assuming different allocation models and access models. The optimal allocation and the optimal symmetric allocation (in which all nonempty nodes store the same amount of data) are determined for a variety of cases. Our results indicate that the optimal allocations often have nonintuitive structure and are difficult to specify. We also show that depending on the circumstances, coding may or may not be beneficial for reliable storage.',

	{'abstract': u'This paper investigates reliable and covert transmission strategies in a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) wiretap channel with a transmitter, receiver and an adversarial wiretapper, each equipped with multiple antennas. In a departure from existing work, the wiretapper possesses a novel capability to act either as a passive eavesdropper or as an active jammer, under a half-duplex constraint. The transmitter therefore faces a choice between allocating all of its power for data, or broadcasting artificial interference along with the information signal in an attempt to jam the eavesdropper (assuming its instantaneous channel state is unknown). To examine the resulting trade-offs for the legitimate transmitter and the adversary, we model their interactions as a two-person zero-sum game with the ergodic MIMO secrecy rate as the payoff function. We first examine conditions for the existence of pure-strategy Nash equilibria (NE) and the structure of mixed-strategy NE for the strategic form of the game.We then derive equilibrium strategies for the extensive form of the game where players move sequentially under scenarios of perfect and imperfect information. Finally, numerical simulations are presented to examine the equilibrium outcomes of the various scenarios considered.',

	{'abstract': u'Consider the set of source distributions within a fixed maximum relative entropy with respect to a given nominal distribution. Lossless source coding over this relative entropy ball can be approached in more than one way. A problem previously considered is finding a minimax average length source code. The minimizing players are the codeword lengths --- real numbers for arithmetic codes, integers for prefix codes --- while the maximizing players are the uncertain source distributions. Another traditional minimizing objective is the first one considered here, maximum (average) redundancy. This problem reduces to an extension of an exponential Huffman objective treated in the literature but heretofore without direct practical application. In addition to these, this paper examines the related problem of maximal minimax pointwise redundancy and the problem considered by Gawrychowski and Gagie, which, for a sufficiently small relative entropy ball, is equivalent to minimax redundancy. One can consider both Shannon-like coding based on optimal real number ("ideal") codeword lengths and a Huffman-like optimal prefix coding.',

	{'abstract': u'In compressive sensing, a small collection of linear projections of a sparse signal contains enough information to permit signal recovery. Distributed compressive sensing (DCS) extends this framework by defining ensemble sparsity models, allowing a correlated ensemble of sparse signals to be jointly recovered from a collection of separately acquired compressive measurements. In this paper, we introduce a framework for modeling sparse signal ensembles that quantifies the intra- and inter-signal dependencies within and among the signals. This framework is based on a novel bipartite graph representation that links the sparse signal coefficients with the measurements obtained for each signal. Using our framework, we provide fundamental bounds on the number of noiseless measurements that each sensor must collect to ensure that the signals are jointly recoverable.',

	{'abstract': u'We present three voting protocols with unconditional privacy and correctness, without assuming any bound on the number of corrupt participants. All protocols have polynomial complexity and require private channels and a simultaneous broadcast channel. Unlike previously proposed protocols in this model, the protocols that we present deterministically output the exact tally. Our first protocol is a basic voting scheme which allows voters to interact in order to compute the tally. Privacy of the ballot is unconditional in the sense that regardless of the behavior of the dishonest participants nothing can be learned through the protocol that could not be learned in an ideal realisation. Unfortunately, a single dishonest participant can make the protocol abort, in which case the dishonest participants can nevertheless learn the outcome of the tally. Our second protocol introduces voting authorities which improves the communication complexity by limiting interaction to be only between voters and authorities and among the authorities themselves; the simultaneous broadcast is also limited to the authorities. In the second protocol, as long as a single authority is honest, the privacy is unconditional, however, a single corrupt authority or a single corrupt voter can cause the protocol to abort. Our final protocol provides a safeguard against corrupt voters by enabling a verification technique to allow the authorities to revoke incorrect votes without aborting the protocol. Finally, we discuss the implementation of a simultaneous broadcast channel with the use of temporary computational assumptions, yielding versions of our protocols that achieve everlasting security.',

	{'abstract': u'Airport departure operations constitute an important source of airline delays and passenger frustration. Excessive surface traffic is the cause of increased controller and pilot workload; It is also the source of increased emissions; It worsens traffic safety and often does not yield improved runway throughput. Acknowledging this fact, this paper explores some of the feedback mechanisms by which airport traffic can be optimized in real time according to its current degree of congestion. In particular, it examines the environmnetal benefits that improved surveillance technologies can bring in the context of gate- or spot-release aircraft strategies. It is shown that improvements can lead yield 4% to 6% emission reductions for busy airports like New-York La Guardia or Seattle Tacoma. These benefits come on top of the benefits already obtained by adopting threshold strategies currently under evaluation.',

	{'abstract': u'The analysis of online least squares estimation is at the heart of many stochastic sequential decision making problems. We employ tools from the self-normalized processes to provide a simple and self-contained proof of a tail bound of a vector-valued martingale. We use the bound to construct a new tighter confidence sets for the least squares estimate. We apply the confidence sets to several online decision problems, such as the multi-armed and the linearly parametrized bandit problems. The confidence sets are potentially applicable to other problems such as sleeping bandits, generalized linear bandits, and other linear control problems. We improve the regret bound of the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm of Auer et al. (2002) and show that its regret is with high-probability a problem dependent constant. In the case of linear bandits (Dani et al., 2008), we improve the problem dependent bound in the dimension and number of time steps. Furthermore, as opposed to the previous result, we prove that our bound holds for small sample sizes, and at the same time the worst case bound is improved by a logarithmic factor and the constant is improved.',

	{'abstract': u"For the lambda-calculus with letrec we develop an optimisation, which is based on the contraction of a certain class of 'future' (also: virtual) redexes. In the implementation of functional programming languages it is common practice to perform beta-reductions at compile time whenever possible in order to produce code that requires fewer reductions at run time. This is, however, in principle limited to redexes and created redexes that are 'visible' (in the sense that they can be contracted without the need for unsharing), and cannot generally be extended to redexes that are concealed by sharing constructs such as letrec. In the case of recursion, concealed redexes become visible only after unwindings during evaluation, and then have to be contracted time and again. We observe that in some cases such redexes exhibit a certain form of repetitive behaviour at run time. We describe an analysis for identifying binders that give rise to such repetitive reduction patterns, and eliminate them by a sort of predictive contraction. Thereby these binders are lifted out of recursive positions or eliminated altogether, as a result alleviating the amount of beta-reductions required for each recursive iteration. Both our analysis and simplification are suitable to be integrated into existing compilers for functional programming languages as an additional optimisation phase. With this work we hope to contribute to increasing the efficiency of executing programs written in such languages.",

There are two kinds of reduction: anaphoric and lexical. We show that anaphoric reduction depends on the discourse type (vulgarization, pedagogical, specialized) but is independent of both domain and language; that lexical reduction depends on domain and is more frequent in technical, rapidly evolving domains; and that anaphoric reductions tend to follow full terms rather than precede them. We define the notion of the anaphoric tree of the term and study its properties. Concerning lexical reduction, we attempt to prove statistically that there is a notion of term lifecycle, where the full form is progressively replaced by a lexical reduction. ----- Nous 'etudions par des m 'ethodes statistiques sur des corpus fran cais et italiens, le ph 'enom `ene de r 'eduction des termes complexes dans les langues de sp 'ecialit 'e.

	{'abstract': u"This paper investigates the use of graph rewriting systems as a modelling tool, and advocates the embedding of such systems in an interactive environment. One important application domain is the modelling of biochemical systems, where states are represented by port graphs and the dynamics is driven by rules and strategies. A graph rewriting tool's capability to interactively explore the features of the rewriting system provides useful insights into possible behaviours of the model and its properties. We describe PORGY, a visual and interactive tool we have developed to model complex systems using port graphs and port graph rewrite rules guided by strategies, and to navigate in the derivation history. We demonstrate via examples some functionalities provided by PORGY.",

	{'abstract': u'The context of this paper is the use of formal methods for topology-based geometric modelling. Topology-based geometric modelling deals with objects of various dimensions and shapes. Usually, objects are defined by a graph-based topological data structure and by an embedding that associates each topological element (vertex, edge, face, etc.) with relevant data as their geometric shape (position, curve, surface, etc.) or application dedicated data (e.g. molecule concentration level in a biological context). We propose to define topology-based geometric objects as labelled graphs. The arc labelling defines the topological structure of the object whose topological consistency is then ensured by labelling constraints. Nodes have as many labels as there are different data kinds in the embedding. Labelling constraints ensure then that the embedding is consistent with the topological structure. Thus, topology-based geometric objects constitute a particular subclass of a category of labelled graphs in which nodes have multiple labels.',

	{'abstract': u'The relationship between Term Graph Rewriting and Term Rewriting is well understood: a single term graph reduction may correspond to several term reductions, due to sharing. It is also known that if term graphs are allowed to contain cycles, then one term graph reduction may correspond to infinitely many term reductions. We stress that this fact can be interpreted in two ways. According to the "sequential interpretation", a term graph reduction corresponds to an infinite sequence of term reductions, as formalized by Kennaway et.al. using strongly converging derivations over the complete metric space of infinite terms. Instead according to the "parallel interpretation" a term graph reduction corresponds to the parallel reduction of an infinite set of redexes in a rational term. We formalize the latter notion by exploiting the complete partial order of infinite and possibly partial terms, and we stress that this interpretation allows to explain the result of reducing circular redexes in several approaches to term graph rewriting.',

	{'abstract': u"Multi-hop random access networks have received much attention due to their distributed nature which facilitates deploying many new applications over the sensor and computer networks. Recently, utility maximization framework is applied in order to optimize performance of such networks, however proposed algorithms result in large transmission delays. In this paper, we will analyze delay in random access multi-hop networks and solve the delay-constrained utility maximization problem. We define the network utility as a combination of rate utility and energy cost functions and solve the following two problems: 'optimal medium access control with link delay constraint' and, 'optimal congestion and contention control with end-to-end delay constraint'. The optimal tradeoff between delay, rate, and energy is achieved for different values of delay constraint and the scaling factors between rate and energy. Eventually linear and super-linear distributed optimization solutions are proposed for each problem and their performance are compared in terms of convergence and complexity.",

The objectives explored here are exponential-average length and exponential-average redundancy. The first of these relates to various problems involving queueing, uncertainty, and lossless communications, and it can be reduced to the second, which has properties more amenable to analysis. These bounds, some of which are tight, are in terms of a form of entropy and/or the probability of an input symbol, improving on recently discovered bounds of similar form. We also observe properties of optimal codes over the exponential-average redundancy utility.',

	{'abstract': u"In the last few years, there has been a great interest in detecting overlapping communities in complex networks, which is understood as dense groups of nodes featuring a low outbound density. To date, most methods used to compute such communities stem from the field of disjoint community detection by either extending the concept of modularity to an overlapping context or by attempting to decompose the whole set of nodes into several possibly overlapping subsets. In this report we take an orthogonal approach by introducing a metric, the cohesion, rooted in sociological considerations. The cohesion quantifies the community-ness of one given set of nodes, based on the notions of triangles - triplets of connected nodes - and weak ties, instead of the classical view using only edge density. A set of nodes has a high cohesion if it features a high density of triangles and intersects few triangles with the rest of the network. As such, we introduce a numerical characterization of communities: sets of nodes featuring a high cohesion. We then present a new approach to the problem of overlapping communities by introducing the concept of ego-munities, which are subjective communities centered around a given node, specifically inside its neighborhood. We build upon the cohesion to construct a heuristic algorithm which outputs a node's ego-munities by attempting to maximize their cohesion. We illustrate the pertinence of our method with a detailed description of one person's ego-munities among Facebook friends. We finally conclude by describing promising applications of ego-munities such as information inference and interest recommendations, and present a possible extension to cohesion in the case of weighted networks.",

	{'abstract': u"Energy consumption is a main issue of concern in wireless networks. Energy minimization increases the time that networks' nodes work properly without recharging or substituting batteries. Another criterion for network performance is data transmission rate which is usually quantified by a network utility function. There exists an inherent tradeoff between these criteria and enhancing one of them can deteriorate the other one. In this paper, we consider both Network Utility Maximization (NUM) and energy minimization in a bi-criterion optimization problem. The problem is formulated for Random Access (RA) Medium Access Control (MAC) for ad-hoc networks. First, we optimize performance of the MAC and define utility as a monotonically increasing function of link throughputs. We investigate the optimal tradeoff between energy and utility in this part. In the second part, we define utility as a function of end to end rates and optimize MAC and transport layers simultaneously. We calculate optimal persistence probabilities and end-to-end rates. Finally, by means of duality theorem, we decompose the problem into smaller subproblems, which are solved at node and network layers separately. This decomposition avoids need for a central unit while sustaining benefits of layering.",

	{'abstract': u'In case of multiple node failures performance becomes very low as compare to single node failure. Failures of nodes in cluster computing can be tolerated by multiple fault tolerant computing. Existing recovery schemes are efficient for single fault but not with multiple faults. Recovery scheme proposed in this paper having two phases; sequentially phase, concurrent phase. In sequentially phase, loads of all working nodes are uniformly and evenly distributed by proposed dynamic rank based and load distribution algorithm. In concurrent phase, loads of all failure nodes as well as new job arrival are assigned equally to all available nodes by just finding the least loaded node among the several nodes by failure nodes job allocation algorithm. Sequential and concurrent executions of algorithms improve the performance as well better resource utilization. Dynamic rank based algorithm for load redistribution works as a sequential restoration algorithm and reassignment algorithm for distribution of failure nodes to least loaded computing nodes works as a concurrent recovery reassignment algorithm. Since load is evenly and uniformly distributed among all available working nodes with less number of iterations, low iterative time and communication overheads hence performance is improved. Dynamic ranking algorithm is low overhead, high convergence algorithm for reassignment of tasks uniformly among all available nodes. Reassignments of failure nodes are done by a low overhead efficient failure job allocation algorithm. Test results to show effectiveness of the proposed scheme are presented.',

	{'abstract': u'Rate, energy and delay are three main parameters of interest in ad-hoc networks. In this paper, we discuss the problem of maximizing network utility and minimizing energy consumption while satisfying a given transmission delay constraint for each packet. We formulate this problem in the standard convex optimization form and subsequently discuss the tradeoff between utility, energy and delay in such framework. Also, in order to adapt for the distributed nature of the network, a distributed algorithm where nodes decide on choosing transmission rates and probabilities based on their local information is introduced.',

	{'abstract': u"Cloud computing is one of the rapidly improving technologies. It provides scalable resources needed for the ap- plications hosted on it. As cloud-based services become more dynamic, resource provisioning becomes more challenging. The QoS constrained resource allocation problem is considered in this paper, in which customers are willing to host their applications on the provider's cloud with a given SLA requirements for performance such as throughput and response time. Since, the data centers hosting the applications consume huge amounts of energy and cause huge operational costs, solutions that reduce energy consumption as well as operational costs are gaining importance. In this work, we propose an energy efficient mechanism that allocates the cloud resources to the applications without violating the given service level agreements(SLA) using Ant colony framework.",

	{'abstract': u'In this paper, we propose novel state-based algorithms which dynamically control the random access network based on its current state such as channel states of wireless links and backlog states of the queues. After formulating the problem, corresponding algorithms with diverse control functions are proposed. Consequently, it will be shown that the proposed state-based schemes for control of the random access networks, results in significant performance gains in comparison with previously proposed control algorithms. In order to select an appropriate control function, performances of the state-based control algorithms are compared for a wide range of traffic scenarios. It is also shown that even an approximate knowledge of network statistics helps in selecting the proper state dependent control function.',

	{'abstract': u'This paper addresses rate control for transmission of scalable video streams via Network Utility Maximization (NUM) formulation. Due to stringent QoS requirements of video streams and specific characterization of utility experienced by end-users, one has to solve nonconvex and even nonsmooth NUM formulation for such streams, where dual methods often prove incompetent. Convexification plays an important role in this work as it permits the use of existing dual methods to solve an approximate to the NUM problem iteratively and distributively. Hence, to tackle the nonsmoothness and nonconvexity, we aim at reformulating the NUM problem through approximation and transformation of the ideal discretely adaptive utility function for scalable video streams. The reformulated problem is shown to be a D.C. (Difference of Convex) problem. We leveraged Sequential Convex Programming (SCP) approach to replace the nonconvex D.C. problem by a sequence of convex problems that aim to approximate the original D.C. problem. We then solve each convex problem produced by SCP approach using existing dual methods. This procedure is the essence of two distributed iterative rate control algorithms proposed in this paper, for which one can show the convergence to a locally optimal point of the nonconvex D.C. problem and equivalently to a locally optimal point of an approximate to the original nonconvex problem. Our experimental results show that the proposed rate control algorithms converge with tractable convergence behavior.',

	{'abstract': u'The paper discusses properties of a DATALOG-like query language 4QL, originally outlined in [MS10]. Negated literals in heads of rules naturally lead to inconsistencies. On the other hand, rules do not have to attach meaning to some literals. Therefore 4QL is founded on a four-valued semantics, employing the logic introduced in [MSV08, VMS09] with truth values: \'true\', \'false\', \'inconsistent\' and \'unknown\'. 4QL allows one to use rules with negation in heads and bodies of rules, it is based on a simple and intuitive semantics and provides uniform tools for "lightweight" versions of known forms of nonmonotonic reasoning. In addition, 4QL is tractable as regards its data complexity and captures PTIME queries. Even if DATALOG is known as a concept for the last 30 years, to our best knowledge no existing approach enjoys these properties. In the current paper we: - investigate properties of well-supported models of 4QL - prove the correctness of the algorithm for computing well-supported models - show that 4QL has PTIME data complexity and captures PTIME.',

	{'abstract': u'In this paper, we present a new method for variable elimination in systems of inequations which is much faster than the Fourier-Motzkin Elimination (FME) method. In our method, a linear Diophantine problem is introduced which is dual to our original problem. The new Diophantine system is then solved, and the final result is calculated by finding the dual inequations system. Our new method uses the algorithm Normaliz to find the Hilbert basis of the solution space of the given Diophantine problem. We introduce a problem in the interference channel with multiple nodes and solve it with our new method. Next, we generalize our method to all problems involving FME and in the end we compare our method with the previous method. We show that our method has many advantages in comparison to the previous method. It does not produce many of the redundant answers of the FME method. It also solves the whole problem in one step whereas the previous method uses a step by step approach in eliminating each auxiliary variable.',

	{'abstract': u"A sensor network can be described as a collection of sensor nodes which co-ordinate with each other to perform some specific function. These sensor nodes are mainly in large numbers and are densely deployed either inside the phenomenon or very close to it. They can be used for various application areas (e.g. health, military, home). Failures are inevitable in wireless sensor networks due to inhospitable environment and unattended deployment. Therefore, it is necessary that network failures are detected in advance and appropriate measures are taken to sustain network operation. We previously proposed a cellular approach for fault detection and recovery. In this paper we extend the cellular approach and propose a new fault management mechanism to deal with fault detection and recovery. We propose a hierarchical structure to properly distribute fault management tasks among sensor nodes by introducing more 'self-managing' functions. The proposed failure detection and recovery algorithm has been compared with some existing related work and proven to be more energy efficient.",

Virtual machines (VMs) are utilized to satisfy the user needs and are placed on physical machines (PMs) of the cloud for effective usage of hardware resources and electricity in the cloud. Optimizing the number of PMs used helps in cutting down the power consumption by a substantial amount. In this paper, we present an optimal technique to map virtual machines to physical machines (nodes) such that the number of required nodes is minimized.

	{'abstract': u'Lifted maximum rank distance (MRD) codes, which are constant dimension codes, are considered. It is shown that a lifted MRD code can be represented in such a way that it forms a block design known as a transversal design. A slightly different representation of this design makes it similar to a analog of a transversal design. The structure of these designs is used to obtain upper bounds on the sizes of constant dimension codes which contain a lifted MRD code. Codes which attain these bounds are constructed. These codes are the largest known codes for the given parameters. These transversal designs can be also used to derive a new family of linear codes in the Hamming space. Bounds on the minimum distance and the dimension of such codes are given.',

	{'abstract': u'The high-level contribution of this paper is a simulation-based analysis to evaluate the tradeoffs between lifetime and hop count of link-disjoint, node-disjoint and zone-disjoint multi-path routes vis- `a-vis single-path minimum hop routes for mobile ad hoc networks. The link-disjoint, node-disjoint and zone-disjoint algorithms proposed in this paper can be used to arrive at benchmarks for the time between successive multi-path route discoveries, the number of disjoint paths per multi-path set and the hop count per multi-path set. We assume a multi-path set exists as long as at least one path in the set exists. Simulation results indicate that the number of zone-disjoint paths per multi-path set can be at most 2, which is far lower than the number of node and link-disjoint paths available per multi-path set. Also, the time between zone-disjoint multi-path discoveries would be far lower than the time between node and link-disjoint multi-path route discoveries and can be at most 45% more than the time between single minimum-hop path route discoveries. However, there is no appreciable difference in the average hop counts per zone-disjoint, node-disjoint and link-disjoint multi-path sets and it can be only at most 15% more than the average minimum hop count determined using single-path routing. We also observe that even though the number of link-disjoint paths per multi-path set can be as large as 35-78% more than the number of node-disjoint paths per multi-path set, the time between two successive link-disjoint multi-path discoveries can be at most 15-25% more than the time between two successive node-disjoint multi-path discoveries, without any significant difference in the hop count per multi-path set.',

	{'abstract': u'In reaction to a previous critique(Opthof &amp; Leydesdorff, 2010), the Center for Science and Technology Studies (CWTS) in Leiden proposed to change their old "crown" indicator in citation analysis into a new one. Waltman et al. (2011)argue that this change does not affect rankings at various aggregated levels. However, CWTS data is not publicly available for testing and criticism. In this correspondence, we use previously published data of Van Raan (2006) to address the pivotal issue of how the results of citation analysis correlate with the results of peer review. A quality parameter based on peer review was neither significantly correlated with the two parameters developed by the CWTS in the past (CPP/JCSm or CPP/FCSm) nor with the more recently proposed h-index (Hirsch, 2005). Given the high correlations between the old and new "crown" indicators, one can expect that the lack of correlation with the peer-review based quality indicator applies equally to the newly developed ones.',

	{'abstract': u'Traffic Engineering (TE) leverages information of network traffic to generate a routing scheme optimizing the traffic distribution so as to advance network performance. However, optimize the link weights for OSPF to the offered traffic is an known NP-hard problem. In this paper, motivated by the fairness concept of congestion control, we firstly propose a new generic objective function, where various interests of providers can be extracted with different parameter settings. And then, we model the optimal TE as the utility maximization of multi-commodity flows with the generic objective function and theoretically show that any given set of optimal routes corresponding to a particular objective function can be converted to shortest paths with respect to a set of positive link weights. This can be directly configured on OSPF-based protocols. On these bases, we employ the Network Entropy Maximization(NEM) framework and develop a new OSPF-based routing protocol, SPEF, to realize a flexible way to split traffic over shortest paths in a distributed fashion. Actually, comparing to OSPF, SPEF only needs one more weight for each link and provably achieves optimal TE. Numerical experiments have been done to compare SPEF with the current version of OSPF, showing the effectiveness of SPEF in terms of link utilization and network load distribution.',

	{'abstract': u'One of the most important open problems in machine scheduling is the problem of scheduling a set of jobs on unrelated machines to minimize the makespan. The best known approximation algorithm for this problem guarantees an approximation factor of 2. It is known to be NP-hard to approximate with a better ratio than 3/2. Closing this gap has been open for over 20 years. The best known approximation factors are achieved by LP-based algorithms. The strongest known linear program formulation for the problem is the configuration-LP. We show that the configuration-LP has an integrality gap of 2 even for the special case of unrelated graph balancing, where each job can be assigned to at most two machines. In particular, our result implies that a large family of cuts does not help to diminish the integrality gap of the canonical assignment-LP. Also, we present cases of the problem which can be approximated with a better factor than 2. They constitute valuable insights for constructing an NP-hardness reduction which improves the known lower bound. Very recently Svensson studied the restricted assignment case, where each job can only be assigned to a given set of machines on which it has the same processing time. He shows that in this setting the configuration-LP has an integrality gap of 33/17&lt;2. Hence, our result imply that the unrelated graph balancing case is significantly more complex than the restricted assignment case. Then we turn to another objective function: maximizing the minimum machine load. For the case that every job can be assigned to at most two machines we give a purely combinatorial 2-approximation algorithm which is best possible, unless P=NP. This improves on the computationally costly LP-based (2+eps)-approximation algorithm by Chakrabarty et al.',

	{'abstract': u'We investigate the problem of finding reverse nearest neighbors efficiently. Although provably good solutions exist for this problem in low or fixed dimensions, to this date the methods proposed in high dimensions are mostly heuristic. We introduce a method that is both provably correct and efficient in all dimensions, based on a reduction of the problem to one instance of -nearest neighbor search plus a controlled number of instances of , a variant of where all the -balls centered at the data points that contain the query point are sought for, not just one. The former problem has been extensively studied and elegantly solved in high dimensions using Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) techniques. By contrast, the latter problem has a complexity that is still not fully understood. We revisit the analysis of the LSH scheme for exhaustive - pleb using a somewhat refined notion of locality-sensitive family of hash function, which brings out a meaningful output-sensitive term in the complexity of the problem. Our analysis, combined with a non-isometric lifting of the data, enables us to answer exhaustive - pleb queries (and down the road reverse nearest neighbors queries) efficiently. Along the way, we obtain a simple algorithm for answering exact nearest neighbor queries, whose complexity is parametrized by some measuring the inherent difficulty of a given instance of the problem.',

In this paper, we show that the dyadic variant can be designed to resist all known attacks. In light of a new study on list decoding algorithms for binary Goppa codes, we explain how to increase the security level for given public keysizes. Using the state-of-the-art list decoding algorithm instead of unique decoding, we exhibit a keysize gain of about 4% for the standard McEliece cryptosystem and up to 21% for the adjusted dyadic variant.',

	{'abstract': u"We consider the problem of sensor selection for event detection in wireless sensor networks (WSNs). We want to choose a subset of p out of n sensors that yields the best detection performance. As the sensor selection optimality criteria, we propose the Kullback-Leibler and Chernoff distances between the distributions of the selected measurements under the two hypothesis. We formulate the maxmin robust sensor selection problem to cope with the uncertainties in distribution means. We prove that the sensor selection problem is NP hard, for both Kullback-Leibler and Chernoff criteria. To (sub)optimally solve the sensor selection problem, we propose an algorithm of affordable complexity. Extensive numerical simulations on moderate size problem instances (when the optimum by exhaustive search is feasible to compute) demonstrate the algorithm's near optimality in a very large portion of problem instances. For larger problems, extensive simulations demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms random searches, once an upper bound on computational time is set. We corroborate numerically the validity of the Kullback-Leibler and Chernoff sensor selection criteria, by showing that they lead to sensor selections nearly optimal both in the Neyman-Pearson and Bayes sense.",

	{'abstract': u'A challenging problem in multi-band multi-cell self-organized wireless systems, such as multi-channel Wi-Fi networks, femto/pico cells in 3G/4G cellular networks, and more recent wireless networks over TV white spaces, is of distributed resource allocation. This involves four components: channel selection, client association, channel access, and client scheduling. In this paper, we present a unified framework for jointly addressing the four components with the global system objective of maximizing the clients throughput in a proportionally fair manner. Our formulation allows a natural dissociation of the problem into two sub-parts. We show that the first part, involving channel access and client scheduling, is convex and derive a distributed adaptation procedure for achieving Pareto-optimal solution. For the second part, involving channel selection and client association, we develop a Gibbs-sampler based approach for local adaptation to achieve the global objective, as well as derive fast greedy algorithms from it that achieve good solutions.',

	{'abstract': u'Analyzing the relationships among the parameters for quantifying the quality of research published in journals is a challenging task. In this paper, we analyze the relationships between impact factor, h-index, and g-index of a journal. To keep our analysis simple and easy to understand, we consider a generalized version of the impact factor where there is no time window. In the absence of the time window, the impact factor converges to the number of citations received per paper. This is not only justified for the impact factor, it simplifies the analysis of h-index and g-index as well because addition of a time window in the form of years complicates the computation of indices too. We derive the expressions for the relationships among impact factor, h-index, and g-index and validate them using a given set of publication-citation data.',

	{'abstract': u'In this paper we consider a logical treatment for the ordered disjunction operator \'x\' introduced by Brewka, Niemel "a and Syrj "anen in their Logic Programs with Ordered Disjunctions (LPOD). LPODs are used to represent preferences in logic programming under the answer set semantics. Their semantics is defined by first translating the LPOD into a set of normal programs (called split programs) and then imposing a preference relation among the answer sets of these split programs. We concentrate on the first step and show how a suitable translation of the ordered disjunction as a derived operator into the logic of Here-and-There allows capturing the answer sets of the split programs in a direct way. We use this characterisation not only for providing an alternative implementation for LPODs, but also for checking several properties (under strongly equivalent transformations) of the \'x\' operator, like for instance, its distributivity with respect to conjunction or regular disjunction. We also make a comparison to an extension proposed by K "arger, Lopes, Olmedilla and Polleres, that combines \'x\' with regular disjunction.',

In particular, we show that the expected termination time can be approximated up to an arbitrarily small relative error with polynomially many arithmetic operations, and the same holds for the probability of all runs that satisfy a given omega-regular property. Further, our results establish a powerful link between pOC and martingale theory, which leads to fundamental observations about quantitative properties of runs in pOC. In particular, we provide a "divergence gap theorem", which bounds a positive non-termination probability in pOC away from zero.',

The solving scheme is based on several models: multicriteria ranking, clustering, minimum spanning tree, and minimum Steiner tree problem. An illustrative numerical example corresponds to designing a covering long-distance Wi-Fi network (static Ad-Hoc network). The set of criteria (i.e., objective functions) involves the following: total cost, total edge length, overall throughput (capacity), and estimate of QoS. Obtained computing results show the suggested solving scheme provides good network topologies which can be compared with minimum spanning trees.',

	{'abstract': u'Pair-wise Markov random fields (MRF) are considered for application to the development of low complexity, iterative MIMO detection. Specifically, we consider two types of MRF, namely, the fully-connected and ring-type. For the edge potentials, we use the bivariate Gaussian function obtained by marginalizing the posterior joint probability density under the Gaussian assumption. Since the corresponding factor graphs are sparse, in the sense that the number of edges connected to a factor node (edge degree) is only 2, the computations are much easier than that of ML, which is similar to the belief propagation (BP), or sum-product, algorithm that is run over the fully connected factor graph. The BER performances for non-Gaussian input are evaluated via simulation, and the results show the validity of the proposed algorithms. We also customize the algorithm for Gaussian input to obtain the Gaussian BP that is run over the two MRF and proves its convergence in mean to the linear MMSE estimates. The result lies on the same line of those in [16] and [24], but with differences in its graphical model and the message passing rule. Since the MAP estimator for the Gaussian input is equivalent to the linear MMSE estimator, it shows the optimality, in mean, of the scheme for Gaussian input.',

	{'abstract': u'We present an iterative algorithm for enforcing policies represented in a first-order logic, which can, in particular, express all transmission-related clauses in the HIPAA Privacy Rule. The logic has three features that raise challenges for enforcement --- uninterpreted predicates (used to model subjective concepts in privacy policies), real-time temporal properties, and quantification over infinite domains (such as the set of messages containing personal information). The algorithm operates over audit logs that are inherently incomplete and evolve over time. In each iteration, the algorithm provably checks as much of the policy as possible over the current log and outputs a residual policy that can only be checked when the log is extended with additional information. We prove correctness and termination properties of the algorithm. While these results are developed in a general form, accounting for many different sources of incompleteness in audit logs, we also prove that for the special case of logs that maintain a complete record of all relevant actions, the algorithm effectively enforces all safety and co-safety properties. The algorithm can significantly help automate enforcement of policies derived from the HIPAA Privacy Rule.',

	{'abstract': u"In this paper, coded slotted ALOHA (CSA) is introduced as a powerful random access scheme to the MAC frame. In CSA, the burst a generic user wishes to transmit in the MAC frame is first split into segments, and these segments are then encoded through a local a packet-oriented code prior to transmission. On the receiver side, iterative interference cancellation combined with decoding of the local code is performed to recover from collisions. The new scheme generalizes the previously proposed irregular repetition slotted ALOHA (IRSA) technique, based on a simple repetition of the users' bursts. An interpretation of the CSA interference cancellation process as an iterative erasure decoding process over a sparse bipartite graph is identified, and the corresponding density evolution equations derived. Based on these equations, asymptotically optimal CSA schemes are designed for several rates and their performance for a finite number of users investigated through simulation and compared to IRSA competitors. Throughputs as high as 0.8 are demonstrated. The new scheme turns out to be a good candidate in contexts where power efficiency is required.",

The general CSP is known to be NP-complete, but its complexity depends on a template, usually a set of relations, upon which they are constructed. Following this template, there exist tractable and intractable instances of CSPs. It has been proved that for each CSP problem over a given set of relations there exists a corresponding CSP problem over graphs of unary functions belonging to the same complexity class.

	{'abstract': u"We consider a wireless relay network with multiple antenna terminals over Rayleigh fading channels, and apply distributed space-time coding (DSTC) in amplify-and-forward (A&amp;F) mode. The A&amp;F scheme is used in a way that each relay transmits a scaled version of the linear combination of the received symbols. It turns out that, combined with power allocation in the relays, A&amp;F DSTC results in an opportunistic relaying scheme, in which only the best relay is selected to retransmit the source's space-time coded signal. Furthermore, assuming the knowledge of source-relay CSI at the source node, we design an efficient power allocation which outperforms uniform power allocation across the source antennas. Next, assuming M-PSK or M-QAM modulations, we analyze the performance of the proposed cooperative diversity transmission schemes in a wireless relay networks with the multiple-antenna source and destination. We derive the probability density function (PDF) of the received SNR at the destination. Then, the PDF is used to determine the symbol error rate (SER) in Rayleigh fading channels. We derived closed-form approximations of the average SER in the high SNR scenario, from which we find the diversity order of system RminfNs;Ndg, where R, Ns, and Nd are the number of the relays, source antennas, and destination antennas, respectively. Simulation results show that the proposed system obtain more than 6 dB gain in SNR over A&amp;F MIMO DSTC for BER 10^, when R = 2, Ns = 2, and Nd = 1.",

	{'abstract': u'The broadcast phase (downlink transmission) of the two-way relay network is studied in the source coding and joint source-channel coding settings. The rates needed for reliable communication are characterised for a number of special cases including: small distortions, deterministic distortion measures, and jointly Gaussian sources with quadratic distortion measures. The broadcast problem is also studied with common-reconstruction decoding constraints, and the rates needed for reliable communication are characterised for all discrete memoryless sources and per-letter distortion measures.',

	{'abstract': u'This paper investigates the problem of spectrally efficient operation of a multiuser uplink cognitive radio system in the presence of a single primary link. The secondary system applies opportunistic interference cancelation (OIC) and decode the primary signal when such an opportunity is created. We derive the achievable rate in the secondary system when OIC is used. This scheme has a practical significance, since it enables rate adaptation without requiring any action from the primary system. The emph expressions for outage probability of the primary user are derived, when the primary system is exposed to interference from secondary users. Moreover, approximated formulas and tight lower and upper bounds for the ergodic sum-rate capacity of the secondary network are found. Next, the power allocation is investigated in the secondary system for maximizing the sum-rate under an outage constraint at the primary system. We formulate the power optimization problem in various scenarios depending on the availability of channel state information and the type of power constraints, and propose a set of simple solutions. Finally, the analytical results are confirmed by simulations, indicating both the accuracy of the analysis, and the fact that the spectral-efficient, low-complexity, flexible, and high-performing cognitive radio can be designed based on the proposed schemes.',

	{'abstract': u"Model theoretic results such as Characterization and Definability give important information about different logics. It is well known that the proofs of those results for several modal logics have, somehow, the same 'taste'. A general proof for most modal logics below first order is still too ambitious. In this thesis we plan to isolate sufficient conditions for the characterization and definability theorems to hold in a wide range of logics. Along with these conditions we will prove that, whichever logic that meets them, satisfies both theorems. Therefore, one could give an unifying proof for logics with already known results. Moreover, one will be able to prove characterization and definability results for logics that have not yet been investigated. In both cases, it is only needed to check that a logic meets the requirements to automatically derive the desired results.",

	{'abstract': u'We consider two-source two-destination (i.e., two-unicast) multi-hop wireless networks that have a layered structure with arbitrary connectivity. We show that, if the channel gains are chosen independently according to continuous distributions, then, with probability 1, two-unicast layered Gaussian networks can only have 1, 3/2 or 2 sum degrees-of-freedom (unless both source-destination pairs are disconnected, in which case no degrees-of-freedom can be achieved). We provide sufficient and necessary conditions for each case based on network connectivity and a new notion of source-destination paths with manageable interference. Our achievability scheme is based on forwarding the received signals at all nodes, except for a small fraction of them in at most two key layers. Hence, we effectively create a "condensed network" that has at most four layers (including the sources layer and the destinations layer). We design the transmission strategies based on the structure of this condensed network. The converse results are obtained by developing information-theoretic inequalities that capture the structures of the network connectivity. Finally, we extend this result and characterize the full degrees-of-freedom region of two-unicast layered wireless networks.',

	{'abstract': u'Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Enhanced Collision Avoidance (CSMA/ECA) is a distributed MAC protocol that allows collision-free access to the medium in WLAN. The only difference between CSMA/ECA and the well-known CSMA/CA is that the former uses a deterministic backoff after successful transmissions. Collision-free operation is reached after a transient state during which some collisions may occur. This article shows that the duration of the transient state can be shortened by appropriately setting the contention parameters. Standard absorbing Markov Chain theory can be used to describe the behaviour of the system in the transient state and to predict the expected number of slots to reach the collision-free operation. The article also introduces CSMA/E2CA, in which a deterministic backoff is used two consecutive times after a successful transmission. CSMA/E2CA converges quicker to collision-free operation and delivers higher performance than CSMA/CA in harsh wireless scenarios with high frame error rates. To achieve collision-free operations when the number of contenders is large, it may be necessary to dynamically adjust the contention parameter. The last part of the article suggests an approach for such parameter adjustment which is validated by simulation results.',

	{'abstract': u'"What other people think" has always been an important piece of information during various decision-making processes. Today people frequently make their opinions available via the Internet, and as a result, the Web has become an excellent source for gathering consumer opinions. There are now numerous Web resources containing such opinions, e.g., product reviews forums, discussion groups, and Blogs. But, due to the large amount of information and the wide range of sources, it is essentially impossible for a customer to read all of the reviews and make an informed decision on whether to purchase the product. It is also difficult for the manufacturer or seller of a product to accurately monitor customer opinions. For this reason, mining customer reviews, or opinion mining, has become an important issue for research in Web information extraction. One of the important topics in this research area is the identification of opinion polarity. The opinion polarity of a review is usually expressed with values \'positive\', \'negative\' or \'neutral\'. We propose a technique for identifying polarity of reviews by identifying the polarity of the adjectives that appear in them. Our evaluation shows the technique can provide accuracy in the area of 73%, which is well above the 58%-64% provided by naive Bayesian classifiers.',

	{'abstract': u'In this paper we propose a new wavelet transform applicable to functions defined on graphs, high dimensional data and networks. The proposed method generalizes the Haar-like transform proposed in [1], and it is defined via a hierarchical tree, which is assumed to capture the geometry and structure of the input data. It is applied to the data using a modified version of the common one-dimensional (1D) wavelet filtering and decimation scheme, which can employ different wavelet filters. In each level of this wavelet decomposition scheme, a permutation derived from the tree is applied to the approximation coefficients, before they are filtered. We propose a tree construction method that results in an efficient representation of the input function in the transform domain. We show that the proposed transform is more efficient than both the 1D and two-dimensional (2D) separable wavelet transforms in representing images. We also explore the application of the proposed transform to image denoising, and show that combined with a subimage averaging scheme, it achieves denoising results which are similar to those obtained with the K-SVD algorithm.',

	{'abstract': u'Smartphone apps often run with full privileges to access the network and sensitive local resources, making it difficult for remote systems to have any trust in the provenance of network connections they receive. Even within the phone, different apps with different privileges can communicate with one another, allowing one app to trick another into improperly exercising its privileges (a Confused Deputy attack). In Quire, we engineered two new security mechanisms into Android to address these issues. First, we track the call chain of IPCs, allowing an app the choice of operating with the diminished privileges of its callers or to act explicitly on its own behalf. Second, a lightweight signature scheme allows any app to create a signed statement that can be verified anywhere inside the phone. Both of these mechanisms are reflected in network RPCs, allowing remote systems visibility into the state of the phone when an RPC is made. We demonstrate the usefulness of Quire with two example applications. We built an advertising service, running distinctly from the app which wants to display ads, which can validate clicks passed to it from its host. We also built a payment service, allowing an app to issue a request which the payment service validates with the user. An app cannot not forge a payment request by directly connecting to the remote server, nor can the local payment service tamper with the request.',

	{'abstract': u'Optimal prefix codes are studied for pairs of independent, integer-valued symbols emitted by a source with a geometric probability distribution of parameter , . By encoding pairs of symbols, it is possible to reduce the redundancy penalty of symbol-by-symbol encoding, while preserving the simplicity of the encoding and decoding procedures typical of Golomb codes and their variants. It is shown that optimal codes for these so-called two-dimensional geometric distributions are emph, in the sense that a prefix code that is optimal for one value of the parameter cannot be optimal for any other value of . This is in sharp contrast to the one-dimensional case, where codes are optimal for positive-length intervals of the parameter . Thus, in the two-dimensional case, it is infeasible to give a compact characterization of optimal codes for all values of the parameter , as was done in the one-dimensional case. Instead, optimal codes are characterized for a discrete sequence of values of that provide good coverage of the unit interval. Specifically, optimal prefix codes are described for (), covering the range , and (), covering the range . The described codes produce the expected reduction in redundancy with respect to the one-dimensional case, while maintaining low complexity coding operations.',

	{'abstract': u'This paper considers a system where one transmitter broadcasts a single common message to two receivers linked by a bidirectional cooperation channel, which is assumed to be orthogonal to the downlink channel. Assuming a simplified setup where, in particular, scalar relaying protocols are used and channel coding is not exploited, we want to provide elements of response to several questions of practical interest. Here are the main underlying issues: 1. The way of recombining the signals at the receivers; 2. The optimal number of cooperation rounds; 3. The way of cooperating (symmetrically or asymmetrically; which receiver should start cooperating in the latter case); 4. The influence of spectral resources. These issues are considered by studying the performance of the assumed system through analytical results when they are derivable and through simulation results. For the particular choices we made, the results sometimes do not coincide with those available for the discrete counterpart of the studied channel.',

	{'abstract': u'We consider wireless networks that can be modeled by multiple access channels in which all the terminals are equipped with multiple antennas. The propagation model used to account for the effects of transmit and receive antenna correlations is the unitary-invariant-unitary model, which is one of the most general models available in the literature. In this context, we introduce and analyze two resource allocation games. In both games, the mobile stations selfishly choose their power allocation policies in order to maximize their individual uplink transmission rates; in particular they can ignore some specified centralized policies. In the first game considered, the base station implements successive interference cancellation (SIC) and each mobile station chooses his best space-time power allocation scheme; here, a coordination mechanism is used to indicate to the users the order in which the receiver applies SIC. In the second framework, the base station is assumed to implement single-user decoding. For these two games a thorough analysis of the Nash equilibrium is provided: the existence and uniqueness issues are addressed; the corresponding power allocation policies are determined by exploiting random matrix theory; the sum-rate efficiency of the equilibrium is studied analytically in the low and high signal-to-noise ratio regimes and by simulations in more typical scenarios. Simulations show that, in particular, the sum-rate efficiency is high for the type of systems investigated and the performance loss due to the use of the proposed suboptimum coordination mechanism is very small.',

	{'abstract': u'Main contribution of this paper is an investigation of expressive power of the database category DB. An object in this category is a database-instance (set of n-ary relations). Morphisms are not functions but have complex tree structures based on a set of complex query computations. They express the semantics of view-based mappings between databases. The higher (logical) level scheme mappings between databases, usually written in some high expressive logical language, may be functorially translated into this base "computation" DB category . The behavioral point of view for databases is assumed, with behavioural equivalence of databases corresponding to isomorphism of objects in DB category. The introduced observations, which are view-based computations without side-effects, are based (from Universal algebra) on monad endofunctor T, which is the closure operator for objects and for morphisms also. It was shown that DB is symmetric (with a bijection between arrows and objects) 2-category, equal to its dual, complete and cocomplete. In this paper we demonstrate that DB is concrete, locally small and finitely presentable. Moreover, it is enriched over itself monoidal symmetric category with a tensor products for matching, and has a parameterized merging database operation. We show that it is an algebraic lattice and we define a database metric space and a subobject classifier: thus, DB category is a monoidal elementary topos.',

	{'abstract': u'The problem of energy-efficient precoding is investigated when the terminals in the system are equipped with multiple antennas. Considering static and fast-fading multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channels, the energy-efficiency is defined as the transmission rate to power ratio and shown to be maximized at low transmit power. The most interesting case is the one of slow fading MIMO channels. For this type of channels, the optimal precoding scheme is generally not trivial. Furthermore, using all the available transmit power is not always optimal in the sense of energy-efficiency (which, in this case, corresponds to the communication-theoretic definition of the goodput-to-power (GPR) ratio). Finding the optimal precoding matrices is shown to be a new open problem and is solved in several special cases: 1. when there is only one receive antenna; 2. in the low or high signal-to-noise ratio regime; 3. when uniform power allocation and the regime of large numbers of antennas are assumed. A complete numerical analysis is provided to illustrate the derived results and stated conjectures. In particular, the impact of the number of antennas on the energy-efficiency is assessed and shown to be significant.',

	{'abstract': u'In this paper, we introduce Continuation Passing C (CPC), a programming language for concurrent systems in which native and cooperative threads are unified and presented to the programmer as a single abstraction. The CPC compiler uses a compilation technique, based on the CPS transform, that yields efficient code and an extremely lightweight representation for contexts. We provide a proof of the correctness of our compilation scheme. We show in particular that lambda-lifting, a common compilation technique for functional languages, is also correct in an imperative language like C, under some conditions enforced by the CPC compiler. The current CPC compiler is mature enough to write substantial programs such as Hekate, a highly concurrent BitTorrent seeder. Our benchmark results show that CPC is as efficient, while using significantly less space, as the most efficient thread libraries available.',

	{'abstract': u'We consider continuous-time consensus seeking systems whose time-dependent interactions are cut-balanced, in the following sense: if a group of agents influences the remaining ones, the former group is also influenced by the remaining ones by at least a proportional amount. Models involving symmetric interconnections and models in which a weighted average of the agent values is conserved are special cases. We prove that such systems always converge. We give a sufficient condition on the evolving interaction topology for the limit values of two agents to be the same. Conversely, we show that if our condition is not satisfied, then these limits are generically different. These results allow treating systems where the agent interactions are a priori unknown, e.g., random or determined endogenously by the agent values. We also derive corresponding results for discrete-time systems.',

	{'abstract': u'Large-scale power blackouts caused by cascading failure are inflicting enormous socioeconomic costs. We study the problem of cascading link failures in power networks modelled by random geometric graphs from a percolation-based viewpoint. To reflect the fact that links fail according to the amount of power flow going through them, we introduce a model where links fail according to a probability which depends on the number of neighboring links. We devise a mapping which maps links in a random geometric graph to nodes in a corresponding dual covering graph. This mapping enables us to obtain the first-known analytical conditions on the existence and non-existence of a large component of operational links after degree-dependent link failures. Next, we present a simple but descriptive model for cascading link failure, and use the degree-dependent link failure results to obtain the first-known analytical conditions on the existence and non-existence of cascading link failures.',

	{'abstract': u"Despite the increasing diffusion of the Internet technology, TV remains the principal medium of communication. People's perceptions, knowledge, beliefs and opinions about matter of facts get (in)formed through the information reported on by the mass-media. However, a single source of information (and consensus) could be a potential cause of anomalies in the structure and evolution of a society. Hence, as the information available (and the way it is reported) is fundamental for our perceptions and opinions, the definition of conditions allowing for a good information to be disseminated is a pressing challenge. In this paper starting from a report on the last Italian political campaign in 2008, we derive a socio-cognitive computational model of opinion dynamics where agents get informed by different sources of information. Then, a what-if analysis, performed trough simulations on the model's parameters space, is shown. In particular, the scenario implemented includes three main streams of information acquisition, differing in both the contents and the perceived reliability of the messages spread. Agents' internal opinion is updated either by accessing one of the information sources, namely media and experts, or by exchanging information with one another. They are also endowed with cognitive mechanisms to accept, reject or partially consider the acquired information.",

	{'abstract': u'We present two methods to compress the description of a route in a road network, i.e., of a path in a directed graph. The first method represents a path by a sequence of via edges. The subpaths between the via edges have to be unique shortest paths. Instead of via edges also via nodes can be used, though this requires some simple preprocessing. The second method uses contraction hierarchies to replace subpaths of the original path by shortcuts. The two methods can be combined with each other. Also, we propose the application to mobile server based routing: We compute the route on a server which has access to the latest information about congestions for example. Then we transmit the computed route to the car using some mobile radio communication. There, we apply the compression to save costs and transmission time. If the compression works well, we can transmit routes even when the bandwidth is low. Although we have not evaluated our ideas with realistic data yet, they are quite promising.',

	{'abstract': u"Generic quantum search algorithm searches for target entity in an unsorted database by repeatedly applying canonical Grover's quantum rotation transform to reach near the vicinity of the target entity represented by a basis state in the Hilbert space associated with the qubits. Thus, when qubits are measured, there is a high probability of finding the target entity. However, the number of times quantum rotation transform is to be applied for reaching near the vicinity of the target is a function of the number of target entities present in the unsorted database, which is generally unknown. A wrong estimate of the number of target entities can lead to overshooting or undershooting the targets, thus reducing the success probability. Some proposals have been made to overcome this limitation. These proposals either employ quantum counting to estimate the number of solutions or fixed point schemes. This paper proposes a new scheme for stopping the application of quantum rotation transformation on reaching near the targets by measurement and subsequent processing to estimate the distance of the state vector from the target states. It ensures a success probability, which is at least greater than half for all the ratios of the number of target entities to the total number of entities in a database, which are less than half. The search problem is trivial for remaining possible ratios. The proposed scheme is simpler than quantum counting and more efficient than the known fixed-point schemes. It has same order of computational complexity as canonical Grover's search algorithm but is slow by a factor of two and requires an additional ancilla qubit.",

	{'abstract': u'Predicate abstraction is a key enabling technology for applying finite-state model checkers to programs written in mainstream languages. It has been used very successfully for debugging sequential system-level C code. Although model checking was originally designed for analyzing concurrent systems, there is little evidence of fruitful applications of predicate abstraction to shared-variable concurrent software. The goal of this paper is to close this gap. We have developed a symmetry-aware predicate abstraction strategy: it takes into account the replicated structure of C programs that consist of many threads executing the same procedure, and generates a Boolean program template whose multi-threaded execution soundly overapproximates the concurrent C program. State explosion during model checking parallel instantiations of this template can now be absorbed by exploiting symmetry. We have implemented our method in the SATABS predicate abstraction framework, and demonstrate its superior performance over alternative approaches on a large range of synchronization programs.',

In this paper, we present new directions of progress in the problem. More specifically, we propose a family of mathematical programs, that depend upon a parameter , and is an extension of the uniform version of the SDPs proposed by Goemans and Linial for this problem. In fact for the case, when , if one can solve this program in polynomial time then simply using the Goemans-Williamson's randomized rounding algorithm for cite will give an -factor approximation algorithm for improving the best known approximation factor of due to Arora, Rao and Vazirani cite. This family of programs is not convex but one can transform them into so called emph in which one optimizes a concave function over a convex feasible set. It is well known that the optima of such programs lie at one of the extreme points of the feasible set cite. Our main contribution is a combinatorial characterization of some extreme points of the feasible set of the mathematical program, for case, which to the best of our knowledge is the first of its kind. We further demonstrate how this characterization can be used to solve the program in a restricted setting.

	{'abstract': u'Canonical inference rules and canonical systems are defined in the framework of non-strict single-conclusion sequent systems, in which the succeedents of sequents can be empty. Important properties of this framework are investigated, and a general non-deterministic Kripke-style semantics is provided. This general semantics is then used to provide a constructive (and very natural), sufficient and necessary coherence criterion for the validity of the strong cut-elimination theorem in such a system. These results suggest new syntactic and semantic characterizations of basic constructive connectives.',

	{'abstract': u'We give a new algorithm for Unique Games which is based on purely techniques, in contrast to previous work in the area, which relies heavily on semidefinite programming (SDP). Given a highly satisfiable instance of Unique Games, our algorithm is able to recover a good assignment. The approximation guarantee depends only on the completeness of the game, and not on the alphabet size, while the running time depends on spectral properties of the graph associated with the instance of Unique Games. We further show that on input the integrality gap instance of Khot and Vishnoi, our algorithm runs in quasi-polynomial time and decides that the instance if highly unsatisfiable. Notably, when run on this instance, the standard SDP relaxation of Unique Games . As a special case, we also re-derive a polynomial time algorithm for Unique Games on expander constraint graphs. The main ingredient of our algorithm is a technique to effectively use the full spectrum of the underlying graph instead of just the second eigenvalue, which is of independent interest. The question of how to take advantage of the full spectrum of a graph in the design of algorithms has been often studied, but no significant progress was made prior to this work.',

	{'abstract': u'For many practical applications of ASP, for instance data integration or planning, query answering is important, and therefore query optimization techniques for ASP are of great interest. Magic Sets are one of these techniques, originally defined for Datalog queries (ASP without disjunction and negation). Dynamic Magic Sets (DMS) are an extension of this technique, which has been proved to be sound and complete for query answering over ASP programs with stratified negation. A distinguishing feature of DMS is that the optimization can be exploited also during the nondeterministic phase of ASP engines. In particular, after some assumptions have been made during the computation, parts of the program may become irrelevant to a query under these assumptions. This allows for dynamic pruning of the search space, which may result in exponential performance gains. In this paper, the correctness of DMS is formally established and proved for brave and cautious reasoning over the class of super-consistent ASP programs (ASP^ programs). ASP^ programs guarantee consistency (i.e., have answer sets) when an arbitrary set of facts is added to them. This result generalizes the applicability of DMS, since the class of ASP^ programs is richer than ASP programs with stratified negation, and in particular includes all odd-cycle-free programs. DMS has been implemented as an extension of DLV, and the effectiveness of DMS for ASP^ programs is empirically confirmed by experimental results with this system.',

	{'abstract': u'Current handoffs are not designed to achieve multiple desirable features simultaneously. This weakness has resulted in handoff schemes that are seamless but not adaptive, or adaptive but not secure, or secure but not autonomous, or autonomous but not correct, etc. To face this limitation, we initiated a research project to develop a new kind of handoff system which attains multiple purposes simultaneously by using context information from the external and internal handoff environment. We envision a cognitive handoff as a multipurpose, multi-criteria, environment-aware, and policy-based handoff that trades-off multiple objectives to reach its intended goals. This paper presents a conceptual (soft) model of cognitive handoffs using a holistic approach. We applied the proposed model to identify cognitive handoff performance parameters and tradeoffs between conflicting objectives. We argue that cognitive handoffs are the archetype of handoffs for the future Internet.',

In this paper, we discuss the difficulties of developing cognitive handoffs and propose a new model-driven methodology for their systematic development. The theoretical framework of this methodology is the holistic approach, the functional decomposition method, the model-based design paradigm, and the theory of design as scientific problem-solving. We applied the proposed methodology and obtained the following results: (i) a correspondence between handoff purposes and quantitative environment information, (ii) a novel taxonomy of handoff mobility scenarios, and (iii) an original state-based model representing the functional behavior of the handoff process.',

The proposed algorithm is referred to as ANFIS Dead Reckoning, which stands for Adaptive Neuro-based Fuzzy Inference System Dead Reckoning is based on a fuzzy inference system which is trained by the learning algorithm derived from the neuronal networks and fuzzy inference theory.

	{'abstract': u'A game theoretic framework is presented to analyze the problem of finding the optimal number of data streams to transmit in a multi-user MIMO scenario, where both the transmitters and receivers are equipped with multiple antennas. Without channel state information (CSI) at any transmitter, and using outage capacity as the utility function with zero-forcing receiver, each user is shown to transmit a single data stream at Nash equilibrium in the presence of sufficient number of users. Transmitting a single data stream is also shown to be optimal in terms of maximizing the sum of the outage capacities in the presence of sufficient number of users. With CSI available at each transmitter, and using the number of successful bits per Joule of energy as the utility function, at Nash equilibrium, each user is shown to transmit a single data stream on the best eigen-mode that requires the least transmit power to achieve a fixed signal-to-interference ratio. Using the concept of locally gross direction preserving maps, existence of Nash equilibrium is shown when the number of successful bits per Joule of energy is used as the utility function.',

	{'abstract': u'We investigate projection methods, for evaluating a linear approximation of the value function of a policy in a Markov Decision Process context. We consider two popular approaches, the one-step Temporal Difference fix-point computation (TD(0)) and the Bellman Residual (BR) minimization. We describe examples, where each method outperforms the other. We highlight a simple relation between the objective function they minimize, and show that while BR enjoys a performance guarantee, TD(0) does not in general. We then propose a unified view in terms of oblique projections of the Bellman equation, which substantially simplifies and extends the characterization of (schoknecht,2002) and the recent analysis of (Yu &amp; Bertsekas, 2008). Eventually, we describe some simulations that suggest that if the TD(0) solution is usually slightly better than the BR solution, its inherent numerical instability makes it very bad in some cases, and thus worse on average.',

	{'abstract': u'If a game has a Nash equilibrium with probability values that are either zero or Omega(1) then this equilibrium can be found exhaustively in polynomial time. Somewhat surprisingly, we show that there is a PTAS for the games whose equilibria are guaranteed to have small-O(1/n)-values, and therefore large-Omega(n)-supports. We also point out that there is a PTAS for games with sparse payoff matrices, which are known to be PPAD-complete to solve exactly. Both algorithms are of a special kind that we call oblivious: The algorithm just samples a fixed distribution on pairs of mixed strategies, and the game is only used to determine whether the sampled strategies comprise an eps-Nash equilibrium; the answer is yes with inverse polynomial probability. These results bring about the question: Is there an oblivious PTAS for Nash equilibrium in general games? We answer this question in the negative; our lower bound comes close to the quasi-polynomial upper bound of [Lipton, Markakis, Mehta 2003]. Another recent PTAS for anonymous games is also oblivious in a weaker sense appropriate for this class of games (it samples from a fixed distribution on unordered collections of mixed strategies), but its runtime is exponential in 1/eps. We prove that any oblivious PTAS for anonymous games with two strategies and three player types must have 1/eps^c in the exponent of the running time for some c&gt;1/3, rendering the algorithm in [Daskalakis 2008] essentially optimal within oblivious algorithms. In contrast, we devise a poly(n) (1/eps)^O(log^2(1/eps)) non-oblivious PTAS for anonymous games with 2 strategies and any bounded number of player types. Our algorithm is based on the construction of a sparse (and efficiently computable) eps-cover of the set of all possible sums of n independent indicators, under the total variation distance. The size of the cover is poly(n) (1/ eps^.',

	{'abstract': u'This volume contains the proceedings of the Sixth International Workshop on Computing with Terms and Graphs (TERMGRAPH 2011). The workshop took place in Saarbruecken, Germany, on April 2nd, 2011, as part of the fourteenth edition of the European Joint Conferences on Theory and Practice of Software (ETAPS 2011). Research in term and graph rewriting ranges from theoretical questions to practical issues. Computing with graphs handles the sharing of common subexpressions in a natural and seamless way, and improves the efficiency of computations in space and time. Sharing is ubiquitous in several research areas, for instance : the modelling of first- and higher-order term rewriting by (acyclic or cyclic) graph rewriting, the modelling of biological or chemical abstract machines, the implementation techniques of programming languages. Term graphs are also used in automated theorem proving and symbolic computation systems working on shared structures. The aim of this workshop is to bring together researchers working in different domains on term and graph transformation and to foster their interaction, to provide a forum for presenting new ideas and work in progress, and to enable newcomers to learn about current activities in term graph rewriting. These proceedings contain six accepted papers and the abstracts of three invited talks. All submissions were subject to careful refereeing. The topics of accepted papers range over a wide spectrum, including theoretical aspects of term graph rewriting, proof methods, semantics as well as application issues of term graph transformation.',

	{'abstract': u"This paper surveys recent work in applying ideas from graphical models and message passing algorithms to solve large scale regularized regression problems. In particular, the focus is on compressed sensing reconstruction via ell_1 penalized least-squares (known as LASSO or BPDN). We discuss how to derive fast approximate message passing algorithms to solve this problem. Surprisingly, the analysis of such algorithms allows to prove exact high-dimensional limit results for the LASSO risk. This paper will appear as a chapter in a book on `Compressed Sensing' edited by Yonina Eldar and Gitta Kutyniok.",

	{'abstract': u'The use of programming languages such as Java and C in Open Source Software (OSS) has been well studied. However, many other popular languages such as XSL or XML have received minor attention. In this paper, we discuss some trends in OSS development that we observed when considering multiple programming language evolution of OSS. Based on the revision data of 22 OSS projects, we tracked the evolution of language usage and other artefacts such as documentation files, binaries and graphics files. In these systems several different languages and artefact types including C/C++, Java, XML, XSL, Makefile, Groovy, HTML, Shell scripts, CSS, Graphics files, JavaScript, JSP, Ruby, Phyton, XQuery, OpenDocument files, PHP, etc. have been used. We found that the amount of code written in different languages differs substantially. Some of our findings can be summarized as follows: (1) JavaScript and CSS files most often co-evolve with XSL; (2) Most Java developers but only every second C/C++ developer work with XML; (3) and more generally, we observed a significant increase of usage of XML and XSL during recent years and found that Java or C are hardly ever the only language used by a developer. In fact, a developer works with more than 5 different artefact types (or 4 different languages) in a project on average.',

	{'abstract': u'The eigenvalues of matrices representing the structure of large-scale complex networks present a wide range of applications, from the analysis of dynamical processes taking place in the network to spectral techniques aiming to rank the importance of nodes in the network. A common approach to study the relationship between the structure of a network and its eigenvalues is to use synthetic random networks in which structural properties of interest, such as degree distributions, are prescribed. Although very common, synthetic models present two major flaws: ( emph) These models are only suitable to study a very limited range of structural properties, and ( emph) they implicitly induce structural properties that are not directly controlled and can deceivingly influence the network eigenvalue spectrum. In this paper, we propose an alternative approach to overcome these limitations. Our approach is not based on synthetic models, instead, we use algebraic graph theory and convex optimization to study how structural properties influence the spectrum of eigenvalues of the network. Using our approach, we can compute with low computational overhead global spectral properties of a network from its local structural properties. We illustrate our approach by studying how structural properties of online social networks influence their eigenvalue spectra.',

The model is based on Wasserstein distance between interval valued data which is generalized to fuzzy data. In addition, Keller's approach is used to identify outliers and reduce their influences. We have also defined a transformation to change our distance to the Euclidean distance. With the help of this approach, the problem of fuzzy clustering of fuzzy data is reduced to fuzzy clustering of crisp data. In order to show the performance of the proposed clustering algorithm, two simulation experiments are discussed.",

	{'abstract': u'We investigate the secure connectivity of wireless sensor networks under the pairwise key distribution scheme of Chan et al.. Unlike recent work which was carried out under the assumption of full visibility, here we assume a (simplified) communication model where unreliable wireless links are represented as on/off channels. We present conditions on how to scale the model parameters so that the network i) has no secure node which is isolated and ii) is securely connected, both with high probability when the number of sensor nodes becomes large. The results are given in the form of zero-one laws, and exhibit significant differences with corresponding results in the full visibility case. Through simulations these zero-one laws are shown to be valid also under a more realistic communication model, i.e., the disk model.',

	{'abstract': u'We introduce a new technique for proving kernelization lower bounds, called cross-composition. A classical problem L cross-composes into a parameterized problem Q if an instance of Q with polynomially bounded parameter value can express the logical OR of a sequence of instances of L. Building on work by Bodlaender et al. (ICALP 2008) and using a result by Fortnow and Santhanam (STOC 2008) we show that if an NP-complete problem cross-composes into a parameterized problem Q then Q does not admit a polynomial kernel unless the polynomial hierarchy collapses. Our technique generalizes and strengthens the recent techniques of using OR-composition algorithms and of transferring the lower bounds via polynomial parameter transformations. We show its applicability by proving kernelization lower bounds for a number of important graphs problems with structural (non-standard) parameterizations, e.g., Chromatic Number, Clique, and Weighted Feedback Vertex Set do not admit polynomial kernels with respect to the vertex cover number of the input graphs unless the polynomial hierarchy collapses, contrasting the fact that these problems are trivially fixed-parameter tractable for this parameter. We have similar lower bounds for Feedback Vertex Set.',

	{'abstract': u'Memoryless channels with synchronization errors as defined by a stochastic channel matrix allowing for symbol insertions and deletions in addition to random errors are considered. Such channels are information stable, hence their Shannon capacity exists. However, computation of the channel capacity is formidable, and only some upper and lower bounds on the capacity (for some special cases) exist. In this short paper, using a simple methodology, we prove that the channel capacity is a convex function of the stochastic channel matrix. Since the more widely studied model of an independent identically distributed (i.i.d.) deletion channel is a particular case, as an immediate corollary to this result we also argue that the i.i.d. deletion channel capacity is a convex function of the deletion probability. We further use this result to improve the existing capacity upper bounds on the deletion channel by a proper "convexification" argument. In particular, we prove that the capacity of the deletion channel, as the deletion probability d --&gt; 1, is upper bounded by (which was also observed by a different (weaker) recent result).',

	{'abstract': u'Distributed search problems are ubiquitous in Artificial Life (ALife). Many distributed search problems require identifying a rare and previously unseen event and producing a rapid response. This challenge amounts to finding and removing an unknown needle in a very large haystack. Traditional computational search models are unlikely to find, nonetheless, appropriately respond to, novel events, particularly given data distributed across multiple platforms in a variety of formats and sources with variable and unknown reliability. Biological systems have evolved solutions to distributed search and response under uncertainty. Immune systems and ant colonies efficiently scale up massively parallel search with automated response in highly dynamic environments, and both do so using distributed coordination without centralized control. These properties are relevant to ALife, where distributed, autonomous, robust and adaptive control is needed to design robot swarms, mobile computing networks, computer security systems and other distributed intelligent systems. They are also relevant for searching, tracking the spread of ideas, and understanding the impact of innovations in online social networks. We review design principles for Scalable Robust, Adaptive, Decentralized search with Automated Response (Scalable RADAR) in biology. We discuss how biological RADAR scales up efficiently, and then discuss in detail how modular search in the immune system can be mimicked or built upon in ALife. Such search mechanisms are particularly useful when components have limited capacity to communicate and social or physical distance makes long distance communication more costly.',

Initial requirements of a 25-MHz conversion rate and 8-bits of resolution where the only given ones. Although additional secondary goals such as low power consumption and small area were stated. The architecture is based on a 1.5 bit per stage structure utilizing digital correction for each stage [12]. A differential switched capacitor circuit consisting of a cascade gm-C op-amp with 200MHz ft is used for sampling and amplification in each stage [12]. Differential dynamic comparators are used to implement the decision levels required for the 1.5-b per stage structure. Correction of the pipeline is accomplished by using digital correction circuit consist of D-latches and full-adders. Area and Power consumption of whole design was 0.24mm2 and 35mW respectively. The maximum sample rate at which the converter gave an adequate output was 33MHz.',

	{'abstract': u"The origin of Malagasy DNA is half African and half Indonesian, nevertheless the Malagasy language, spoken by the entire population, belongs to the Austronesian family. The language most closely related to Malagasy is Maanyan (Greater Barito East group of the Austronesian family), but related languages are also in Sulawesi, Malaysia and Sumatra. For this reason, and because Maanyan is spoken by a population which lives along the Barito river in Kalimantan and which does not possess the necessary skill for long maritime navigation, the ethnic composition of the Indonesian colonizers is still unclear. There is a general consensus that Indonesian sailors reached Madagascar by a maritime trek, but the time, the path and the landing area of the first colonization are all disputed. In this research we try to answer these problems together with other ones, such as the historical configuration of Malagasy dialects, by types of analysis related to lexicostatistics and glottochronology which draw upon the automated method recently proposed by the authors cite. The data were collected by the first author at the beginning of 2010 with the invaluable help of Joselin `a Soafara N 'er 'e and consist of Swadesh lists of 200 items for 23 dialects covering all areas of the Island.",

Objects can be involved in forward movements and rotation; they can be resized and reconfigured; all these movements and situations are considered. On the basis of total movability, the new type of programs - user-driven applications - are designed. These applications continue to work according to their main purposes, but the whole control of WHAT, WHEN, and HOW must appear on the screen is passed from designers to users. Due to the size restriction used on CoRR, the book is divided here into two parts and one appendix is deleted.

	{'abstract': u'Spectrum management has been identified as a crucial step towards enabling the technology of the cognitive radio network (CRN). Most of the current works dealing with spectrum management in the CRN focus on a single task of the problem, e.g., spectrum sensing, spectrum decision, spectrum sharing or spectrum mobility. In this work, we argue that for certain network configurations, jointly performing several tasks of the spectrum management improves the spectrum efficiency. Specifically, we study the uplink resource management problem in a CRN where there exist multiple cognitive users (CUs) and access points (APs), with each AP operates on a set of non-overlapping channels. The CUs, in order to maximize their uplink transmission rates, have to associate to a suitable AP (spectrum decision), and to share the channels belong to this AP with other CUs (spectrum sharing). These tasks are clearly interdependent, and the problem of how they should be carried out efficiently and distributedly is still open in the literature. In this work we formulate this joint spectrum decision and spectrum sharing problem into a non-cooperative game, in which the feasible strategy of a player contains a discrete variable and a continuous vector. The structure of the game is hence very different from most non-cooperative spectrum management game proposed in the literature. We provide characterization of the Nash Equilibrium (NE) of this game, and present a set of novel algorithms that allow the CUs to distributively and efficiently select the suitable AP and share the channels with other CUs. Finally, we study the properties of the proposed algorithms as well as their performance via extensive simulations.',

	{'abstract': u'To harness the ever growing capacity and decreasing cost of storage, providing an abstraction of dependable storage in the presence of crash-stop and Byzantine failures is compulsory. We propose a decentralized Reed Solomon coding mechanism with minimum communication overhead. Using a progressive data retrieval scheme, a data collector contacts only the necessary number of storage nodes needed to guarantee data integrity. The scheme gracefully adapts the cost of successful data retrieval to the number of storage node failures. Moreover, by leveraging the Welch-Berlekamp algorithm, it avoids unnecessary computations. Compared to the state-of-the-art decoding scheme, the implementation and evaluation results show that our progressive data retrieval scheme has up to 35 times better computation performance for low Byzantine node rates. Additionally, the communication cost in data retrieval is derived analytically and corroborated by Monte-Carlo simulation results. Our implementation is flexible in that the level of redundancy it provides is independent of the number of data generating nodes, a requirement for distributed storage systems',

We investigate the influence of common attributes at the dyad level in terms of assortativity coefficients and regression models. We then examine larger-scale groupings by detecting communities algorithmically and comparing them to network partitions based on the user characteristics. We thereby compare the relative importances of different characteristics at different institutions, finding for example that common high school is more important to the social organization of large institutions and that the importance of common major varies significantly between institutions. Our calculations illustrate how microscopic and macroscopic perspectives give complementary insights on the social organization at universities and suggest future studies to investigate such phenomena further.',

	{'abstract': u"This paper discusses clustering and latent semantic indexing (LSI) aspects of the singular value decomposition (SVD). The purpose of this paper is twofold. The first is to give an explanation on how and why the singular vectors can be used in clustering. And the second is to show that the two seemingly unrelated SVD aspects actually originate from the same source: related vertices tend to be more clustered in the graph representation of lower rank approximate matrix using the SVD than in the original semantic graph. Accordingly, the SVD can improve retrieval performance of an information retrieval system since queries made to the approximate matrix can retrieve more relevant documents and filter out more irrelevant documents than the same queries made to the original matrix. By utilizing this fact, we will devise an LSI algorithm that mimicks SVD capability in clustering related vertices. Convergence analysis shows that the algorithm is convergent and produces a unique solution for each input. Experimental results using some standard datasets in LSI research show that retrieval performances of the algorithm are comparable to the SVD's. In addition, the algorithm is more practical and easier to use because there is no need to determine decomposition rank which is crucial in driving retrieval performance of the SVD.",

A new generation of distributed applications, such as telemedicine and e-commerce applications, are being deployed in heterogeneous and ubiquitous computing environments. The objective of this paper is to explore an applicability of a component based services in ubiquitous computational environment. While the fundamental structure of various distributed object components is similar, there are differences that can profoundly impact an application developer or the administrator of a distributed simulation exercise and to implement in Ubiquitous Computing Environment.',

	{'abstract': u'In the past, we have observed several large blackouts, i.e. loss of power to large areas. It has been noted by several researchers that these large blackouts are a result of a cascade of failures of various components. As a power grid is made up of several thousands or even millions of components (relays, breakers, transformers, etc.), it is quite plausible that a few of these components do not perform their function as desired. Their failure/misbehavior puts additional burden on the working components causing them to misbehave, and thus leading to a cascade of failures. The complexity of the entire power grid makes it difficult to model each and every individual component and study the stability of the entire system. For this reason, it is often the case that abstract models of the working of the power grid are constructed and then analyzed. These models need to be computationally tractable while serving as a reasonable model for the entire system. In this work, we construct one such model for the power grid, and analyze it.',

	{'abstract': u'In spite of the recent improvements in the performance of the solvers based on the DPLL procedure, it is still possible for the search algorithm to focus on the wrong areas of the search space, preventing the solver from returning a solution in an acceptable amount of time. This prospect is a real concern e.g. in an industrial setting, where users typically expect consistent performance. To overcome this problem, we propose a framework that allows learning and using domain-specific heuristics in solvers based on the DPLL procedure. The learning is done off-line, on representative instances from the target domain, and the learned heuristics are then used for choice-point selection. In this paper we focus on Answer Set Programming (ASP) solvers. In our experiments, the introduction of domain-specific heuristics improved performance on hard instances by up to 3 orders of magnitude (and 2 on average), nearly completely eliminating the cases in which the solver had to be terminated because the wait for an answer had become unacceptable.',

In this paper, we describe an innovative pedagogy using Rapid Digital Game Creation (RDGC) for learning CT skills. RDGC involves the rapid building of digital games with high-level software that requires little or no programming knowledge. We analyze how RDGC supports various CT concepts and how it may be mapped to equivalent Java concepts by building the same game using both RDGC and Java. We discuss the potential benefits of this approach for attracting computing majors, as a precursor to learning formal programming languages, for learning domain knowledge, and for bridging the digital divide.

	{'abstract': u'Predicting the occurrence of links is a fundamental problem in networks. In the link prediction problem we are given a snapshot of a network and would like to infer which interactions among existing members are likely to occur in the near future or which existing interactions are we missing. Although this problem has been extensively studied, the challenge of how to effectively combine the information from the network structure with rich node and edge attribute data remains largely open. We develop an algorithm based on Supervised Random Walks that naturally combines the information from the network structure with node and edge level attributes. We achieve this by using these attributes to guide a random walk on the graph. We formulate a supervised learning task where the goal is to learn a function that assigns strengths to edges in the network such that a random walker is more likely to visit the nodes to which new links will be created in the future. We develop an efficient training algorithm to directly learn the edge strength estimation function. Our experiments on the Facebook social graph and large collaboration networks show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised approaches as well as approaches that are based on feature extraction.',

	{'abstract': u'Resource-bounded measure is a generalization of classical Lebesgue measure that is useful in computational complexity. The central parameter of resource-bounded measure is the , which is a class of functions. When is unrestricted, i.e., contains all functions with the specified domains and codomains, resource-bounded measure coincides with classical Lebesgue measure. On the other hand, when contains functions satisfying some complexity constraint, resource-bounded measure imposes internal measure structure on a corresponding complexity class. Most applications of resource-bounded measure use only the "measure-zero/measure-one fragment" of the theory. For this fragment, can be taken to be a class of type-one functions (e.g., from strings to rationals). However, in the full theory of resource-bounded measurability and measure, the resource bound also contains type-two functionals. To date, both the full theory and its zero-one fragment have been developed in terms of a list of example resource bounds chosen for their apparent utility. This paper replaces this list-of-examples approach with a careful investigation of the conditions that suffice for a class to be a resource bound. Our main theorem says that every class that has the closure properties of Mehlhorn\'s basic feasible functionals is a resource bound for measure. We also prove that the type-2 versions of the time and space hierarchies that have been extensively used in resource-bounded measure have these closure properties. In the course of doing this, we prove theorems establishing that these time and space resource bounds are all robust.',

	{'abstract': u'We describe a model for capturing the statistical structure of local amplitude and local spatial phase in natural images. The model is based on a recently developed, factorized third-order Boltzmann machine that was shown to be effective at capturing higher-order structure in images by modeling dependencies among squared filter outputs (Ranzato and Hinton, 2010). Here, we extend this model to -spherically symmetric subspaces. In order to model local amplitude and phase structure in images, we focus on the case of two dimensional subspaces, and the -norm. When trained on natural images the model learns subspaces resembling quadrature-pair Gabor filters. We then introduce an additional set of hidden units that model the dependencies among subspace phases. These hidden units form a combinatorial mixture of phase coupling distributions, concentrated in the sum and difference of phase pairs. When adapted to natural images, these distributions capture local spatial phase structure in natural images.',

	{'abstract': u'Multi-mode real-time systems are those which support applications with different modes of operation, where each mode is characterized by a specific set of tasks. At run-time, such systems can, at any time, be requested to switch from its current operating mode to another mode (called "new mode") by replacing the current set of tasks with that of the new-mode. Thereby, ensuring that all the timing requirements are met not only requires that a schedulability test is performed on the tasks of each mode but also that (i) a protocol for transitioning from one mode to another is specified and (ii) a schedulability test for each transition is performed. We propose two distinct protocols that manage the mode transitions upon uniform and identical multiprocessor platforms at run-time, each specific to distinct task requirements. For each protocol, we formally establish schedulability analyses that indicate beforehand whether all the timing requirements will be met during any mode transition of the system. This is performed assuming both Fixed-Task-Priority and Fixed-Job-Priority schedulers.',

	{'abstract': u'Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) are heuristic algorithms inspired by natural evolution. They are often used to obtain satisficing solutions in practice. In this paper, we investigate a largely underexplored issue: the approximation performance of EAs in terms of how close the solution obtained is to an optimal solution. We study an EA framework named simple EA with isolated population (SEIP) that can be implemented as a single- or multi-objective EA. We analyze the approximation performance of SEIP using the partial ratio, which characterizes the approximation ratio that can be guaranteed. Specifically, we analyze SEIP using a set cover problem that is NP-hard. We find that in a simple configuration, SEIP efficiently achieves an -approximation ratio, the asymptotic lower bound, for the unbounded set cover problem. We also find that SEIP efficiently achieves an -approximation ratio, the currently best-achievable result, for the k-set cover problem. Moreover, for an instance class of the k-set cover problem, we disclose how SEIP, using either one-bit or bit-wise mutation, can overcome the difficulty that limits the greedy algorithm.',

	{'abstract': u'Partial-monitoring games constitute a mathematical framework for sequential decision making problems with imperfect feedback: The learner repeatedly chooses an action, opponent responds with an outcome, and then the learner suffers a loss and receives a feedback signal, both of which are fixed functions of the action and the outcome. The goal of the learner is to minimize his total cumulative loss. We make progress towards the classification of these games based on their minimax expected regret. Namely, we classify almost all games with two outcomes and finite number of actions: We show that their minimax expected regret is either zero, , , or and we give a simple and efficiently computable classification of these four classes of games.

	{'abstract': u'As the recent financial crisis showed, today there is a strong need to gain "ecological perspective" of all relevant interactions in socio-economic-techno-environmental systems. For this, we suggested to set-up a network of Centers for integrative systems design, which shall be able to run all potentially relevant scenarios, identify causality chains, explore feedback and cascading effects for a number of model variants, and determine the reliability of their implications (given the validity of the underlying models). They will be able to detect possible negative side effect of policy decisions, before they occur. The Centers belonging to this network of Integrative Systems Design Centers would be focused on a particular field, but they would be part of an attempt to eventually cover all relevant areas of society and economy and integrate them within a "Living Earth Simulator". The results of all research activities of such Centers would be turned into informative input for political Decision Arenas. For example, Crisis Observatories (for financial instabilities, shortages of resources, environmental change, conflict, spreading of diseases, etc.) would be connected with such Decision Arenas for the purpose of visualization, in order to make complex interdependencies understandable to scientists, decision-makers, and the general public.',

	{'abstract': u'We consider lattice tilings of by a shape we call a -quasi-cross. Such lattices form perfect error-correcting codes which correct a single limited-magnitude error with prescribed maximal-magnitudes of positive error and negative error (the ratio of which is called the balance ratio). These codes can be used to correct both disturb and retention errors in flash memories, which are characterized by having limited magnitudes and different signs. We construct infinite families of perfect codes for any rational balance ratio, and provide a specific construction for -quasi-cross lattice tiling. The constructions are related to group splitting and modular sequences. We also study bounds on the parameters of lattice-tilings by quasi-crosses, connecting the arm lengths of the quasi-crosses and the dimension. We also prove constraints on group splitting, a specific case of which shows that the parameters of the lattice tiling of -quasi-crosses is the only ones possible.',

	{'abstract': u'We prove several decidability and undecidability results for nu-PN, an extension of P/T nets with pure name creation and name management. We give a simple proof of undecidability of reachability, by reducing reachability in nets with inhibitor arcs to it. Thus, the expressive power of nu-PN strictly surpasses that of P/T nets. We prove that nu-PN are Well Structured Transition Systems. In particular, we obtain decidability of coverability and termination, so that the expressive power of Turing machines is not reached. Moreover, they are strictly Well Structured, so that the boundedness problem is also decidable. We consider two properties, width-boundedness and depth-boundedness, that factorize boundedness. Width-boundedness has already been proven to be decidable. We prove here undecidability of depth-boundedness. Finally, we obtain Ackermann-hardness results for all our decidable decision problems.',

Four examples are included: in the first case, the synthesis of a mechanism for hybrid-tasks, considering path generation, function generation, and motion generation, is carried out. The second and third cases pertain to path generation, with and without prescribed timing. Finally, the synthesis of an Ackerman mechanism is reported. Order defect problem is solved by manipulating individuals instead of penalizing or discretizing the search space for the parameters. A technique that consists in applying a transformation in order to satisfy the Grashof and crank conditions to generate an initial elitist population is introduced. As a result, the evolutionary algorithm increases its efficiency.',

	{'abstract': u'This paper introduces a novel method for compact representation of sets of n-dimensional binary sequences in a form of compact triplets structures (CTS), supposing both logic and arithmetic interpretations of data. Suitable illustration of CTS application is the unique graph-combinatorial model for the classic intractable 3-Satisfiability problem and a polynomial algorithm for the model synthesis. The method used for Boolean formulas analysis and classification by means of the model is defined as a bijective mapping principle for sets of components of discordant structures to a basic set. The statistic computer-aided experiment showed efficiency of the algorithm in a large scale of problem dimension parameters, including those that make enumeration procedures of no use. The formulated principle expands resources of constructive approach to investigation of intractable problems.',

	{'abstract': u'Motivated by the desire to cope with data imprecision, we study methods for taking advantage of preliminary information about point sets in order to speed up the computation of certain structures associated with them. In particular, we study the following problem: given a set L of n lines in the plane, we wish to preprocess L such that later, upon receiving a set P of n points, each of which lies on a distinct line of L, we can construct the convex hull of P efficiently. We show that in quadratic time and space it is possible to construct a data structure on L that enables us to compute the convex hull of any such point set P in O(n alpha(n) log* n) expected time. If we further assume that the points are "oblivious" with respect to the data structure, the running time improves to O(n alpha(n)). The analysis applies almost verbatim when L is a set of line-segments, and yields similar asymptotic bounds. We present several extensions, including a trade-off between space and query time and an output-sensitive algorithm. We also study the "dual problem" where we show how to efficiently compute the (&lt;= k)-level of n lines in the plane, each of which lies on a distinct point (given in advance). We complement our results by Omega(n log n) lower bounds under the algebraic computation tree model for several related problems, including sorting a set of points (according to, say, their x-order), each of which lies on a given line known in advance. Therefore, the convex hull problem under our setting is easier than sorting, contrary to the "standard" convex hull and sorting problems, in which the two problems require Theta(n log n) steps in the worst case (under the algebraic computation tree model).',

Synthesis of rather simple behaviors such as collision avoidance by applying artificial evolution has been shown multiple times. However, the difficulty of this synthesis increases heavily with increasing complexity of the task that should be performed by the robot. We try to tackle this problem of complexity with Artificial Homeostatic Hormone Systems (AHHS), which provide both intrinsic, homeostatic processes and (transient) intrinsic, variant behavior. By using AHHS the need for pre-defined controller topologies or information about the field of application is minimized. We investigate how the principle design of the controller and the hormone network size affects the overall performance of the artificial evolution (i.e., evolvability). This is done by comparing two variants of AHHS that show different effects when mutated. We evolve a controller for a robot built from five autonomous, cooperating modules. The desired behavior is a form of gait resulting in fast locomotion by using the modules' main hinges.",

	{'abstract': u'Theoretical progress in understanding the dynamics of spreading processes on graphs suggests the existence of an epidemic threshold below which no epidemics form and above which epidemics spread to a significant fraction of the graph. We have observed information cascades on the social media site Digg that spread fast enough for one initial spreader to infect hundreds of people, yet end up affecting only 0.1% of the entire network. We find that two effects, previously studied in isolation, combine cooperatively to drastically limit the final size of cascades on Digg. First, because of the highly clustered structure of the Digg network, most people who are aware of a story have been exposed to it via multiple friends. This structure lowers the epidemic threshold while moderately slowing the overall growth of cascades. In addition, we find that the mechanism for social contagion on Digg points to a fundamental difference between information spread and other contagion processes: despite multiple opportunities for infection within a social group, people are less likely to become spreaders of information with repeated exposure. The consequences of this mechanism become more pronounced for more clustered graphs. Ultimately, this effect severely curtails the size of social epidemics on Digg.',

In this second part of the paper, we build upon our previous understanding of the single AP network, and formulate the joint spectrum decision and spectrum sharing problem in a multiple AP network into a non-cooperative game, in which the feasible strategy of a player contains a discrete variable (the AP/spectrum decision) and a continuous vector (the power allocation among multiple channels). The structure of the game is hence very different from most non-cooperative spectrum management game proposed in the literature. We provide characterization of the Nash Equilibrium (NE) of this game, and present a set of novel algorithms that allow the CUs to distributively and efficiently select the suitable AP and share the channels with other CUs.

By enabling nodes to detect malicious behaviors probabilistically and use overheard messages to police their downstream neighbors locally, the algebraic watchdog delivers a secure global self-checking network. Unlike traditional Byzantine detection protocols which are receiver-based, this protocol gives the senders an active role in checking the node downstream. The key idea is inspired by Marti et al.'s watchdog-pathrater, which attempts to detect and mitigate the effects of routing misbehavior. As an initial building block of a such system, we first focus on a two-hop network. We present a graphical model to understand the inference process nodes execute to police their downstream neighbors; as well as to compute, analyze, and approximate the probabilities of misdetection and false detection. In addition, we present an algebraic analysis of the performance using an hypothesis testing framework that provides exact formulae for probabilities of false detection and misdetection. We then extend the algebraic watchdog to a more general network setting, and propose a protocol in which we can establish trust in coded systems in a distributed manner. We develop a graphical model to detect the presence of an adversarial node downstream within a general multi-hop network. The structure of the graphical model (a trellis) lends itself to well-known algorithms, such as the Viterbi algorithm, which can compute the probabilities of misdetection and false detection. We show analytically that as long as the min-cut is not dominated by the Byzantine adversaries, upstream nodes can monitor downstream neighbors and allow reliable communication with certain probability. Finally, we present simulation results that support our analysis.",

	{'abstract': u'The convergence properties of the Iterative water-filling (IWF) based algorithms have been derived in the ideal situation where the transmitters in the network are able to obtain the exact value of the interference plus noise (IPN) experienced at the corresponding receivers in each iteration of the algorithm. However, these algorithms are not robust because they diverge when there is it time-varying estimation error of the IPN, a situation that arises in real communication system. In this correspondence, we propose an algorithm that possesses convergence guarantees in the presence of various forms of such time-varying error. Moreover, we also show by simulation that in scenarios where the interference is strong, the conventional IWF diverges while our proposed algorithm still converges.',

	{'abstract': u'This paper studies the capacity of single-source single-sink noiseless networks under adversarial or arbitrary errors on no more than z edges. Unlike prior papers, which assume equal capacities on all links, arbitrary link capacities are considered. Results include new upper bounds, network error correction coding strategies, and examples of network families where our bounds are tight. An example is provided of a network where the capacity is 50% greater than the best rate that can be achieved with linear coding. While coding at the source and sink suffices in networks with equal link capacities, in networks with unequal link capacities, it is shown that intermediate nodes may have to do coding, nonlinear error detection, or error correction in order to achieve the network error correction capacity.',

	{'abstract': u'Spectrum management has been identified as a crucial step towards enabling the technology of a cognitive radio network (CRN). Most of the current works dealing with spectrum management in the CRN focus on a single task of the problem, e.g., spectrum sensing, spectrum decision, spectrum sharing or spectrum mobility. In this two-part paper, we argue that for certain network configurations, jointly performing several tasks of the spectrum management improves the spectrum efficiency. Specifically, our aim is to study the uplink resource management problem in a CRN where there exist multiple cognitive users (CUs) and access points (APs). The CUs, in order to maximize their uplink transmission rates, have to associate to a suitable AP (spectrum decision), and to share the channels used by this AP with other CUs (spectrum sharing). These tasks are clearly interdependent, and the problem of how they should be carried out efficiently and in a distributed manner is still open in the literature.',

	{'abstract': u'This paper focuses on two-cell multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) Gaussian interfering broadcast channels (MIMO-IFBC) with cooperating users on the cell-boundary of each BS. It corresponds to a downlink scenario for cellular networks with two base stations (BSs), and users equipped with Wi-Fi interfaces enabling to cooperate among users on a peer-to-peer basis. In this scenario, we propose a novel interference alignment (IA) technique exploiting user cooperation. Our proposed algorithm obtains the achievable degrees of freedom (DoF) of 2K when each BS and user have transmit antennas and receive antennas, respectively. Furthermore, the algorithm requires only a small amount of channel feedback information with the aid of the user cooperation channels. The simulations demonstrate that not only are the analytical results valid, but the achievable DoF of our proposed algorithm also outperforms those of conventional techniques.',

	{'abstract': u'This paper introduces a simple and very general theory of compressive sensing. In this theory, the sensing mechanism simply selects sensing vectors independently at random from a probability distribution F; it includes all models - e.g. Gaussian, frequency measurements - discussed in the literature, but also provides a framework for new measurement strategies as well. We prove that if the probability distribution F obeys a simple incoherence property and an isotropy property, one can faithfully recover approximately sparse signals from a minimal number of noisy measurements. The novelty is that our recovery results do not require the restricted isometry property (RIP) - they make use of a much weaker notion - or a random model for the signal. As an example, the paper shows that a signal with s nonzero entries can be faithfully recovered from about s log n Fourier coefficients that are contaminated with noise.',

Both cosine-normalization (bottom up) and factor analysis (top down) suggest a division into approximately twelve subsets. The relations among these subsets are explored using various visualization techniques. However, we were not able to retrieve this structure using the ISI Subject Categories, including the 25 categories which are specific to the A&amp;HCI.

	{'abstract': u'In this paper we introduce the olog, or ontology log, a category-theoretic model for knowledge representation (KR). Grounded in formal mathematics, ologs can be rigorously formulated and cross-compared in ways that other KR models (such as semantic networks) cannot. An olog is similar to a relational database schema; in fact an olog can serve as a data repository if desired. Unlike database schemas, which are generally difficult to create or modify, ologs are designed to be user-friendly enough that authoring or reconfiguring an olog is a matter of course rather than a difficult chore. It is hoped that learning to author ologs is much simpler than learning a database definition language, despite their similarity. We describe ologs carefully and illustrate with many examples. As an application we show that any primitive recursive function can be described by an olog. We also show that ologs can be aligned or connected together into a larger network using functors. The various methods of information flow and institutions can then be used to integrate local and global world-views. We finish by providing several different avenues for future research.',

	{'abstract': u"A celebrated theorem of Savitch states that NSPACE(S) is contained in DSPACE(S^2). In particular, Savitch gave a deterministic algorithm to solve ST-CONNECTIVITY (an NL-complete problem) using O(log^2) space, implying NL is in DSPACE(log^2). While Savitch's theorem itself has not been improved in the last four decades, studying the space complexity of several special cases of ST-CONNECTIVITY has provided new insights into the space-bounded complexity classes. In this paper, we introduce new kind of graph connectivity problems which we call graph realizability problems. All of our graph realizability problems are generalizations of UNDIRECTED ST-CONNECTIVITY. ST-REALIZABILITY, the most general graph realizability problem, is LogCFL-complete. We define the corresponding complexity classes that lie between L and LogCFL and study their relationships. As special cases of our graph realizability problems we define two natural problems, BALANCED ST-CONNECTIVITY and POSITIVE BALANCED ST-CONNECTIVITY, that lie between L and NL. We present a deterministic O(lognloglogn) space algorithm for BALANCED ST-CONNECTIVITY. More generally we prove that SGSLogCFL, a generalization of BALANCED ST-CONNECTIVITY, is contained in DSPACE(lognloglogn). To achieve this goal we generalize several concepts (such as graph squaring and transitive closure) and algorithms (such as parallel algorithms) known in the context of UNDIRECTED ST-CONNECTIVITY.",

	{'abstract': u'We present a complete characterization of shortest paths to a goal position for a vehicle with unicycle kinematics and a limited range sensor, constantly keeping a given landmark in sight. Previous work on this subject studied the optimal paths in case of a frontal, symmetrically limited Field--Of--View (FOV). In this paper we provide a generalization to the case of arbitrary FOVs, including the case that the direction of motion is not an axis of symmetry for the FOV, and even that it is not contained in the FOV. The provided solution is of particular relevance to applications using side-scanning, such as e.g. in underwater sonar-based surveying and navigation.',

	{'abstract': u'Given a metric space on n points, an -approximate universal algorithm for the Steiner tree problem outputs a distribution over rooted spanning trees such that for any subset X of vertices containing the root, the expected cost of the induced subtree is within an factor of the optimal Steiner tree cost for X. An -approximate differentially private algorithm for the Steiner tree problem takes as input a subset X of vertices, and outputs a tree distribution that induces a solution within an factor of the optimal as before, and satisfies the additional property that for any set X\' that differs in a single vertex from X, the tree distributions for X and X\' are "close" to each other. Universal and differentially private algorithms for TSP are defined similarly. An -approximate universal algorithm for the Steiner tree problem or TSP is also an -approximate differentially private algorithm. It is known that both problems admit O(logn)-approximate universal algorithms, and hence O(log n)-approximate differentially private algorithms as well. We prove an (logn) lower bound on the approximation ratio achievable for the universal Steiner tree problem and the universal TSP, matching the known upper bounds. Our lower bound for the Steiner tree problem holds even when the algorithm is allowed to output a more general solution of a distribution on paths to the root.',

	{'abstract': u'A plausible definition of "reasoning" could be "algebraically manipulating previously acquired knowledge in order to answer a new question". This definition covers first-order logical inference or probabilistic inference. It also includes much simpler manipulations commonly used to build large learning systems. For instance, we can build an optical character recognition system by first training a character segmenter, an isolated character recognizer, and a language model, using appropriate labeled training sets. Adequately concatenating these modules and fine tuning the resulting system can be viewed as an algebraic operation in a space of models. The resulting model answers a new question, that is, converting the image of a text page into a computer readable text. This observation suggests a conceptual continuity between algebraically rich inference systems, such as logical or probabilistic inference, and simple manipulations, such as the mere concatenation of trainable learning systems. Therefore, instead of trying to bridge the gap between machine learning systems and sophisticated "all-purpose" inference mechanisms, we can instead algebraically enrich the set of manipulations applicable to training systems, and build reasoning capabilities from the ground up.',

We introduce an extensible framework that will enable the real-time analysis of meme diffusion in social media by mining, visualizing, mapping, classifying, and modeling massive streams of public microblogging events. We describe a Web service that leverages this framework to track political memes in Twitter and help detect astroturfing, smear campaigns, and other misinformation in the context of U.S. political elections. We present some cases of abusive behaviors uncovered by our service. Finally, we discuss promising preliminary results on the detection of suspicious memes via supervised learning based on features extracted from the topology of the diffusion networks, sentiment analysis, and crowdsourced annotations.',

	{'abstract': u'PDM Systems contain and manage heavy amount of data but the search mechanism of most of the systems is not intelligent which can process user"s natural language based queries to extract desired information. Currently available search mechanisms in almost all of the PDM systems are not very efficient and based on old ways of searching information by entering the relevant information to the respective fields of search forms to find out some specific information from attached repositories. Targeting this issue, a thorough research was conducted in fields of PDM Systems and Language Technology. Concerning the PDM System, conducted research provides the information about PDM and PDM Systems in detail. Concerning the field of Language Technology, helps in implementing a search mechanism for PDM Systems to search user"s needed information by analyzing user"s natural language based requests. The accomplished goal of this research was to support the field of PDM with a new proposition of a conceptual model for the implementation of natural language based search. The proposed conceptual model is successfully designed and partially implementation in the form of a prototype. Describing the proposition in detail the main concept, implementation designs and developed prototype of proposed approach is discussed in this paper. Implemented prototype is compared with respective functions of existing PDM systems .i.e., Windchill and CIM to evaluate its effectiveness against targeted challenges.',

	{'abstract': u'We present a new lossy compressor for discrete-valued sources. For coding a sequence , the encoder starts by assigning a certain cost to each possible reconstruction sequence. It then finds the one that minimizes this cost and describes it losslessly to the decoder via a universal lossless compressor. The cost of each sequence is a linear combination of its distance from the sequence and a linear function of its order empirical distribution. The structure of the cost function allows the encoder to employ the Viterbi algorithm to recover the minimizer of the cost. We identify a choice of the coefficients comprising the linear function of the empirical distribution used in the cost function which ensures that the algorithm universally achieves the optimum rate-distortion performance of any stationary ergodic source in the limit of large , provided that diverges as . Iterative techniques for approximating the coefficients, which alleviate the computational burden of finding the optimal coefficients, are proposed and studied.',

	{'abstract': u"We present a new threshold phenomenon in data structure lower bounds where slightly reduced update times lead to exploding query times. Consider incremental connectivity, letting t_u be the time to insert an edge and t_q be the query time. For t_u = Omega(t_q), the problem is equivalent to the well-understood union-find problem: InsertEdge(s,t) can be implemented by Union(Find(s), Find(t)). This gives worst-case time t_u = t_q = O(lg n / lglg n) and amortized t_u = t_q = O(alpha(n)). By contrast, we show that if t_u = o(lg n / lglg n), the query time explodes to t_q &gt;= n^. In other words, if the data structure doesn't have time to find the roots of each disjoint set (tree) during edge insertion, there is no effective way to organize the information! For amortized complexity, we demonstrate a new inverse-Ackermann type trade-off in the regime t_u = o(t_q). A similar lower bound is given for fully dynamic connectivity, where an update time of o( lg n) forces the query time to be n^. This lower bound allows for amortization and Las Vegas randomization, and comes close to the known O(lg n * poly(lglg n)) upper bound.",

	{'abstract': u'This paper provides a comprehensive review of the domain of physical layer security in multiuser wireless networks. The essential premise of physical-layer security is to enable the exchange of confidential messages over a wireless medium in the presence of unauthorized eavesdroppers without relying on higher-layer encryption. This can be achieved primarily in two ways: without the need for a secret key by intelligently designing transmit coding strategies, or by exploiting the wireless communication medium to develop secret keys over public channels. The survey begins with an overview of the foundations dating back to the pioneering work of Shannon and Wyner on information-theoretic security. We then describe the evolution of secure transmission strategies from point-to-point channels to multiple-antenna systems, followed by generalizations to multiuser broadcast, multiple-access, interference, and relay networks. Secret-key generation and establishment protocols based on physical layer mechanisms are subsequently covered. Approaches for secrecy based on channel coding design are then examined, along with a description of inter-disciplinary approaches based on game theory and stochastic geometry. The associated problem of physical-layer message authentication is also introduced briefly. The survey concludes with observations on potential research directions in this area.',

	{'abstract': u'Problems related to network coding for acyclic, instantaneous networks (where the edges of the acyclic graph representing the network are assumed to have zero-delay) have been extensively dealt with in the recent past. The most prominent of these problems include (a) the existence of network codes that achieve maximum rate of transmission, (b) efficient network code constructions, and (c) field size issues. In practice, however, networks have transmission delays. In network coding theory, such networks with transmission delays are generally abstracted by assuming that their edges have integer delays. Note that using enough memory at the nodes of an acyclic network with integer delays can effectively simulate instantaneous behavior, which is probably why only acyclic instantaneous networks have been primarily focused on thus far. In this work, we elaborate on issues ((a), (b) and (c) above) related to network coding for acyclic networks with integer delays, which have till now mostly been overlooked. We show that the delays associated with the edges of the network cannot be ignored, and in fact turn out to be advantageous, disadvantageous or immaterial, depending on the topology of the network and the problem considered i.e., (a), (b) or (c). In the process, we also show that for a single source multicast problem in acyclic networks (instantaneous and with delays), the network coding operations at each node can simply be limited to storing old symbols and coding them over a binary field. Therefore, operations over elements of larger fields are unnecessary in the network, the trade-off being that enough memory exists at the nodes and at the sinks, and that the sinks have more processing power.',

	{'abstract': u'Recently, considerable research efforts have been devoted to the design of methods to learn from data overcomplete dictionaries for sparse coding. However, learned dictionaries require the solution of an optimization problem for coding new data. In order to overcome this drawback, we propose an algorithm aimed at learning both a dictionary and its dual: a linear mapping directly performing the coding. By leveraging on proximal methods, our algorithm jointly minimizes the reconstruction error of the dictionary and the coding error of its dual; the sparsity of the representation is induced by an -based penalty on its coefficients. The results obtained on synthetic data and real images show that the algorithm is capable of recovering the expected dictionaries. Furthermore, on a benchmark dataset, we show that the image features obtained from the dual matrix yield state-of-the-art classification performance while being much less computational intensive.',

	{'abstract': u'This paper aims to identify whether different weighted PageRank algorithms can be applied to author citation networks to measure the popularity and prestige of a scholar from a citation perspective. Information Retrieval (IR) was selected as a test field and data from 1956-2008 were collected from Web of Science (WOS). Weighted PageRank with citation and publication as weighted vectors were calculated on author citation networks. The results indicate that both popularity rank and prestige rank were highly correlated with the weighted PageRank. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was conducted to detect relationships among these different measures. For capturing prize winners within the IR field, prestige rank outperformed all the other measures.',

	{'abstract': u'A mobile ad hoc network (MANET), is a self-configuring network of mobile devices connected by wireless links. In order to achieve stable clusters, the cluster-heads maintaining the cluster should be stable with minimum overhead of cluster re-elections. In this paper we propose a Probability Based Adaptive Invoked Weighted Clustering Algorithm (PAIWCA) which can enhance the stability of the clusters by taking battery power of the nodes into considerations for the clustering formation and electing stable cluster-heads using cluster head probability of a node. In this simulation study a comparison was conducted to measure the performance of our algorithm with maximal weighted independent set (MWIS) in terms of the number of clusters formed, the connectivity of the network, dominant set updates,throughput of the overall network and packet delivery ratio. The result shows that our algorithm performs better than existing one and is also tunable to different kinds of network conditions.',

	{'abstract': u'Under what conditions is an edge present in a social network at time t likely to decay or persist by some future time t + Delta(t)? Previous research addressing this issue suggests that the network range of the people involved in the edge, the extent to which the edge is embedded in a surrounding structure, and the age of the edge all play a role in edge decay. This paper uses weighted data from a large-scale social network built from cell-phone calls in an 8-week period to determine the importance of edge weight for the decay/persistence process. In particular, we study the relative predictive power of directed weight, embeddedness, newness, and range (measured as outdegree) with respect to edge decay and assess the effectiveness with which a simple decision tree and logistic regression classifier can accurately predict whether an edge that was active in one time period continues to be so in a future time period. We find that directed edge weight, weighted reciprocity and time-dependent measures of edge longevity are highly predictive of whether we classify an edge as persistent or decayed, relative to the other types of factors at the dyad and neighborhood level.',

	{'abstract': u'In this work, we study the performance of random isometric precoders over quasi-static and correlated fading channels. We derive deterministic approximations of the mutual information and the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) at the output of the minimum-mean-square-error (MMSE) receiver and provide simple provably converging fixed-point algorithms for their computation. Although these approximations are only proven exact in the asymptotic regime with infinitely many antennas at the transmitters and receivers, simulations suggest that they closely match the performance of small-dimensional systems. We exemplarily apply our results to the performance analysis of multi-cellular communication systems, multiple-input multiple-output multiple-access channels (MIMO-MAC), and MIMO interference channels. The mathematical analysis is based on the Stieltjes transform method. This enables the derivation of deterministic equivalents of functionals of large-dimensional random matrices. In contrast to previous works, our analysis does not rely on arguments from free probability theory which enables the consideration of random matrix models for which asymptotic freeness does not hold. Thus, the results of this work are also a novel contribution to the field of random matrix theory and applicable to a wide spectrum of practical systems.',

	{'abstract': u'SBV is a deep inference system that extends the set of logical operators of multiplicative linear logic with the non commutative operator Seq. We introduce the logical system SBVr which extends SBV by adding a self-dual atom-renaming operator to it. We prove that the cut elimination holds on SBVr. SBVr and its cut free subsystem BVr are complete and sound with respect to linear lambda calculus with explicit substitutions. Under any strategy, a sequence of evaluation steps of any linear lambda-term M becomes a process of proof-search in SBVr (BVr) once M is mapped into a formula of SBVr. Completeness and soundness follow from simulating linear beta-reduction with explicit substitutions as processes. The role of the new renaming operator of SBVr is to rename channel-names on-demand. This simulates the substitution that occurs in a beta-reduction. Despite SBVr is a minimal extension of SBV its proof-search can compute all boolean functions, as linear lambda-calculus with explicit substitutions can compute all boolean functions as well. So, proof search of SBVr and BVr is at least ptime-complete.',

	{'abstract': u'Self-stabilizing systems have the ability to converge to a correct behavior when started in any configuration. Most of the work done so far in the self-stabilization area assumed either communication via shared memory or via FIFO channels. This paper is the first to lay the bases for the design of self-stabilizing message passing algorithms over unreliable non-FIFO channels. We propose a fault-send-deliver optimal stabilizing data-link layer that emulates a reliable FIFO communication channel over unreliable capacity bounded non-FIFO channels.',

	{'abstract': u'We investigate the recovery of signals exhibiting a sparse representation in a general (i.e., possibly redundant or incomplete) dictionary that are corrupted by additive noise admitting a sparse representation in another general dictionary. This setup covers a wide range of applications, such as image inpainting, super-resolution, signal separation, and recovery of signals that are impaired by, e.g., clipping, impulse noise, or narrowband interference. We present deterministic recovery guarantees based on a novel uncertainty relation for pairs of general dictionaries and we provide corresponding practicable recovery algorithms. The recovery guarantees we find depend on the signal and noise sparsity levels, on the coherence parameters of the involved dictionaries, and on the amount of prior knowledge about the signal and noise support sets.',

	{'abstract': u'The Resource Description Framework (RDF) provides a common data model for the integration of "real-time" social and sensor data streams with the Web and with each other. While there exist numerous protocols and data formats for exchanging dynamic RDF data, or RDF updates, these options should be examined carefully in order to enable a Semantic Web equivalent of the high-throughput, low-latency streams of typical Web 2.0, multimedia, and gaming applications. This paper contains a brief survey of RDF update formats and a high-level discussion of both TCP and UDP-based transport protocols for updates. Its main contribution is the experimental evaluation of a UDP-based architecture which serves as a real-world example of a high-performance RDF streaming application in an Internet-scale distributed environment.',

	{'abstract': u'In order to provide high data reliability, distributed storage systems disperse data with redundancy to multiple storage nodes. Regenerating codes is a new class of erasure codes to introduce redundancy for the purpose of improving the data repair performance in distributed storage. Most of the studies on regenerating codes focus on the single-failure recovery, but it is not uncommon to see two or more node failures at the same time in large storage networks. To exploit the opportunity of repairing multiple failed nodes simultaneously, a cooperative repair mechanism, in the sense that the nodes to be repaired can exchange data among themselves, is investigated. A lower bound on the repair-bandwidth for cooperative repair is derived and a construction of a family of exact cooperative regenerating codes matching this lower bound is presented.',

	{'abstract': u'It was shown recently that CSMA (Carrier Sense Multiple Access)-like distributed algorithms can achieve the maximal throughput in wireless networks (and task processing networks) under certain assumptions. One important, but idealized assumption is that the sensing time is negligible, so that there is no collision. In this paper, we study more practical CSMA-based scheduling algorithms with collisions. First, we provide a Markov chain model and give an explicit throughput formula which takes into account the cost of collisions and overhead. The formula has a simple form since the Markov chain is "almost" time-reversible. Second, we propose transmission-length control algorithms to approach throughput optimality in this case. Sufficient conditions are given to ensure the convergence and stability of the proposed algorithms. Finally, we characterize the relationship between the CSMA parameters (such as the maximum packet lengths) and the achievable capacity region.',

	{'abstract': u'In this paper, we perform a cost-benefit analysis of multiuser diversity in single antenna broadcast channels. It is well known that multiuser diversity can be beneficial but there is a significant cost associated with acquiring instantaneous CSI. We perform a cost-benefit analysis of multiuser diversity for 2 types of CSI feedback methods, dedicated feedback and SNR dependent feedback, quantifying how many users should feedback CSI from a net throughput perspective. Dedicated feedback, in which orthogonal resources are allocated to each user, has significant feedback cost and this limits the amount of available multiuser diversity that can be used. SNR dependent feedback method, in which only users with SNR above a threshold attempt to feedback, has relatively much smaller feedback cost and this allows for all of the available multiuser diversity to be used. Next, we study the effect of single user multiantenna techniques, which reduce the SNR variation, on the number of feedback users neccessary. It is seen that a broadcast channel using single user multiantenna techniques should reduce the number of feedback users with the spatial dimension.',

	{'abstract': u'This paper studies the provision of a wireless network by a monopolistic provider who may be either benevolent (seeking to maximize social welfare) or selfish (seeking to maximize provider profit). The paper addresses questions that do not seem to have been studied before in the engineering literature on wireless networks: Under what circumstances is it feasible for a provider, either benevolent or selfish, to operate a network in such a way as to cover costs? How is the optimal behavior of a benevolent provider different from the optimal behavior of a selfish provider, and how does this difference affect social welfare? And, most importantly, how does the medium access control (MAC) technology influence the answers to these questions? To address these questions, we build a general model, and provide analysis and simulations for simplified but typical scenarios; the focus in these scenarios is on the contrast between the outcomes obtained under carrier-sensing multiple access (CSMA) and outcomes obtained under time-division multiple access (TDMA). Simulation results demonstrate that differences in MAC technology can have a significant effect on social welfare, on provider profit, and even on the (financial) feasibility of a wireless network.',

	{'abstract': u'How does information flow in online social networks? How does the structure and size of the information cascade evolve in time? How can we efficiently mine the information contained in cascade dynamics? We approach these questions empirically and present an efficient and scalable mathematical framework for quantitative analysis of cascades on networks. We define a cascade generating function that captures the details of the microscopic dynamics of the cascades. We show that this function can also be used to compute the macroscopic properties of cascades, such as their size, spread, diameter, number of paths, and average path length. We present an algorithm to efficiently compute cascade generating function and demonstrate that while significantly compressing information within a cascade, it nevertheless allows us to accurately reconstruct its structure. We use this framework to study information dynamics on the social network of Digg. Digg allows users to post and vote on stories, and easily see the stories that friends have voted on. As a story spreads on Digg through voting, it generates cascades. We extract cascades of more than 3,500 Digg stories and calculate their macroscopic and microscopic properties. We identify several trends in cascade dynamics: spreading via chaining, branching and community. We discuss how these affect the spread of the story through the Digg social network. Our computational framework is general and offers a practical solution to quantitative analysis of the microscopic structure of even very large cascades.',

Till date, there is no well known graph class of unbounded boxicity for which even an -factor approximation algorithm for computing boxicity is known, for any . In this paper, we study the boxicity problem on Circular Arc graphs - intersection graphs of arcs of a circle. We give a -factor polynomial time approximation algorithm for computing the boxicity of any circular arc graph along with a corresponding box representation, where is its boxicity. For Normal Circular Arc(NCA) graphs, with an NCA model given, this can be improved to an additive 2-factor approximation algorithm. The time complexity of the algorithms to approximately compute the boxicity is in both these cases and in time we also get their corresponding box representations, where is the number of vertices of the graph and is its number of edges. The additive 2-factor algorithm directly works for any Proper Circular Arc graph, since computing an NCA model for it can be done in polynomial time.',

	{'abstract': u'Learning structured representations has emerged as an important problem in many domains, including document and Web data mining, bioinformatics, and image analysis. One approach to learning complex structures is to integrate many smaller, incomplete and noisy structure fragments. In this work, we present an unsupervised probabilistic approach that extends affinity propagation to combine the small ontological fragments into a collection of integrated, consistent, and larger folksonomies. This is a challenging task because the method must aggregate similar structures while avoiding structural inconsistencies and handling noise. We validate the approach on a real-world social media dataset, comprised of shallow personal hierarchies specified by many individual users, collected from the photosharing website Flickr. Our empirical results show that our proposed approach is able to construct deeper and denser structures, compared to an approach using only the standard affinity propagation algorithm. Additionally, the approach yields better overall integration quality than a state-of-the-art approach based on incremental relational clustering.',

	{'abstract': u'We consider a multi-location inventory system where inventory choices at each location are centrally coordinated. Lateral transshipments are allowed as recourse actions within the same echelon in the inventory system to reduce costs and improve service level. However, this transshipment process usually causes undesirable lead times. In this paper, we propose a multiobjective model of the multi-location transshipment problem which addresses optimizing three conflicting objectives: (1) minimizing the aggregate expected cost, (2) maximizing the expected fill rate, and (3) minimizing the expected transshipment lead times. We apply an evolutionary multiobjective optimization approach using the strength Pareto evolutionary algorithm (SPEA2), to approximate the optimal Pareto front. Simulation with a wide choice of model parameters shows the different trades-off between the conflicting objectives.',

	{'abstract': u"This paper introduces a network coding-based protection scheme against single and multiple link failures. The proposed strategy ensures that in a connection, each node receives two copies of the same data unit: one copy on the working circuit, and a second copy that can be extracted from linear combinations of data units transmitted on a shared protection path. This guarantees instantaneous recovery of data units upon the failure of a working circuit. The strategy can be implemented at an overlay layer, which makes its deployment simple and scalable. While the proposed strategy is similar in spirit to the work of Kamal '07 &amp; '10, there are significant differences. In particular, it provides protection against multiple link failures. The new scheme is simpler, less expensive, and does not require the synchronization required by the original scheme. The sharing of the protection circuit by a number of connections is the key to the reduction of the cost of protection. The paper also conducts a comparison of the cost of the proposed scheme to the 1+1 and shared backup path protection (SBPP) strategies, and establishes the benefits of our strategy.",

	{'abstract': u'In recent years, reversible data hiding has attracted much more attention than before. Reversibility signifies that the original media can be recovered without any loss from the marked media after extracting the embedded message. This paper presents a new method that adopts two-level wavelet transform and exploits the feature of large wavelet coefficient variance to achieve the goal of high capacity with imperceptibility. Our method differs from those of previous ones in which the wavelet coefficients histogram not gray-level histogram is manipulated. Besides, clever shifting rules are introduced into histogram to avoid the decimal problem in pixel values after recovery to achieve reversibility. With small alteration of the wavelet coefficients in the embedding process, and therefore low visual distortion is obtained in the marked image. In addition, an important feature of our design is that the use of threshold is much different from previous studies. The results indicate that our design is superior to many other state-of-the-art reversible data hiding schemes.',

Matrix truncation (element dropping) is compared to SpAMM for quantum chemical matrices with approximate exponential and algebraic decay. For matched errors in the electronic total energy, SpAMM is found to require fewer to far fewer floating point operations relative to dropping.

	{'abstract': u'Empirical data shows that in the absence of incentives, a peer participating in a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) network wishes to free-riding. Most solutions for providing incentives in P2P networks are based on direct reciprocity, which are not appropriate for most P2P multimedia sharing networks due to the unique features exhibited by such networks: large populations of anonymous agents interacting infrequently, asymmetric interests of peers, network errors, and multiple concurrent transactions. In this paper, we design and rigorously analyze a new family of incentive protocols that utilizes indirect reciprocity which is based on the design of efficient social norms. In the proposed P2P protocols, the social norms consist of a social strategy, which represents the rule prescribing to the peers when they should or should not provide content to other peers, and a reputation scheme, which rewards or punishes peers depending on whether they comply or not with the social strategy. We first define the concept of a sustainable social norm, under which no peer has an incentive to deviate. We then formulate the problem of designing optimal social norms, which selects the social norm that maximizes the network performance among all sustainable social norms. Hence, we prove that it becomes in the self-interest of peers to contribute their content to the network rather than to free-ride. We also investigate the impact of various punishment schemes on the social welfare as well as how should the optimal social norms be designed if altruistic and malicious peers are active in the network. Our results show that optimal social norms are capable of providing significant improvements in the sharing efficiency of multimedia P2P networks.',

	{'abstract': u"To reduce computational complexity and delay in randomized network coded content distribution, and for some other practical reasons, coding is not performed simultaneously over all content blocks, but over much smaller, possibly overlapping subsets of these blocks, known as generations. A penalty of this strategy is throughput reduction. To analyze the throughput loss, we model coding over generations with random generation scheduling as a coupon collector's brotherhood problem. This model enables us to derive the expected number of coded packets needed for successful decoding of the entire content as well as the probability of decoding failure (the latter only when generations do not overlap) and further, to quantify the tradeoff between computational complexity and throughput. Interestingly, with a moderate increase in the generation size, throughput quickly approaches link capacity. Overlaps between generations can further improve throughput substantially for relatively small generation sizes.",

	{'abstract': u'An achievable rate region is obtained for a primary multiple access network coexisting with a secondary link of one transmitter and a corresponding receiver. The rate region depicts the sum primary rate versus the secondary rate and is established assuming that the secondary link performs rate-splitting. The achievable rate region is the union of two types of achievable rate regions. The first type is a rate region established assuming that the secondary receiver cannot decode any primary signal, whereas the second is established assuming that the secondary receiver can decode the signal of one primary receiver. The achievable rate region is determined first assuming discrete memoryless channel (DMC) then the results are applied to a Gaussian channel. In the Gaussian channel, the performance of rate-splitting is characterized for the two types of rate regions. Moreover, a necessary and sufficient condition to determine which primary signal that the secondary receiver can decode without degrading the range of primary achievable sum rates is provided. When this condition is satisfied by a certain primary user, the secondary receiver can decode its signal and achieve larger rates without reducing the primary achievable sum rates from the case in which it does not decode any primary signal. It is also shown that, the probability of having at least one primary user satisfying this condition grows with the primary signal to noise ratio.',

	{'abstract': u'Wireless sensor networks are often modeled in terms of a dense deployment of smart sensor nodes in a two-dimensional region. Give a node deployment, the emph over these locations (i.e., the connected emph with the smallest radius) is a useful structure since it provides the most accurate proportionality between hop-count and Euclidean distance. Hence, it can be used for GPS-free node localisation as well as minimum distance packet forwarding. It is also known to be asymptotically optimal for network transport capacity and power efficiency. In this context, we propose DISCRIT, a distributed and asynchronous algorithm for obtaining an approximation of the CGG on the node locations. The algorithm does not require the knowledge of node locations or internode distances, nor does it require pair-wise RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indication) measurements to be made. Instead, the algorithm makes use of successful Hello receipt counts (obtained during a Hello-protocol-based neighbour discovery process) as edge weights, along with a simple distributed min-max computation algorithm. In this paper, we first provide the theory for justifying the use of the above edge weights. Then we provide extensive simulation results to demonstrate the efficacy of DISCRIT in obtaining an approximation of the CGG. Finally, we show how the CGG obtained from DISCRIT performs when used in certain network self-organisation algorithms.',

	{'abstract': u'This paper considers the joint-decoding (JD) problem for finite-state channels (FSCs) and low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes. In the first part, the linear-programming (LP) decoder for binary linear codes is extended to JD of binary-input FSCs. In particular, we provide a rigorous definition of LP joint-decoding pseudo-codewords (JD-PCWs) that enables evaluation of the pairwise error probability between codewords and JD-PCWs in AWGN. This leads naturally to a provable upper bound on decoder failure probability. If the channel is a finite-state intersymbol interference channel, then the joint LP decoder also has the maximum-likelihood (ML) certificate property and all integer-valued solutions are codewords. In this case, the performance loss relative to ML decoding can be explained completely by fractional-valued JD-PCWs. After deriving these results, we discovered some elements were equivalent to earlier work by Flanagan on LP receivers. In the second part, we develop an efficient iterative solver for the joint LP decoder discussed in the first part. In particular, we extend the approach of iterative approximate LP decoding, proposed by Vontobel and Koetter and analyzed by Burshtein, to this problem. By taking advantage of the dual-domain structure of the JD-LP, we obtain a convergent iterative algorithm for joint LP decoding whose structure is similar to BCJR-based turbo equalization (TE). The result is a joint iterative decoder whose per-iteration complexity is similar to that of TE but whose performance is similar to that of joint LP decoding. The main advantage of this decoder is that it appears to provide the predictability of joint LP decoding and superior performance with the computational complexity of TE. One expected application is coding for magnetic storage where the required block-error rate is extremely low and system performance is difficult to verify by simulation.',

	{'abstract': u'This paper considers the problem of simultaneously communicating two messages, a high-security message and a low-security message, to a legitimate receiver, referred to as the security embedding problem. An information-theoretic formulation of the problem is presented. A coding scheme that combines rate splitting, superposition coding, nested binning and channel prefixing is considered and is shown to achieve the secrecy capacity region of the channel in several scenarios. Specifying these results to both scalar and independent parallel Gaussian channels (under an average individual per-subchannel power constraint), it is shown that the high-security message can be embedded into the low-security message at full rate (as if the low-security message does not exist) without incurring any loss on the overall rate of communication (as if both messages are low-security messages). Extensions to the wiretap channel II setting of Ozarow and Wyner are also considered, where it is shown that "perfect" security embedding can be achieved by an encoder that uses a two-level coset code.',

	{'abstract': u'A hitting set for a collection of sets is a set that has a non-empty intersection with each set in the collection; the hitting set problem is to find a hitting set of minimum cardinality. Motivated by instances of the hitting set problem where the number of sets to be hit is large, we introduce the notion of implicit hitting set problems. In an implicit hitting set problem the collection of sets to be hit is typically too large to list explicitly; instead, an oracle is provided which, given a set H, either determines that H is a hitting set or returns a set that H does not hit. We show a number of examples of classic implicit hitting set problems, and give a generic algorithm for solving such problems optimally. The main contribution of this paper is to show that this framework is valuable in developing approximation algorithms. We illustrate this methodology by presenting a simple on-line algorithm for the minimum feedback vertex set problem on random graphs. In particular our algorithm gives a feedback vertex set of size n-(1/p) log(1-o(1)) with probability at least 3/4 for the random graph G_ (the smallest feedback vertex set is of size n-(2/p) log(1+o(1))). We also consider a planted model for the feedback vertex set in directed random graphs. Here we show that a hitting set for a polynomial-sized subset of cycles is a hitting set for the planted random graph and this allows us to exactly recover the planted feedback vertex set.',

It allows, for example, fairly simple proofs for the classical problem how the (1+1) Evolutionary Algorithm (EA) optimizes an arbitrary pseudo-Boolean linear function.

	{'abstract': u"In this paper, we propose a distributed throughput-optimal ad hoc wireless network scheduling algorithm, which is motivated by the celebrated simplex algorithm for solving linear programming (LP) problems. The scheduler stores a sparse set of basic schedules, and chooses the max-weight basic schedule for transmission in each time slot. At the same time, the scheduler tries to update the set of basic schedules by searching for a new basic schedule in a throughput increasing direction. We show that both of the above procedures can be achieved in a distributed manner. Specifically, we propose an average consensus based link contending algorithm to implement the distributed max weight scheduling. Further, we show that the basic schedule update can be implemented using CSMA mechanisms, which is similar to the one proposed by Jiang et al. Compared to the optimal distributed scheduler in Jiang's paper, where schedules change in a random walk fashion, our algorithm has a better delay performance by achieving faster schedule transitions in the steady state. The performance of the algorithm is finally confirmed by simulation results.",

	{'abstract': u'In this paper, we explore worst-case solutions for the problems of single and multiple matching on strings in the word RAM model with word length w. In the first problem, we have to build a data structure based on a pattern p of length m over an alphabet of size sigma such that we can answer to the following query: given a text T of length n, where each character is encoded using log(sigma) bits return the positions of all the occurrences of p in T (in the following we refer by occ to the number of reported occurrences). For the multi-pattern matching problem we have a set S of d patterns of total length m and a query on a text T consists in finding all positions of all occurrences in T of the patterns in S. As each character of the text is encoded using log sigma bits and we can read w bits in constant time in the RAM model, we assume that we can read up to (w/log sigma) consecutive characters of the text in one time step. This implies that the fastest possible query time for both problems is O((n(log sigma/w)+occ). In this paper we present several different results for both problems which come close to that best possible query time. We first present two different linear space data structures for the first and second problem: the first one answers to single pattern matching queries in time O(n(1/m+log sigma/w)+occ) while the second one answers to multiple pattern matching queries to O(n((log d+log y+log log d)/y+log sigma/w)+occ) where y is the length of the shortest pattern in the case of multiple pattern-matching. We then show how a simple application of the four russian technique permits to get data structures with query times independent of the length of the shortest pattern (the length of the only pattern in case of single string matching) at the expense of using more space.',

	{'abstract': u'In most MIMO systems, the family of waterfall error curves, calculated at different spectral efficiencies, are asymptotically parallel at high SNR. In other words, most MIMO systems exhibit a single diversity value for all fixed rates. The MIMO MMSE receiver does not follow this pattern and exhibits a varying diversity in its family of error curves. This work analyzes this interesting behavior of the MMSE MIMO receiver and produces the MMSE MIMO diversity at all rates. The diversity of the quasi-static flat-fading MIMO channel consisting of any arbitrary number of transmit and receive antennas is fully characterized, showing that full spatial diversity is possible if and only if the rate is within a certain bound which is a function of the number of antennas. For other rates, the available diversity is fully characterized. At sufficiently low rates, the MMSE receiver has a diversity similar to the maximum likelihood receiver (maximal diversity), while at high rates it performs similarly to the zero-forcing receiver (minimal diversity). Linear receivers are also studied in the context of the MIMO multiple access channel (MAC). Then, the quasi-static frequency selective MIMO channel is analyzed under zero-padding (ZP) and cyclic-prefix (CP) block transmissions and MMSE reception, and lower and upper bounds on diversity are derived. For the special case of SIMO under CP, it is shown that the above-mentioned bounds are tight.',

	{'abstract': u'This paper links the conjecture that the physical world is a virtual reality to the findings of modern physics. What is usually the subject of science fiction is here proposed as a scientific theory open to empirical evaluation. We know from physics how the world behaves, and from computing how information behaves, so whether the physical world arises from ongoing information processing is a question science can evaluate. A prima facie case for the virtual reality conjecture is presented. If a photon is a pixel on a multi-dimensional grid that gives rise to space, the speed of light could reflect its refresh rate. If mass, charge and energy all arise from processing, the many conservation laws of physics could reduce to a single law of dynamic information conservation. If the universe is a virtual reality, then its big bang creation could be simply when the system was booted up. Deriving core physics from information processing could reconcile relativity and quantum theory, with the former how processing creates the space-time operating system and the latter how it creates energy and matter applications.',

	{'abstract': u'Automated software verification is a very active field of research which has made enormous progress both in theoretical and practical aspects. Recently, an important amount of research effort has been put into applying these techniques on top of mainstream programming languages. These languages typically provide powerful features such as reflection, aliasing and polymorphism which are handy for practitioners but, in contrast, make verification a real challenge. In this work we present Pest, a simple experimental, while-style, multiprocedural, imperative programming language which was conceived with verifiability as one of its main goals. This language forces developers to concurrently think about both the statements needed to implement an algorithm and the assertions required to prove its correctness. In order to aid programmers, we propose several techniques to reduce the number and complexity of annotations required to successfully verify their programs. In particular, we show that high-level iteration constructs may alleviate the need for providing complex loop annotations.',

	{'abstract': u'A traditionally desired goal when designing auction mechanisms is incentive compatibility, i.e., ensuring that bidders fare best by truthfully reporting their preferences. A complementary goal, which has, thus far, received significantly less attention, is to preserve privacy, i.e., to ensure that bidders reveal no more information than necessary. We further investigate and generalize the approximate privacy model for two-party communication recently introduced by Feigenbaum et al.[8]. We explore the privacy properties of a natural class of communication protocols that we refer to as "dissection protocols". Dissection protocols include, among others, the bisection auction in [9,10] and the bisection protocol for the millionaires problem in [8]. Informally, in a dissection protocol the communicating parties are restricted to answering simple questions of the form "Is your input between the values alpha and beta (under a predefined order over the possible inputs)?". We prove that for a large class of functions, called tiling functions, which include the 2nd-price Vickrey auction, there always exists a dissection protocol that provides a constant average-case privacy approximation ratio for uniform or "almost uniform" probability distributions over inputs. To establish this result we present an interesting connection between the approximate privacy framework and basic concepts in computational geometry. We show that such a good privacy approximation ratio for tiling functions does not, in general, exist in the worst case. We also discuss extensions of the basic setup to more than two parties and to non-tiling functions, and provide calculations of privacy approximation ratios for two functions of interest.',

We consider methods of solution together with practical applications. We present a brief overview of the RGT for easy understanding of the problem. We also develop the schematic representation of the RGT inference algorithms to create the basis for soft- and hardware solutions of the RGT tasks. We propose a unified hierarchy of schemas to represent humans and robots. This hierarchy is considered as a unified framework to solve the entire spectrum of the RGT tasks. We conclude by illustrating how this framework can be applied for modeling of mixed groups of humans and robots. All together this provides the exhaustive solution of the Inverse task and clearly illustrates its role and relationships with other issues considered in the RGT.',

	{'abstract': u"The problem of random number generation dates back to von Neumann's work in 1951. Since then, many algorithms have been developed for generating unbiased bits from complex correlated sources as well as for generating arbitrary distributions from unbiased bits. An equally interesting, but less studied aspect is the structural component of random number generation as opposed to the algorithmic aspect. That is, given a network structure imposed by nature or physical devices, how can we build networks that generate arbitrary probability distributions in an optimal way? In this paper, we study the generation of arbitrary probability distributions in multivalued relay circuits, a generalization in which relays can take on any of N states and the logical 'and' and 'or' are replaced with 'min' and 'max' respectively. Previous work was done on two-state relays. We generalize these results, describing a duality property and networks that generate arbitrary rational probability distributions. We prove that these networks are robust to errors and design a universal probability generator which takes input bits and outputs arbitrary binary probability distributions.",

	{'abstract': u'Invention of Transistors in 1948 started a new era in technology, called Solid State Electronics. Since then, sustaining development and advancement in electronics and fabrication techniques has caused the devices to shrink in size and become smaller, paving the quest for increasing density and clock speed. That quest has suddenly come to a halt due to fundamental bounds applied by physical laws. But, demand for more and more computational power is still prevalent in the computing world. As a result, the microprocessor industry has started exploring the technology along a different dimension. Speed of a single work unit (CPU) is no longer the concern, rather increasing the number of independent processor cores packed in a single package has become the new concern. Such processors are commonly known as multi-core processors. Scaling the performance by using multiple cores has gained so much attention from the academia and the industry, that not only desktops, but also laptops, PDAs, cell phones and even embedded devices today contain these processors. In this paper, we explore state of the art technologies for multi-core processors and existing software tools to support parallelism. We also discuss present and future trend of research in this field. From our survey, we conclude that next few decades are going to be marked by the success of this "Ubiquitous parallel processing".',

	{'abstract': u'Security becomes an extremely important issue in smart grid. To maintain the steady operation for smart power grid, massive measurement devices must be allocated widely among the power grid. Previous studies are focused on false data injection attack to the smart grid system. In practice, false data injection attack is not easy to implement, since it is not easy to hack the power grid data communication system. In this paper, we demonstrate that a novel time stamp attack is a practical and dangerous attack scheme for smart grid. Since most of measurement devices are equipped with global positioning system (GPS) to provide the time information of measurements, it is highly probable to attack the measurement system by spoofing the GPS. By employing the real measurement data in North American Power Grid, simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the time stamp attack on smart grid.',

	{'abstract': u'The goal of this paper is to obtain a better knowledge of the achievable data rate over noncoherent Rician fading channel with time and frequency memory. We assume that the average-power as well as the peak-power of the input signal are finite and the peak-power limitation is applied in the time domain. Expression for this rate is based on a lower bound on mutual information that assume independent and identically distributed input data symbols. The lower bound is expressed as a difference of two terms. The first term is the information rate of the coherent channel with a weighted signal-to-noise ratio that results from the peak-power limitation. The second term is a penalty term, explicit in the Doppler spectrum of the channel, that captures the effect of the channel uncertainty induced by the noncoherent setting. Impact of channel parameters, such as delay and Doppler spread, on the information rate are discussed and numerical applications on an experimental Rician channel surveyed in an acoustic underwater environment are also provided.',

Within SPL systems, I propose a special collection of designs called active material-energy looped systems using which it is possible to generate large-scale ordered chemical networks, like the metabolic networks, in a reliable, repeatable, iterative and natural manner.

	{'abstract': u'We extend the theory of labeled Markov processes with internal nondeterminism, a fundamental concept for the further development of a process theory with abstraction on nondeterministic continuous probabilistic systems. We define nondeterministic labeled Markov processes (NLMP) and provide three definition of bisimulations: a bisimulation following a traditional characterization, a state based bisimulation tailored to our "measurable" non-determinism, and an event based bisimulation. We show the relation between them, including that the largest state bisimulation is also an event bisimulation. We also introduce a variation of the Hennessy-Milner logic that characterizes event bisimulation and that is sound w.r.t. the other bisimulations for arbitrary NLMP. This logic, however, is infinitary as it contains a denumerable . We then introduce a finitary sublogic that characterize all bisimulations for image finite NLMP whose underlying measure space is also analytic. Hence, in this setting, all notions of bisimulation we deal with turn out to be equal. Finally, we show that all notions of bisimulations are different in the general case. The counterexamples that separate them turn to be non-probabilistic NLMP.',

	{'abstract': u'Social media generates a prodigious wealth of real-time content at an incessant rate. From all the content that people create and share, only a few topics manage to attract enough attention to rise to the top and become temporal trends which are displayed to users. The question of what factors cause the formation and persistence of trends is an important one that has not been answered yet. In this paper, we conduct an intensive study of trending topics on Twitter and provide a theoretical basis for the formation, persistence and decay of trends. We also demonstrate empirically how factors such as user activity and number of followers do not contribute strongly to trend creation and its propagation. In fact, we find that the resonance of the content with the users of the social network plays a major role in causing trends.',

	{'abstract': u"Spam messes up user's inbox, consumes network resources and spread worms and viruses. Spam is flooding of unsolicited, unwanted e mail. Spam in blogs is called blog spam or comment spam.It is done by posting comments or flooding spams to the services such as blogs, forums,news,email archives and guestbooks. Blog spams generally appears on guestbooks or comment pages where spammers fill a comment box with spam words. In addition to wasting user's time with unwanted comments, spam also consumes a lot of bandwidth. In this paper, we propose a software tool to prevent such blog spams by using Bayesian Algorithm based technique. It is derived from Bayes' Theorem. It gives an output which has a probability that any comment is spam, given that it has certain words in it. With using our past entries and a comment entry, this value is obtained and compared with a threshold value to find if it exceeds the threshold value or not. By using this concept, we developed a software tool to block comment spam. The experimental results show that the Bayesian based tool is working well. This paper has the major findings and their significance of blog spam filter.",

	{'abstract': u"We consider a set of agents who are attempting to iteratively learn the 'state of the world' from their neighbors in a social network. Each agent initially receives a noisy observation of the true state of the world. The agents then repeatedly 'vote' and observe the votes of some of their peers, from which they gain more information. The agents' calculations are Bayesian and aim to myopically maximize the expected utility at each iteration. This model, introduced by Gale and Kariv (2003), is a natural approach to learning on networks. However, it has been criticized, chiefly because the agents' decision rule appears to become computationally intractable as the number of iterations advances. For instance, a dynamic programming approach (part of this work) has running time that is exponentially large in min(n, (d-1)^t), where n is the number of agents. We provide a new algorithm to perform the agents' computations on locally tree-like graphs. Our algorithm uses the dynamic cavity method to drastically reduce computational effort. Let d be the maximum degree and t be the iteration number. The computational effort needed per agent is exponential only in O(td) (note that the number of possible information sets of a neighbor at time t is itself exponential in td). Under appropriate assumptions on the rate of convergence, we deduce that each agent is only required to spend polylogarithmic (in 1/ eps) computational effort to approximately learn the true state of the world with error probability eps, on regular trees of degree at least five. We provide numerical and other evidence to justify our assumption on convergence rate. We extend our results in various directions, including loopy graphs. Our results indicate efficiency of iterative Bayesian social learning in a wide range of situations, contrary to widely held beliefs.",

	{'abstract': u'High-rate space-time block codes (STBC with code rate &gt; 1) in multi-input multi-output (MIMO) systems are able to provide both spatial multiplexing gain and diversity gain, but have high maximum likelihood (ML) decoding complexity. Since group-decodable (quasi-orthogonal) code structure can reduce the decoding complexity, we present in this paper systematic methods to construct group-decodable high-rate STBC with full symbol-wise diversity gain for arbitrary transmit antenna number and code length. We show that the proposed group-decodable STBC can achieve high code rate that increases almost linearly with the transmit antenna number, and the slope of this near-linear dependence increases with the code length. Comparisons with existing low-rate and high-rate codes (such as orthogonal STBC and algebraic STBC) are conducted to show the decoding complexity reduction and good code performance achieved by the proposed codes.',

	{'abstract': u'The Generalized Second Price auction is the primary method by which sponsered search advertisements are sold. We study the performance of this auction under various equilibrium concepts. In particular, we demonstrate that the Bayesian Price of Anarchy is at most , significantly improving upon previously known bounds. Our techniques are intuitively straightforward and extend in a number of ways. For one, our result extends to a bound on the performance of GSP at coarse correlated equilibria, which captures (for example) a repeated-auction setting in which agents apply regret-minimizing bidding strategies. In addition, our analysis is robust against the presence of byzantine agents who cannot be assumed to participate rationally. Additionally, we present tight bounds for the social welfare obtained at pure NE for the special case of an auction for 3 slots, and discuss potential methods for extending this analysis to an arbitrary number of slots.',

	{'abstract': u'An extension to the classical notion of core is the notion of -additive core, that is, the set of -additive games which dominate a given game, where a -additive game has its M "obius transform (or Harsanyi dividends) vanishing for subsets of more than elements. Therefore, the 1-additive core coincides with the classical core. The advantages of the -additive core is that it is never empty once , and that it preserves the idea of coalitional rationality. However, it produces -imputations, that is, imputations on individuals and coalitions of at most inidividuals, instead of a classical imputation. Therefore one needs to derive a classical imputation from a -order imputation by a so-called sharing rule. The paper investigates what set of imputations the -additive core can produce from a given sharing rule.',

Furthermore, limiting the scope of this research to one challenge, we focus on the implementation of a semantic based search mechanism in PDM Systems. Going into the details, at first we describe the respective field i.e. Language Technology (LT), contributing towards natural language processing, to take advantage in implementing a search engine capable of understanding the semantic out of natural language based search queries. Then we discuss how can we practically take advantage of LT by implementing its concepts in the form of software application with the use of semantic web technology i.e. Ontology. Later, in the end of this research paper, we briefly present a prototype application developed with the use of concepts of LT towards semantic based search.",

	{'abstract': u'The core of a cooperative game on a set of players is one of the most popular concept of solution. When cooperation is restricted (feasible coalitions form a subcollection of ), the core may become unbounded, which makes it usage questionable in practice. Our proposal is to make the core bounded by turning some of the inequalities defining the core into equalities (additional efficiency constraints). We address the following mathematical problem: can we find a minimal set of inequalities in the core such that, if turned into equalities, the core becomes bounded? The new core obtained is called the restricted core. We completely solve the question when is a distributive lattice, introducing also the notion of restricted Weber set. We show that the case of regular set systems amounts more or less to the case of distributive lattices. We also study the case of weakly union-closed systems and give some results for the general case.',

The study is motivated from the need of updating the current operator-valued reproducing kernel in multi-task learning when underfitting or overfitting occurs. Numerical simulations confirm that the established refinement kernel method is able to meet this need. Various characterizations are provided based on feature maps and vector-valued integral representations of operator-valued reproducing kernels. Concrete examples of refining translation invariant and finite Hilbert-Schmidt operator-valued reproducing kernels are provided. Other examples include refinement of Hessian of scalar-valued translation-invariant kernels and transformation kernels. Existence and properties of operator-valued reproducing kernels preserved during the refinement process are also investigated.',

	{'abstract': u'The introduction of first-class type classes in the Coq system calls for re-examination of the basic interfaces used for mathematical formalization in type theory. We present a new set of type classes for mathematics and take full advantage of their unique features to make practical a particularly flexible approach formerly thought infeasible. Thus, we address both traditional proof engineering challenges as well as new ones resulting from our ambition to build upon this development a library of constructive analysis in which abstraction penalties inhibiting efficient computation are reduced to a minimum. The base of our development consists of type classes representing a standard algebraic hierarchy, as well as portions of category theory and universal algebra. On this foundation we build a set of mathematically sound abstract interfaces for different kinds of numbers, succinctly expressed using categorical language and universal algebra constructions. Strategic use of type classes lets us support these high-level theory-friendly definitions while still enabling efficient implementations unhindered by gratuitous indirection, conversion or projection. Algebra thrives on the interplay between syntax and semantics. The Prolog-like abilities of type class instance resolution allow us to conveniently define a quote function, thus facilitating the use of reflective techniques.',

	{'abstract': u'Let C be a depth-3 circuit with n variables, degree d and top fanin k (called sps(k,d,n) circuits) over base field F. It is a major open problem to design a deterministic polynomial time blackbox algorithm that tests if C is identically zero. Klivans &amp; Spielman (STOC 2001) observed that the problem is open even when k is a constant. This case has been subjected to a serious study over the past few years, starting from the work of Dvir &amp; Shpilka (STOC 2005). We give the first polynomial time blackbox algorithm for this problem. Our algorithm runs in time poly(nd^k), regardless of the base field. The only field for which polynomial time algorithms were previously known is F=Q (Kayal &amp; Saraf, FOCS 2009, and Saxena &amp; Seshadhri, FOCS 2010). This is the first blackbox algorithm for depth-3 circuits that does not use the rank based approaches of Karnin &amp; Shpilka (CCC 2008). We prove an important tool for the study of depth-3 identities. We design a blackbox polynomial time transformation that reduces the number of variables in a sps(k,d,n) circuit to k variables, but preserves the identity structure.',

	{'abstract': u'This paper proposes the problem of modeling video sequences of dynamic swarms (DS). We define DS as a large layout of stochastically repetitive spatial configurations of dynamic objects (swarm elements) whose motions exhibit local spatiotemporal interdependency and stationarity, i.e., the motions are similar in any small spatiotemporal neighborhood. Examples of DS abound in nature, e.g., herds of animals and flocks of birds. To capture the local spatiotemporal properties of the DS, we present a probabilistic model that learns both the spatial layout of swarm elements and their joint dynamics that are modeled as linear transformations. To this end, a spatiotemporal neighborhood is associated with each swarm element, in which local stationarity is enforced both spatially and temporally. We assume that the prior on the swarm dynamics is distributed according to an MRF in both space and time. Embedding this model in a MAP framework, we iterate between learning the spatial layout of the swarm and its dynamics. We learn the swarm transformations using ICM, which iterates between estimating these transformations and updating their distribution in the spatiotemporal neighborhoods. We demonstrate the validity of our method by conducting experiments on real video sequences. Real sequences of birds, geese, robot swarms, and pedestrians evaluate the applicability of our model to real world data.',

	{'abstract': u'In the setting of quasi-static multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channels, we consider the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) asymptotic complexity required by the sphere decoding (SD) algorithm for decoding a large class of full rate linear space-time codes. With SD complexity having random fluctuations induced by the random channel, noise and codeword realizations, the introduced SD complexity exponent manages to concisely describe the computational reserves required by the SD algorithm to achieve arbitrarily close to optimal decoding performance. Bounds and exact expressions for the SD complexity exponent are obtained for the decoding of large families of codes with arbitrary performance characteristics. For the particular example of decoding the recently introduced threaded cyclic division algebra (CDA) based codes -- the only currently known explicit designs that are uniformly optimal with respect to the diversity multiplexing tradeoff (DMT) -- the SD complexity exponent is shown to take a particularly concise form as a non-monotonic function of the multiplexing gain. To date, the SD complexity exponent also describes the minimum known complexity of any decoder that can provably achieve a gap to maximum likelihood (ML) performance which vanishes in the high SNR limit.',

	{'abstract': u'We present and analyze a simple and general scheme to build a churn (fault)-tolerant structured Peer-to-Peer (P2P) network. Our scheme shows how to ``convert" a static network into a dynamic distributed hash table(DHT)-based P2P network such that all the good properties of the static network are guaranteed with high probability (w.h.p). Applying our scheme to a cube-connected cycles network, for example, yields a degree connected network, in which every search succeeds in hops w.h.p., using messages, where is the expected stable network size. Our scheme has an constant storage overhead (the number of nodes responsible for servicing a data item) and an overhead (messages and time) per insertion and essentially no overhead for deletions. All these bounds are essentially optimal. While DHT schemes with similar guarantees are already known in the literature, this work is new in the following aspects: (1) It presents a rigorous mathematical analysis of the scheme under a general stochastic model of churn and shows the above guarantees; (2) The theoretical analysis is complemented by a simulation-based analysis that validates the asymptotic bounds even in moderately sized networks and also studies performance under changing stable network size; (3) The presented scheme seems especially suitable for maintaining dynamic structures under churn efficiently. In particular, we show that a spanning tree of low diameter can be efficiently maintained in constant time and logarithmic number of messages per insertion or deletion w.h.p.

In this paper we adapt a paradigm initially proposed for the classification of ordinal data to address the classification problem with reject option. The technique reduces the problem of classifying with reject option to the standard two-class problem. The introduced method is then mapped into support vector machines and neural networks. Finally, the framework is extended to multiclass ordinal data with reject option. An experimental study with synthetic and real data sets, verifies the usefulness of the proposed approach.',

	{'abstract': u"Contour tracking in adverse environments is a challenging problem due to cluttered background, illumination variation, occlusion, and noise, among others. This paper presents a robust contour tracking method by contributing to some of the key issues involved, including (a) a region functional formulation and its optimization; (b) design of a robust and effective feature; and (c) development of an integrated tracking algorithm. First, we formulate a region functional based on robust Earth Mover's distance (EMD) with kernel density for distribution modeling, and propose a two-phase method for its optimization. In the first phase, letting the candidate contour be fixed, we express EMD as the transportation problem and solve it by the simplex algorithm. Next, using the theory of shape derivative, we make a perturbation analysis of the contour around the best solution to the transportation problem. This leads to a partial differential equation (PDE) that governs the contour evolution. Second, we design a novel and effective feature for tracking applications. We propose a dimensionality reduction method by tensor decomposition, achieving a low-dimensional description of SIFT features called Tensor-SIFT for characterizing local image region properties. Applicable to both color and gray-level images, Tensor-SIFT is very distinctive, insensitive to illumination changes, and noise. Finally, we develop an integrated algorithm that combines various techniques of the simplex algorithm, narrow-band level set and fast marching algorithms. Particularly, we introduce an inter-frame initialization method and a stopping criterion for the termination of PDE iteration. Experiments in challenging image sequences show that the proposed work has promising performance.",

	{'abstract': u'This paper presents an in-depth analysis on the energy efficiency of Luby Transform (LT) codes with Frequency Shift Keying (FSK) modulation in a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) over Rayleigh fading channels with pathloss. We describe a proactive system model according to a flexible duty-cycling mechanism utilized in practical sensor apparatus. The present analysis is based on realistic parameters including the effect of channel bandwidth used in the IEEE 802.15.4 standard, active mode duration and computation energy. A comprehensive analysis, supported by some simulation studies on the probability mass function of the LT code rate and coding gain, shows that among uncoded FSK and various classical channel coding schemes, the optimized LT coded FSK is the most energy-efficient scheme for distance d greater than the pre-determined threshold level d_T , where the optimization is performed over coding and modulation parameters. In addition, although the optimized uncoded FSK outperforms coded schemes for d &lt; d_T , the energy gap between LT coded and uncoded FSK is negligible for d &lt; d_T compared to the other coded schemes. These results come from the flexibility of the LT code to adjust its rate to suit instantaneous channel conditions, and suggest that LT codes are beneficial in practical low-power WSNs with dynamic position sensor nodes.',

	{'abstract': u'The spectral efficiency of a representative uplink of a given length, in interference-limited, spatially-distributed wireless networks with hexagonal cells, simple power control, and multiantenna linear Minimum-Mean-Square-Error receivers is found to approach an asymptote as the numbers of base-station antennas N and wireless nodes go to infinity. An approximation for the area-averaged spectral efficiency of a representative link (averaged over the spatial base-station and mobile distributions), for Poisson distributed base stations, is also provided. For large N, in the interference-limited regime, the area-averaged spectral efficiency is primarily a function of the ratio of the product of N and the ratio of base-station to wireless-node densities, indicating that it is possible to scale such networks by linearly increasing the product of the number of base-station antennas and the relative density of base stations to wireless nodes, with wireless-node density. The results are useful for designers of wireless systems with high inter-cell interference because it provides simple expressions for spectral efficiency as a function of tangible system parameters like base-station and wireless-node densities, and number of antennas. These results were derived combining infinite random matrix theory and stochastic geometry.',

The derived CRB is valid for any full-rank linear redundant precoder, including both zero-padded (ZP) and cyclic-prefixed (CP) precoders. A simple form of CRBs for multiple complex parameters is also derived and presented which facilitates the CRB derivation of the problem of interest. A comparison is made between the derived CRBs and performances of existing subspace-based blind channel estimators for both CP and ZP systems. Numerical results show that there is still some room for performance improvement of blind channel estimators.',

	{'abstract': u'Grasping the fruits of "emerging technologies" is an objective of many government priority programs in a knowledge-based and globalizing economy. We use the publication records (in the Science Citation Index) of two emerging technologies to study the mechanisms of diffusion in the case of two innovation trajectories: small interference RNA (siRNA) and nano-crystalline solar cells (NCSC). Methods for analyzing and visualizing geographical and cognitive diffusion are specified as indicators of different dynamics. Geographical diffusion is illustrated with overlays to Google Maps; cognitive diffusion is mapped using an overlay to a map based on the ISI Subject Categories. The evolving geographical networks show both preferential attachment and small-world characteristics. The strength of preferential attachment decreases over time, while the network evolves into an oligopolistic control structure with small-world characteristics. The transition from disciplinary-oriented ("mode-1") to transfer-oriented ("mode-2") research is suggested as the crucial difference in explaining the different rates of diffusion between siRNA and NCSC.',

	{'abstract': u'A high degree of reliability for critical data transmission is required in body sensor networks (BSNs). However, BSNs are usually vulnerable to channel impairments due to body fading effect and RF interference, which may potentially cause data transmission to be unreliable. In this paper, an adaptive and flexible fault-tolerant communication scheme for BSNs, namely AFTCS, is proposed. AFTCS adopts a channel bandwidth reservation strategy to provide reliable data transmission when channel impairments occur. In order to fulfill the reliability requirements of critical sensors, fault-tolerant priority and queue are employed to adaptively adjust the channel bandwidth allocation. Simulation results show that AFTCS can alleviate the effect of channel impairments, while yielding lower packet loss rate and latency for critical sensors at runtime.',

	{'abstract': u'Wireless mesh networks (WMNs) have emerged as a promising concept to meet the challenges in next-generation networks such as providing flexible, adaptive, and reconfigurable architecture while offering cost-effective solutions to the service providers. Unlike traditional Wi-Fi networks, with each access point (AP) connected to the wired network, in WMNs only a subset of the APs are required to be connected to the wired network. The APs that are connected to the wired network are called the Internet gateways (IGWs), while the APs that do not have wired connections are called the mesh routers (MRs). The MRs are connected to the IGWs using multi-hop communication. The IGWs provide access to conventional clients and interconnect ad hoc, sensor, cellular, and other networks to the Internet. However, most of the existing routing protocols for WMNs are extensions of protocols originally designed for mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) and thus they perform sub-optimally. Moreover, most routing protocols for WMNs are designed without security issues in mind, where the nodes are all assumed to be honest. In practical deployment scenarios, this assumption does not hold. This chapter provides a comprehensive overview of security issues in WMNs and then particularly focuses on secure routing in these networks. First, it identifies security vulnerabilities in the medium access control (MAC) and the network layers. Various possibilities of compromising data confidentiality, data integrity, replay attacks and offline cryptanalysis are also discussed. Then various types of attacks in the MAC and the network layers are discussed. After enumerating the various types of attacks on the MAC and the network layer, the chapter briefly discusses on some of the preventive mechanisms for these attacks.',

	{'abstract': u'There is a growing interest in design and implementation of cyber-physical control systems over wireless sensor and actuator networks (WSANs). Thanks to the use of wireless communications and distributed architectures, these systems encompass many advantages as compared to traditional networked control systems using hard wirelines. While WSANs are enabling a new generation of control systems, they also introduce considerable challenges for quality-of-service (QoS) provisioning. In this chapter we examine some of the major QoS challenges raised by WSANs, including resource constraints, platform heterogeneity, dynamic network topology, and mixed traffic. These challenges make it difficult to fulfill the requirements of cyber-physical control in terms of reliability and real-time. The focus of this chapter is on addressing the problem of network reliability. Specifically, we analyze the behavior of wireless channels via simulations based on a realistic link-layer model. Packet loss rate (PLR) is taken as a major metric for the analysis. The results confirm the unreliability of wireless communications and the uncertainty of packet loss over WSANs. To tackle packet loss, we present a simple solution that can take advantage of existing prediction algorithms. Simulations are conducted to evaluate the performance of several classical prediction algorithms used for packet loss compensation. The results give some insights into how to deal with packet loss in cyber-physical control systems over unreliable WSANs.',

	{'abstract': u'Ensuring security of e-government applications and infrastructures is crucial to maintain trust among stakeholders to store, process and exchange information over the e-government systems. Due to dynamic and continuous threats on e-government information security, policy makers need to perform evaluation on existing information security strategy as to deliver trusted e-government services. This paper presents an information security evaluation framework based on new fuzzy multi criteria decision making (MCDM) to help policy makers conduct comprehensive assessment of e-government security strategy.',

	{'abstract': u'We examine some variants of computation with closed timelike curves (CTCs), where various restrictions are imposed on the memory of the computer, and the information carrying capacity and range of the CTC. We give full characterizations of the classes of languages recognized by polynomial time probabilistic and quantum computers that can send a single classical bit to their own past. Such narrow CTCs are demonstrated to add the power of limited nondeterminism to deterministic computers, and lead to exponential speedup in constant-space probabilistic and quantum computation. We show that, given a time machine with constant negative delay, one can implement CTC-based computations without the need to know about the runtime beforehand.',

Easy to carry, easy to use and easy to buy, smart phones with certain software are of great advantage. Consequently, mobile social networking (MSN) systems have emerged rapidly, being a revolution for our everyday life. Based on the analysis of general requirements of MSN and location-based services (LBS), this paper presents the design of iZone, a mobile social networking system, as well as a prototype implementation.

	{'abstract': u'In pervasive computing environments, Location- Based Services (LBSs) are becoming increasingly important due to continuous advances in mobile networks and positioning technologies. Nevertheless, the wide deployment of LBSs can jeopardize the location privacy of mobile users. Consequently, providing safeguards for location privacy of mobile users against being attacked is an important research issue. In this paper a new scheme for safeguarding location privacy is proposed. Our approach supports location K-anonymity for a wide range of mobile users with their own desired anonymity levels by clustering. The whole area of all users is divided into clusters recursively in order to get the Minimum Bounding Rectangle (MBR). The exact location information of a user is replaced by his MBR. Privacy analysis shows that our approach can achieve high resilience to location privacy threats and provide more privacy than users expect. Complexity analysis shows clusters can be adjusted in real time as mobile users join or leave. Moreover, the clustering algorithms possess strong robustness.',

With focus on its differences with conventional WAM implementations, we explain key details of BinProlog\'s compilation technique, which replaces the WAM with a simplified continuation passing runtime system (the "BinWAM"), based on a mapping of full Prolog to binary logic programs. This is followed by a description of a term compression technique using a "tag-on-data" representation. Later derivatives, the Java-based Jinni Prolog compiler and the recently developed Lean Prolog system refine the BinProlog architecture with first-class Logic Engines, made generic through the use of an Interactor interface. An overview of their applications with focus on the ability to express at source level a wide variety of Prolog built-ins and extensions, covers these newer developments.',

	{'abstract': u'Many localization algorithms and systems have been developed by means of wireless sensor networks for both indoor and outdoor environments. To achieve higher localization accuracy, extra hardware equipments are utilized by most of the existing localization algorithms, which increase the cost and greatly limit the range of location-based applications. In this paper we present a method which can effectively meet different localization accuracy requirements of most indoor and outdoor location services in realistic applications. Our algorithm is composed of two phases: partition phase, in which the target region is split into small grids and localization refinement phase in which a higher accuracy location can be generated by applying a trick algorithm. A realistic demo system using our algorithm has been developed to illustrate its feasibility and availability. The results show that our algorithm can improve the localization accuracy.',

This paper proposes a trust model to protect the user's security. The billing or trust operator works as an agent to provide a trust authentication for all the service providers. The services are classified by sensitive value calculation. With the value, the user's trustiness for corresponding service can be obtained. For decision, three trust regions are divided, which is referred to three ranks: high, medium and low. The trust region tells the customer, with his calculated trust value, which rank he has got and which authentication methods should be used for access. Authentication history and penalty are also involved with reasons.",

The crossed presence of scholars on editorial boards, the phenomenon called interlocking editorship, is considered a proxy of the similarity of editorial policies. The evidences support the idea that this group of journals is better described as a set of only relatively connected subfields. In particular two main subfield are identified, consisting of research oriented journals devoted respectively to LIS and MIS. The links between these two subsets are weak. Around these two subsets there are a lot of (relatively) isolated professional journals or journals characterized more by their subject-matter content than by their focus on information flows. It is possible to suggest that this configuration of the network may be the consequence of the youthfulness of Information Science &amp; Library Science, which has not permitted yet to reach a general consensus through scholars on research aims, methods and instruments.',

To consider cooperating encoders, it is assumed that each encoder strictly-causally receives and learns the other encoder's transmitted symbols and tries to cooperate with the other encoder by transmitting its message. Next, we study this channel in a special case; we assume that the common part of both states is known at both, hence encoders use this opportunity to get better rate region. For these scenarios, an achievable rate region is derived based on a combination of block-Markov encoding and Gel'fand-Pinsker coding techniques. Furthermore, the achievable rate region is established for the Gaussian channel, and it is shown that the capacity region is achieved in certain circumstances.",

	{'abstract': u'Body Sensor Networks (BSNs) provide continuous health monitoring and analysis of physiological parameters. A high degree of Quality-of-Service (QoS) for BSN is extremely required. Inter-user interference is introduced by the simultaneous communication of BSNs congregating in the same area. In this paper, a decentralized inter-user interference suppression algorithm for BSN, namely DISG, is proposed. Each BSN measures the SINR from other BSNs and then adaptively selects the suitable channel and transmission power. By utilizing non-cooperative game theory and no regret learning algorithm, DISG provides an adaptive inter-user interference suppression strategy. The correctness and effectiveness of DISG is theoretically proved, and the experimental results show that DISG can reduce the effect of inter-user interference effectively.',

	{'abstract': u'We extend the study of the complexity of finding an -approximate Nash equilibrium in congestion games from the case of positive delay functions to delays of arbitrary sign. We first prove that in symmetric games with -bounded jump the -Nash dynamic converges in polynomial time when all delay functions are negative, similarly to the case of positive delays. We then establish a hardness result for symmetric games with -bounded jump and with arbitrary delay functions: in that case finding an -Nash equilibrium becomes -complete.',

	{'abstract': u'Even though channel assignment has been studied for years, the performance of most IEEE 802.11-based multi-hop wireless networks such as wireless sensor network (WSN), wireless mesh network (WMN), mobile ad hoc network (MANET) is limited by channel interference. Properly assigning orthogonal channels to wireless links can improve the throughput of multi-hop networks. To solve the dynamic channel assignment problem, a routing-based channel assignment algorithm called R-CA is proposed. R-CA can allocate channels for wireless nodes when needed and free channels after data transmission. Thus more channel resource can be explored by wireless nodes. Simulation results show that R-CA can effectively enhance the network throughput and packet delivery rate.',

	{'abstract': u"With the growing number of the elderly, we see a greater demand for home care, and the vision of pervasive computing is also floating into the domain of the household that aims to build a smart home which can assist inhabitants (users) to live more conveniently and harmoniously. Such health-care pervasive applications in smart home should focus on the inhabitant's goal or task in diverse situations, rather than the various complex devices and services. The core challenge for homecare design is to perceive the environment and assess occurring situations, thus allowing systems to behave intelligently according to the user's intent. Due to the dynamic and heterogeneous nature of pervasive computing environment, it is difficult for an average user to obtain right information and service and in right place at right time. This paper proposes a context-driven task-oriented middleware (CDTOM) to meet the challenge. The most important component is its task model that provides an adequate high-level description of user-oriented tasks and their related contexts. Leveraging the model multiple entities can easily exchange, share and reuse their knowledge. Based on the hierarchy of task ontology, a novel task recognition approach using CBR (case-based reasoning) is presented and the performance of task recognition is evaluated by task number, context size and time costing. Moreover, a dynamic mechanism for mapping the recognized task and services is also discussed. Finally, we present the design and implementation of our task supporting system (TSS) to aid an inhabitant's tasks in light of his lifestyle and environment conditions in pervasive homecare environment, and the results of the prototype system show that our middleware approach achieves good efficiency of context management and good accuracy of user's activity inference, and can improve efficiently quality of user's life.",

	{'abstract': u'It is an increasingly important issue to reduce the energy consumption of computing systems. In this paper, we consider partition based energy-aware scheduling of periodic real-time tasks on multicore processors. The scheduling exploits dynamic voltage scaling (DVS) and core sleep scheduling to reduce both dynamic and leakage energy consumption. If the overhead of core state switching is non-negligible, however, the performance of this scheduling strategy in terms of energy efficiency might degrade. To achieve further energy saving, we extend the static task scheduling with run-time task reallocation. The basic idea is to aggregate idle time among cores so that as many cores as possible could be put into sleep in a way that the overall energy consumption is reduced. Simulation results show that the proposed approach results in up to 20% energy saving over traditional leakage-aware DVS.',

	{'abstract': u'A distributed detection scheme where the sensors transmit with constant modulus signals over a Gaussian multiple access channel is considered. The deflection coefficient of the proposed scheme is shown to depend on the characteristic function of the sensing noise and the error exponent for the system is derived using large deviation theory. Optimization of the deflection coefficient and error exponent are considered with respect to a transmission phase parameter for a variety of sensing noise distributions including impulsive ones. The proposed scheme is also favorably compared with existing amplify-and-forward and detect-and-forward schemes. The effect of fading is shown to be detrimental to the detection performance through a reduction in the deflection coefficient depending on the fading statistics. Simulations corroborate that the deflection coefficient and error exponent can be effectively used to optimize the error probability for a wide variety of sensing noise distributions.',

	{'abstract': u'Randomized search heuristics such as evolutionary algorithms, simulated annealing, and ant colony optimization are a broadly used class of general-purpose algorithms. Analyzing them via classical methods of theoretical computer science is a growing field. While several strong runtime analysis results have appeared in the last 20 years, a powerful complexity theory for such algorithms is yet to be developed. We enrich the existing notions of black-box complexity by the additional restriction that not the actual objective values, but only the relative quality of the previously evaluated solutions may be taken into account by the black-box algorithm. Many randomized search heuristics belong to this class of algorithms. We show that the new ranking-based model gives more realistic complexity estimates for some problems. For example, the class of all binary-value functions has a black-box complexity of in the previous black-box models, but has a ranking-based complexity of . For the class of all OneMax functions, we present a ranking-based black-box algorithm that has a runtime of , which shows that the OneMax problem does not become harder with the additional ranking-basedness restriction.',

	{'abstract': u'We study the problem in distributed networks, stated as follows. Let be a subgraph of a network where each vertex of knows which edges incident on it are in . We would like to verify whether has some properties, e.g., if it is a tree or if it is connected. We would like to perform this verification in a decentralized fashion via a distributed algorithm. The time complexity of verification is measured as the number of rounds of distributed communication. In this paper we initiate a systematic study of distributed verification, and give almost tight lower bounds on the running time of distributed verification algorithms for many fundamental problems such as connectivity, spanning connected subgraph, and cut verification. We then show applications of these results in deriving strong unconditional time lower bounds on the for many classical optimization problems including minimum spanning tree, shortest paths, and minimum cut. Many of these results are the first non-trivial lower bounds for both exact and approximate distributed computation and they resolve previous open questions. Moreover, our unconditional lower bound of approximating minimum spanning tree (MST) subsumes and improves upon the previous hardness of approximation bound of Elkin [STOC 2004] as well as the lower bound for (exact) MST computation of Peleg and Rubinovich [FOCS 1999]. Our result implies that there can be no distributed approximation algorithm for MST that is significantly faster than the current exact algorithm, for approximation factor. Our lower bound proofs show an interesting connection between communication complexity and distributed computing which turns out to be useful in establishing the time complexity of exact and approximate distributed computation of many problems.',

	{'abstract': u'Combining the properties of monovariate internal functions as proposed in Kolmogorov superimposition theorem, in tandem with the bounds wielded by the multivariate formulation of Chebyshev inequality, a hybrid model is presented, that decomposes images into homogeneous probabilistically bounded multivariate surfaces. Given an image, the model shows a novel way of working on reduced image representation while processing and capturing the interaction among the multidimensional information that describes the content of the same. Further, it tackles the practical issues of preventing leakage by bounding the growth of surface and reducing the problem sample size. The model if used, also sheds light on how the Chebyshev parameter relates to the number of pixels and the dimensionality of the feature space that associates with a pixel. Initial segmentation results on the Berkeley image segmentation benchmark indicate the effectiveness of the proposed decomposition algorithm.',

	{'abstract': u'This paper undertakes a re-examination of Sir William Hamilton\'s doctrine of the quantification of the predicate. Hamilton\'s doctrine comprises two theses. First, the predicates of traditional syllogistic sentence-forms contain implicit existential quantifiers, so that, for example, "All p are q" is to be understood as "All p are some q". Second, these implicit quantifiers can be meaningfully dualized to yield novel sentence-forms, such as, for example, "All p are all q". Hamilton attempted to provide a deductive system for his language, along the lines of the classical syllogisms. We show, using techniques unavailable to Hamilton, that such a system does exist, though with qualifications that distinguish it from its classical counterpart.',

	{'abstract': u'We propose an algorithm that builds and maintains clusters over a network subject to mobility. This algorithm is fully decentralized and makes all the different clusters grow concurrently. The algorithm uses circulating tokens that collect data and move according to a random walk traversal scheme. Their task consists in (i) creating a cluster with the nodes it discovers and (ii) managing the cluster expansion; all decisions affecting the cluster are taken only by a node that owns the token. The size of each cluster is maintained higher than nodes ( is a parameter of the algorithm). The obtained clustering is locally optimal in the sense that, with only a local view of each clusters, it computes the largest possible number of clusters ( emph the sizes of the clusters are as close to as possible). This algorithm is designed as a decentralized control algorithm for large scale networks and is mobility-adaptive: after a series of topological changes, the algorithm converges to a clustering. This recomputation only affects nodes in clusters in which topological changes happened, and in adjacent clusters.',

	{'abstract': u'In this work, we study the problem of power allocation and adaptive modulation in teams of decision makers. We consider the special case of two teams with each team consisting of two mobile agents. Agents belonging to the same team communicate over wireless ad hoc networks, and they try to split their available power between the tasks of communication and jamming the nodes of the other team. The agents have constraints on their total energy and instantaneous power usage. The cost function adopted is the difference between the rates of erroneously transmitted bits of each team. We model the adaptive modulation problem as a zero-sum matrix game which in turn gives rise to a a continuous kernel game to handle power control. Based on the communications model, we present sufficient conditions on the physical parameters of the agents for the existence of a pure strategy saddle-point equilibrium (PSSPE).',

	{'abstract': u"A traditional paper-based passport contains a Machine- Readable Zone (MRZ) and a Visual Inspection Zone (VIZ). The MRZ has two lines of the holder's personal data, some document data, and verification characters encoded using the Optical Character Recognition font B (OCRB). The encoded data includes the holder's name, date of birth, and other identifying information for the holder or the document. The VIZ contains the holder's photo and signature, usually on the data page. However, the MRZ and VIZ can be easily duplicated with normal document reproduction technology to produce a fake passport which can pass traditional verification. Neither of these features actively verify the holder's identity; nor do they bind the holder's identity to the document. A passport also contains pages for stamps of visas and of country entry and exit dates, which can be easily altered to produce fake permissions and travel records. The electronic passport, supporting authentication using secure credentials on a tamper-resistant chip, is an attempt to improve on the security of the paper-based passport at minimum cost. This paper surveys the security mechanisms built into the firstgeneration of authentication mechanisms and compares them with second-generation passports. It analyzes and describes the cryptographic protocols used in Basic Access Control (BAC) and Extended Access Control (EAC).",

We present Treelicious, a system that allows hierarchical navigation of tagged web pages. Our system enriches the navigational capabilities of standard tagging systems, which typically exploit only popularity and co-occurrence data. We describe a prototype that leverages the Wikipedia category structure to allow a user to semantically navigate pages from the Delicious social bookmarking service. In our system a user can perform an ordinary keyword search and browse relevant pages but is also given the ability to broaden the search to more general topics and narrow it to more specific topics. We show that Treelicious indeed provides an intuitive framework that allows for improved and effective discovery of knowledge.',

	{'abstract': u"Robustness of distributed routing policies is studied for dynamical flow networks, with respect to adversarial disturbances that reduce the link flow capacities. A dynamical flow network is modeled as a system of ordinary differential equations derived from mass conservation laws on a directed acyclic graph with a single origin-destination pair and a constant inflow at the origin. Routing policies regulate the way the inflow at a non-destination node gets split among its outgoing links as a function of the current particle density, while the outflow of a link is modeled to depend on the current particle density on that link through a flow function. The dynamical flow network is called partially transferring if the total inflow at the destination node is asymptotically bounded away from zero, and its weak resilience is measured as the minimum sum of the link-wise magnitude of all disturbances that make it not partially transferring. The weak resilience of a dynamical flow network with arbitrary routing policy is shown to be upper-bounded by the network's min-cut capacity, independently of the initial flow conditions. Moreover, a class of distributed routing policies that rely exclusively on local information on the particle densities, and are locally responsive to that, is shown to yield such maximal weak resilience. These results imply that locality constraints on the information available to the routing policies do not cause loss of weak resilience. Some fundamental properties of dynamical flow networks driven by locally responsive distributed policies are analyzed in detail, including global convergence to a unique limit flow.",

These codes achieve the capacity of many important channels under successive cancellation decoding. Motivated by the rapid progress in the theory of polar codes, we propose a family of architectures for efficient hardware implementation of successive cancellation decoders. We show that such decoders can be implemented with O(n) processing elements and O(n) memory elements, while providing constant throughput. We also propose a technique for overlapping the decoding of several consecutive codewords, thereby achieving a significant speed-up factor. We furthermore show that successive cancellation decoding can be implemented in the logarithmic domain, thereby eliminating the multiplication and division operations and greatly reducing the complexity of each processing element.',

	{'abstract': u'Outage probability and capacity of a class of block-fading MIMO channels are considered with partial channel distribution information. Specifically, the channel or its distribution are not known but the latter is known to belong to a class of distributions where each member is within a certain distance (uncertainty) from a nominal distribution. Relative entropy is used as a measure of distance between distributions. Compound outage probability defined as min (over the transmit signal distribution) -max (over the channel distribution class) outage probability is introduced and investigated. This generalizes the standard outage probability to the case of partial channel distribution information. Compound outage probability characterization (via one-dimensional convex optimization), its properties and approximations are given. It is shown to have two-regime behavior: when the nominal outage probability decreases (e.g. by increasing the SNR), the compound outage first decreases linearly down to a certain threshold (related to relative entropy distance) and then only logarithmically (i.e. very slowly), so that no significant further decrease is possible. The compound outage depends on the relative entropy distance and the nominal outage only, all other details (nominal fading and noise distributions) being irrelevant. The transmit signal distribution optimized for the nominal channel distribution is shown to be also optimal for the whole class of distributions. The effect of swapping the distributions in relative entropy is investigated and an error floor effect is established. The compound outage probability under Lp distance constraint is also investigated. The obtained results hold for a generic channel model (arbitrary nominal fading and noise distributions).',

The formula psi is said to be the reified counterpart of sigma.

	{'abstract': u'While medical imaging typically provides massive amounts of data, the extraction of relevant information for predictive diagnosis remains a difficult challenge. Functional MRI (fMRI) data, that provide an indirect measure of task-related or spontaneous neuronal activity, are classically analyzed in a mass-univariate procedure yielding statistical parametric maps. This analysis framework disregards some important principles of brain organization: population coding, distributed and overlapping representations. Multivariate pattern analysis, i.e., the prediction of behavioural variables from brain activation patterns better captures this structure. To cope with the high dimensionality of the data, the learning method has to be regularized. However, the spatial structure of the image is not taken into account in standard regularization methods, so that the extracted features are often hard to interpret. More informative and interpretable results can be obtained with the l_1 norm of the image gradient, a.k.a. its Total Variation (TV), as regularization. We apply for the first time this method to fMRI data, and show that TV regularization is well suited to the purpose of brain mapping while being a powerful tool for brain decoding. Moreover, this article presents the first use of TV regularization for classification.',

	{'abstract': u'In this paper, we show that theory of processes can be reduced to the theory of spatial logic. Firstly, we propose a spatial logic SL for higher order pi-calculus, and give an inference system of SL. The soundness and incompleteness of SL are proved. Furthermore, we show that the structure congruence relation and one-step transition relation can be described as the logical relation of SL formulae. We also extend bisimulations for processes to that for SL formulae. Then we extend all definitions and results of SL to a weak semantics version of SL, called WL. At last, we add mu-operator to SL. This new logic is named muSL. We show that WL is a sublogic of muSL and replication operator can be expressed in muSL.',

	{'abstract': u'We consider a repeated Matching Pennies game in which players have limited access to randomness. Playing the (unique) Nash equilibrium in this n-stage game requires n random bits. Can there be Nash equilibria that use less than n random coins? Our main results are as follows: We give a full characterization of approximate equilibria, showing that, for any e in [0, 1], the game has a e-Nash equilibrium if and only if both players have (1 - e)n random coins. When players are bound to run in polynomial time, Nash equilibria can exist if and only if one-way functions exist. It is possible to trade-off randomness for running time. In particular, under reasonable assumptions, if we give one player only O(log n) random coins but allow him to run in arbitrary polynomial time and we restrict his opponent to run in time n^k, for some fixed k, then we can sustain an Nash equilibrium. When the game is played for an infinite amount of rounds with time discounted utilities, under reasonable assumptions, we can reduce the amount of randomness required to achieve a e-Nash equilibrium to n, where n is the number of random coins necessary to achieve an approximate Nash equilibrium in the general case.',

	{'abstract': u'Schaefer\'s theorem is a complexity classification result for so-called Boolean constraint satisfaction problems: it states that every Boolean constraint satisfaction problem is either contained in one out of six classes and can be solved in polynomial time, or is NP-complete. We present an analog of this dichotomy result for the propositional logic of graphs instead of Boolean logic. In this generalization of Schaefer\'s result, the input consists of a set W of variables and a conjunction Phi of statements ("constraints") about these variables in the language of graphs, where each statement is taken from a fixed finite set Psi of allowed quantifier-free first-order formulas; the question is whether Phi is satisfiable in a graph. We prove that either Psi is contained in one out of 17 classes of graph formulas and the corresponding problem can be solved in polynomial time, or the problem is NP-complete. This is achieved by a universal-algebraic approach, which in turn allows us to use structural Ramsey theory. To apply the universal-algebraic approach, we formulate the computational problems under consideration as constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs) whose templates are first-order definable in the countably infinite random graph. Our method to classify the computational complexity of those CSPs is based on a Ramsey-theoretic analysis of functions acting on the random graph, and we develop general tools suitable for such an analysis which are of independent mathematical interest.',

	{'abstract': u'In this paper, we present an evaluation of the Ethernet traffic for host and attendees of the popular opensource web conferencing system DimDim. While traditional Internet-centric approaches such as the MBONE have been used over the past decades, current trends for web-based conference systems make exclusive use of application-layer multicast. To allow for network dimensioning and QoS provisioning, an understanding of the underlying traffic characteristics is required. We find in our exemplary evaluations that the host of a web conference session produces a large amount of Ethernet traffic, largely due to the required control of the conference session, that is heavily-tailed distributed and exhibits additionally long-range dependence. For different groups of activities within a web conference session, we find distinctive characteristics of the generated traffic.',

	{'abstract': u'Interference matrix (IM) has been widely used in frequency planning/optimization of cellular systems because it describes the interaction between any two cells. IM is generated from the source data gathered from the cellular system, either mobile measurement reports (MMRs) or drive test (DT) records. IM accuracy is not satisfactory since neither MMRs nor DT records contain complete information on interference and traffic distribution. In this paper, two IM generation algorithms based on source data fusion are proposed. Data fusion in one algorithm is to reinforce MMRs data, using the frequency-domain information of DT data from the same region. Data fusion in another algorithm is to reshape DT data, using the traffic distribution information extracted from MMRs from the same region. The fused data contains more complete information so that more accurate IM can be obtained. Simulation results have validated this conclusion.',

	{'abstract': u'Many programmers, when they encounter an error, would like to have the benefit of automatic fix suggestions---as long as they are, most of the time, adequate. Initial research in this direction has generally limited itself to specific areas, such as data structure classes with carefully designed interfaces, and relied on simple approaches. To provide high-quality fix suggestions in a broad area of applicability, the present work relies on the presence of contracts in the code, and on the availability of dynamic analysis to gather evidence on the values taken by expressions derived from the program text. The ideas have been built into the AutoFix-E2 automatic fix generator. Applications of AutoFix-E2 to general-purpose software, such as a library to manipulate documents, show that the approach provides an improvement over previous techniques, in particular purely model-based approaches.',

	{'abstract': u'In this paper we study minimum cut and maximum flow problems on planar graphs, both in static and in dynamic settings. First, we present an algorithm that given an undirected planar graph computes the minimum cut between any two given vertices in O(n log log n) time. Second, we show how to achieve the same O(n log log n) bound for the problem of computing maximum flows in undirected planar graphs. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first algorithms for those two problems that break the O(n log n) barrier, which has been standing for more than 25 years. Third, we present a fully dynamic algorithm that is able to maintain information about minimum cuts and maximum flows in a plane graph (i.e., a planar graph with a fixed embedding): our algorithm is able to insert edges, delete edges and answer min-cut and max-flow queries between any pair of vertices in O(n^(2/3) log^3 n) time per operation. This result is based on a new dynamic shortest path algorithm for planar graphs which may be of independent interest. We remark that this is the first known non-trivial algorithm for min-cut and max-flow problems in a dynamic setting.',

	{'abstract': u'The use of RFID tag which identifies a thing and an object will be expanded with progress of ubiquitous society, and it is necessary to study how to construct RFID network system as a social infrastructure like the Internet. First, this paper proposes the virtualization method of RFID tag network system to enable the same physical RFID network system to be used by multiple different service systems. The system virtualization not only reduces the system cost but also can dramatically reduce the installation space of physical readers and the operation cost. It is proposed that all equipments in the RFID network system except RFID tag could be shared with the conventional virtual technologies. Then, this paper proposes the conditional tag ID processing and the efficient tag ID transmission method which can greatly reduce the processing time and processing load in RFID tag Infrastructure network The conditional tag ID processing allows that tag ID is valid only at a certain time zone of day or in a certain area. The efficient tag ID transmission method uses the virtual network address of the service center as a part of the ID of an RF tag, which allows the direct ID forwarding to the service center.',

	{'abstract': u"We study the evolution of cooperation in populations where individuals play prisoner's dilemma on a network. Every node of the network corresponds on an individual choosing whether to cooperate or defect in a repeated game. The players revise their actions by imitating those neighbors who have higher payoffs. We show that when the interactions take place on graphs with large girth, cooperation is more likely to emerge. On the flip side, in graphs with many cycles of length 3 and 4, defection spreads more rapidly. One of the key ideas of our analysis is that our dynamics can be seen as a perturbation of the voter model. We write the transition kernel of the corresponding Markov chain in terms of the pairwise correlations in the voter model. We analyze the pairwise correlation and show that in graphs with relatively large girth, cooperators cluster and help each other.",

	{'abstract': u"We study a wireless broadcast network, where a single source reliably communicates independent messages to multiple destinations, with the aid of relays and cooperation between destinations. The wireless nature of the medium is captured by the broadcast nature of transmissions as well as the superposition of all transmit signals plus independent Gaussian noise at the received signal at any radio. We propose a scheme that can achieve rate tuples within a constant gap away from the cut-set bound, where the constant is independent of channel coefficients and power constraints. The proposed scheme operates in two steps. The inner code, in which the relays perform a quantize-and-encode operation, is constructed by lifting a scheme designed for a corresponding discrete superposition network. The outer code is a Marton code for the non-Gaussian vector broadcast channel induced by the relaying scheme, and is constructed by adopting a ``receiver-centric'' viewpoint.",

	{'abstract': u"We present and study an agent-based model of T-Cell cross-regulation in the adaptive immune system, which we apply to binary classification. Our method expands an existing analytical model of T-cell cross-regulation (Carneiro et al. in Immunol Rev 216(1):48-68, 2007) that was used to study the self-organizing dynamics of a single population of T-Cells in interaction with an idealized antigen presenting cell capable of presenting a single antigen. With agent-based modeling we are able to study the self-organizing dynamics of multiple populations of distinct T-cells which interact via antigen presenting cells that present hundreds of distinct antigens. Moreover, we show that such self-organizing dynamics can be guided to produce an effective binary classification of antigens, which is competitive with existing machine learning methods when applied to biomedical text classification. More specifically, here we test our model on a dataset of publicly available full-text biomedical articles provided by the BioCreative challenge (Krallinger in The biocreative ii. 5 challenge overview, p 19, 2009). We study the robustness of our model's parameter configurations, and show that it leads to encouraging results comparable to state-of-the-art classifiers. Our results help us understand both T-cell cross-regulation as a general principle of guided self-organization, as well as its applicability to document classification. Therefore, we show that our bio-inspired algorithm is a promising novel method for biomedical article classification and for binary document classification in general.",

For these codes, we show that the maximum-likelihood decoding problem is reachable in polynomial time in the code parameters.

	{'abstract': u'In this paper, we consider approximability issues of the following four problems: triangle packing, full sibling reconstruction, maximum profit coverage and 2-coverage. All of them are generalized or specialized versions of set-cover and have applications in biology ranging from full-sibling reconstructions in wild populations to biomolecular clusterings; however, as this paper shows, their approximability properties differ considerably. Our inapproximability constant for the triangle packing problem improves upon the previous results; this is done by directly transforming the inapproximability gap of Haastad for the problem of maximizing the number of satisfied equations for a set of equations over GF(2) and is interesting in its own right. Our approximability results on the full siblings reconstruction problems answers questions originally posed by Berger-Wolf et al. and our results on the maximum profit coverage problem provides almost matching upper and lower bounds on the approximation ratio, answering a question posed by Hassin and Or.',

	{'abstract': u'We study multipath parameter estimation from orthogonal frequency division multiplex signals transmitted over doubly dispersive mobile radio channels. We are interested in cases where the transmission is long enough to suffer time selectivity, but short enough such that the time variation can be accurately modeled as depending only on per-tap linear phase variations due to Doppler effects. We therefore concentrate on the estimation of the complex gain, delay and Doppler offset of each tap of the multipath channel impulse response. We show that the frequency domain channel coefficients for an entire packet can be expressed as the superimposition of two-dimensional complex sinusoids. The maximum likelihood estimate requires solution of a multidimensional non-linear least squares problem, which is computationally infeasible in practice. We therefore propose a low complexity suboptimal solution based on iterative successive and parallel cancellation. First, initial delay/Doppler estimates are obtained via successive cancellation. These estimates are then refined using an iterative parallel cancellation procedure. We demonstrate via Monte Carlo simulations that the root mean squared error statistics of our estimator are very close to the Cramer-Rao lower bound of a single two-dimensional sinusoid in Gaussian noise.',

	{'abstract': u'Set intersection is the core in a variety of problems, e.g. frequent itemset mining and sparse boolean matrix multiplication. It is well-known that large speed gains can, for some computational problems, be obtained by using a graphics processing unit (GPU) as a massively parallel computing device. However, GPUs require highly regular control flow and memory access patterns, and for this reason previous GPU methods for intersecting sets have used a simple bitmap representation. This representation requires excessive space on sparse data sets. In this paper we present a novel data layout, "BatMap", that is particularly well suited for parallel processing, and is compact even for sparse data. Frequent itemset mining is one of the most important applications of set intersection. As a case-study on the potential of BatMaps we focus on frequent pair mining, which is a core special case of frequent itemset mining. The main finding is that our method is able to achieve speedups over both Apriori and FP-growth when the number of distinct items is large, and the density of the problem instance is above 1%. Previous implementations of frequent itemset mining on GPU have not been able to show speedups over the best single-threaded implementations.',

To fulfill this void, we investigate the KNN join problem for high dimensional sparse data. In this paper, we propose three KNN join algorithms: a brute force (BF) algorithm, an inverted index-based(IIB) algorithm and an improved inverted index-based(IIIB) algorithm.

First, we propose a formalization of the problem based on a standard cost sharing model. Second, we show that there is a unique attribution method that satisfies Dummy, Additivity, Conditional Nonnegativity, Affine Scale Invariance, and Anonymity for all characteristic functions that are the sum of a multilinear function and an additive function. We term this the Aumann-Shapley-Shubik method. Conversely, we show that such a uniqueness result does not hold for characteristic functions outside this class. Third, we study multilinear characteristic functions in detail; we describe a computationally efficient implementation of the Aumann-Shapley-Shubik method and discuss practical applications to pay-per-click advertising and portfolio analysis.',

	{'abstract': u'We consider two-hop S-R-D Gaussian networks with a source (S), a relay (R) and a destination (D), some of which experience additive interference. This additive interference, which renders the channels state-dependent, is either a) experienced at the destination D and known non-causally at the source S, or b) experienced at the relay R and known at the destination D. In both cases, one would hope to exploit this knowledge of the channel state at some of the nodes to obtain "clean" or interference-free channels, just as Costa\'s dirty-paper coding does for one-hop channels with state non-causally known to the transmitter. We demonstrate a scheme which achieves to within 0.5 bit of a "clean" channel. This novel scheme is based on nested-lattice code and a Decode-and-Forward (DF) relay. Intuitively, this strategy uses the structure provided by nested lattice codes to cancel the "integer" (or lattice quantized) part of the interference and treats the "residual" (or quantization noise) as noise.',

This approach causes drastic improvement in terms of SNRs with fewer modules compared to the classical modular method. Simulation results clearly confirm the improvement of the proposed method and also its superior robustness against additive noise.',

	{'abstract': u"Threads are a convenient and modular abstraction for writing concurrent programs, but often fairly expensive. The standard alternative to threads, event-loop programming, allows much lighter units of concurrency, but leads to code that is difficult to write and even harder to understand. Continuation Passing C (CPC) is a translator that converts a program written in threaded style into a program written with events and native system threads, at the programmer's choice. Together with two undergraduate students, we taught ourselves how to program in CPC by writing Hekate, a massively concurrent network server designed to efficiently handle tens of thousands of simultaneously connected peers. In this paper, we describe a number of programming idioms that we learnt while writing Hekate; while some of these idioms are specific to CPC, many should be applicable to other programming systems with sufficiently cheap threads.",

	{'abstract': u'Compressed sensing is a novel technique where one can recover sparse signals from the undersampled measurements. In this paper, a measurement matrix for compressed sensing is deterministically constructed via multiplicative character sequences. Precisely, a constant multiple of a cyclic shift of an -ary power residue or Sidelnikov sequence is arranged as a column vector of the matrix, through modulating a primitive -th root of unity. The Weil bound is then used to show that the matrix has asymptotically optimal coherence for large and , and to present a sufficient condition on the sparsity level for unique sparse solution. Also, the restricted isometry property (RIP) is statistically studied for the deterministic matrix. Numerical results show that the deterministic compressed sensing matrix guarantees reliable matching pursuit recovery performance for both noiseless and noisy measurements.',

Second, we prove the language generated by an alphabetic splicing system is context-free.

	{'abstract': u'For discovering the new URI of a missing web page, lexical signatures, which consist of a small number of words chosen to represent the "aboutness" of a page, have been previously proposed. However, prior methods relied on computing the lexical signature before the page was lost, or using cached or archived versions of the page to calculate a lexical signature. We demonstrate a system of constructing a lexical signature for a page from its link neighborhood, that is the "backlinks", or pages that link to the missing page. After testing various methods, we show that one can construct a lexical signature for a missing web page using only ten backlink pages. Further, we show that only the first level of backlinks are useful in this effort. The text that the backlinks use to point to the missing page is used as input for the creation of a four-word lexical signature. That lexical signature is shown to successfully find the target URI in over half of the test cases.',

	{'abstract': u'We establish a classification of decision problems that are to be solved by mobile agents operating in unlabeled graphs, using a deterministic protocol. The classification is with respect to the ability of a team of agents to solve the problem, possibly with the aid of additional information. In particular, our focus is on studying differences between the decidability of a decision problem by agents and its verifiability when a certificate for a positive answer is provided to the agents. We show that the class MAV of mobile agents verifiable problems is much wider than the class MAD of mobile agents decidable problems. Our main result shows that there exist natural MAV-complete problems: the most difficult problems in this class, to which all problems in MAV are reducible. Our construction of a MAV-complete problem involves two main ingredients in mobile agents computability: the topology of the quotient graph and the number of operating agents. Beyond the class MAV we show that, for a single agent, three natural oracles yield a strictly increasing chain of relative decidability classes.',

	{'abstract': u'Information diffusion and influence maximization are important and extensively studied problems in social networks. Various models and algorithms have been proposed in the literature in the context of the influence maximization problem. A crucial assumption in all these studies is that the influence probabilities are known to the social planner. This assumption is unrealistic since the influence probabilities are usually private information of the individual agents and strategic agents may not reveal them truthfully. Moreover, the influence probabilities could vary significantly with the type of the information flowing in the network and the time at which the information is propagating in the network. In this paper, we use a mechanism design approach to elicit influence probabilities truthfully from the agents. We first work with a simple model, the influencer model, where we assume that each user knows the level of influence she has on her neighbors but this is private information. In the second model, the influencer-influencee model, which is more realistic, we determine influence probabilities by combining the probability values reported by the influencers and influencees. In the context of the first model, we present how VCG (Vickrey-Clarke-Groves) mechanisms could be used for truthfully eliciting the influence probabilities. Our main contribution is to design a scoring rule based mechanism in the context of the influencer-influencee model. In particular, we show the incentive compatibility of the mechanisms when the scoring rules are proper and propose a reverse weighted scoring rule based mechanism as an appropriate mechanism to use. We also discuss briefly the implementation of such a mechanism in viral marketing applications.',

	{'abstract': u'The bidirectional Fano algorithm (BFA) can achieve at least two times decoding throughput compared to the conventional unidirectional Fano algorithm (UFA). In this paper, bidirectional Fano decoding is examined from the queuing theory perspective. A Discrete Time Markov Chain (DTMC) is employed to model the BFA decoder with a finite input buffer. The relationship between the input data rate, the input buffer size and the clock speed of the BFA decoder is established. The DTMC based modelling can be used in designing a high throughput parallel BFA decoding system. It is shown that there is a tradeoff between the number of BFA decoders and the input buffer size, and an optimal input buffer size can be chosen to minimize the hardware complexity for a target decoding throughput in designing a high throughput parallel BFA decoding system.',

Our approach follows a scheme of Crochemore et al. based on minimal forbidden words. We extend this construction to the case of C infinity-words, i.e., words differentiable arbitrary many times. We thus obtain an infinite automaton for representing the set of C infinity-words. We derive a classification of C infinity-words induced by the structure of the automaton. Then, we introduce a new framework for dealing with infinity-words, based on a three letter alphabet. This allows us to define a compacted version of the automaton, that we use to prove that every C infinity-word admits a repetition in C infinity whose length is polynomially bounded.',

	{'abstract': u'The ability to predict the intentions of people based solely on their visual actions is a skill only performed by humans and animals. The intelligence of current computer algorithms has not reached this level of complexity, but there are several research efforts that are working towards it. With the number of classification algorithms available, it is hard to determine which algorithm works best for a particular situation. In classification of visual human intent data, Hidden Markov Models (HMM), and their variants, are leading candidates. The inability of HMMs to provide a probability in the observation to observation linkages is a big downfall in this classification technique. If a person is visually identifying an action of another person, they monitor patterns in the observations. By estimating the next observation, people have the ability to summarize the actions, and thus determine, with pretty good accuracy, the intention of the person performing the action. These visual cues and linkages are important in creating intelligent algorithms for determining human actions based on visual observations. The Evidence Feed Forward Hidden Markov Model is a newly developed algorithm which provides observation to observation linkages. The following research addresses the theory behind Evidence Feed Forward HMMs, provides mathematical proofs of their learning of these parameters to optimize the likelihood of observations with a Evidence Feed Forwards HMM, which is important in all computational intelligence algorithm, and gives comparative examples with standard HMMs in classification of both visual action data and measurement data; thus providing a strong base for Evidence Feed Forward HMMs in classification of many types of problems.',

	{'abstract': u'The growing complexity of software systems as well as changing conditions in their operating environment demand systems that are more flexible, adaptive and dependable. The service-oriented computing paradigm is in widespread use to support such adaptive systems, and, in many domains, adaptations may occur dynamically and in real time. In addition, services from heterogeneous, possibly unknown sources may be used. This motivates a need to ensure the correct behaviour of the adapted systems, and its continuing compliance to time bounds and other QoS properties. The complexity of dynamic adaptation (DA) is significant, but currently not well understood or formally specified. This paper elaborates a well-founded model and theory of DA, introducing formalisms written using COWS. The model is evaluated for reliability and responsiveness properties with the model checker CMC.',

The investigation is carried-out through an extensive simulation study of the effectiveness of the LFSR based digital circuit testing technique. The results of the study show that when the identical characteristic polynomials of order n are used in both pseudo-random test-pattern generator, as well as in Multi-Input Shift Register (MISR) signature analyzer (parallel type) then the probability of aliasing errors remains unchanged due to the changes in the initial loadings of the pseudo-random test-pattern generator.',

	{'abstract': u'The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is widely recognized as the most important block cipher in common use nowadays. This high assurance in AES is given by its resistance to ten years of extensive cryptanalysis, that has shown no weakness, not even any deviation from the statistical behaviour expected from a random permutation. Only reduced versions of the ciphers have been broken, but they are not usually implemented. In this paper we build a distinguishing attack on the AES, exploiting the properties of a novel cipher embedding. With our attack we give some statistical evidence that the set of AES- encryptions acts on the message space in a way significantly different than that of the set of random permutations acting on the same space. While we feel that more computational experiments by independent third parties are needed in order to validate our statistical results, we show that the non-random behaviour is the same as we would predict using the property of our embedding. Indeed, the embedding lowers the nonlinearity of the AES rounds and therefore the AES encryptions tend, on average, to keep low the rank of low-rank matrices constructed in the large space. Our attack needs plaintext-ciphertext pairs and costs the equivalent of encryptions. We expect our attack to work also for AES- and AES-, as confirmed by preliminary experiments.',

We show that the so-called double chain is 2-color universal for paths if each of the two chains contains at least one fifth of all the points, but not if one of the chains is more than approximately 28 times longer than the other. A 2-coloring of G is equitable if the sizes of the color classes differ by at most 1. A bipartite graph is equitable if it admits an equitable proper coloring. We study the case when S is the double-chain with chain sizes differing by at most 1 and G is an equitable bipartite graph. We prove that this S is not 2-color universal if G is not a forest of caterpillars and that it is 2-color universal for equitable caterpillars with at most one half non-leaf vertices. We also show that if this S is equitably 2-colored, then equitably properly 2-colored forests of stars can be embedded on it.',

	{'abstract': u'The celebrated dimension reduction lemma of Johnson and Lindenstrauss has numerous computational and other applications. Due to its application in practice, speeding up the computation of a Johnson-Lindenstrauss style dimension reduction is an important question. Recently, Dasgupta, Kumar, and Sarlos (STOC 2010) constructed such a transform that uses a sparse matrix. This is motivated by the desire to speed up the computation when applied to sparse input vectors, a scenario that comes up in applications. The sparsity of their construction was further improved by Kane and Nelson (ArXiv 2010). We improve the previous bound on the number of non-zero entries per column of Kane and Nelson from (where the target dimension is , the distortion is , and the failure probability is ) to O left( left( right)^2 right). We also improve the amount of randomness needed to generate the matrix. Our results are obtained by connecting the moments of an order 2 Rademacher chaos to the combinatorial properties of random Eulerian multigraphs. Estimating the chance that a random multigraph is composed of a given number of node-disjoint Eulerian components leads to a new tail bound on the chaos. Our estimates may be of independent interest, and as this part of the argument is decoupled from the analysis of the coefficients of the chaos, we believe that our methods can be useful in the analysis of other chaoses.',

The entire array evolves in discrete time steps by iterating a global evolution G. Further, this global evolution G is required to be shift-invariant (it acts the same everywhere) and causal (information cannot be transmitted faster than some fixed number of cells per time step). At least in the classical, reversible and quantum cases, these two top-down axiomatic conditions are sufficient to entail more bottom-up, operational descriptions of G.

	{'abstract': u'The Small-Set Expansion Hypothesis (Raghavendra, Steurer, STOC 2010) is a natural hardness assumption concerning the problem of approximating the edge expansion of small sets in graphs. This hardness assumption is closely connected to the Unique Games Conjecture (Khot, STOC 2002). In particular, the Small-Set Expansion Hypothesis implies the Unique Games Conjecture (Raghavendra, Steurer, STOC 2010). Our main result is that the Small-Set Expansion Hypothesis is in fact equivalent to a variant of the Unique Games Conjecture. More precisely, the hypothesis is equivalent to the Unique Games Conjecture restricted to instance with a fairly mild condition on the expansion of small sets. Alongside, we obtain the first strong hardness of approximation results for the Balanced Separator and Minimum Linear Arrangement problems. Before, no such hardness was known for these problems even assuming the Unique Games Conjecture. These results not only establish the Small-Set Expansion Hypothesis as a natural unifying hypothesis that implies the Unique Games Conjecture, all its consequences and, in addition, hardness results for other problems like Balanced Separator and Minimum Linear Arrangement, but our results also show that the Small-Set Expansion Hypothesis problem lies at the combinatorial heart of the Unique Games Conjecture. The key technical ingredient is a new way of exploiting the structure of the Unique Games instances obtained from the Small-Set Expansion Hypothesis via (Raghavendra, Steurer, 2010). This additional structure allows us to modify standard reductions in a way that essentially destroys their local-gadget nature. Using this modification, we can argue about the expansion in the graphs produced by the reduction without relying on expansion properties of the underlying Unique Games instance (which would be impossible for a local-gadget reduction).',

	{'abstract': u'It is a challenging task to select correlated variables in a high dimensional space. To address this challenge, the elastic net has been developed and successfully applied to many applications. Despite its great success, the elastic net does not explicitly use correlation information embedded in data to select correlated variables. To overcome this limitation, we present a novel Bayesian hybrid model, the EigenNet, that uses the eigenstructures of data to guide variable selection. Specifically, it integrates a sparse conditional classification model with a generative model capturing variable correlations in a principled Bayesian framework. We reparameterize the hybrid model in the eigenspace to avoid overfiting and to increase the computational efficiency of its MCMC sampler. Furthermore, we provide an alternative view to the EigenNet from a regularization perspective: the EigenNet has an adaptive eigenspace-based composite regularizer, which naturally generalizes the regularizer used by the elastic net. Experiments on synthetic and real data show that the EigenNet significantly outperforms the lasso, the elastic net, and the Bayesian lasso in terms of prediction accuracy, especially when the number of training samples is smaller than the number of variables.',

	{'abstract': u'We study the problem of privacy amplification with an active adversary in the information theoretic setting. In this setting, two parties Alice and Bob start out with a shared -bit weak random string , and try to agree on a secret random key over a public channel fully controlled by an active and unbounded adversary. Typical assumptions are that these two parties have access to local private uniform random bits. In this paper we seek to minimize the requirements on the local randomness used by the two parties. We make two improvements over previous results. First, we reduce the number of random bits needed for each party to , where is the security parameter, as long as has min-entropy . Previously, the best known result needs to use bits. Our result is also asymptotically optimal. Second, we generalize the problem to the case where the two parties only have local weak random sources instead of truly uniform random bits. We show that when each party has a local weak random source with min-entropy , there is an efficient privacy amplification protocol that works nearly as good as if the two parties have access to local uniform random bits. Next, in the case where each party only has a weak random source with arbitrarily linear min-entropy, we give an efficient privacy amplification protocol where we can achieve security parameter up to . Our results give the first protocols that achieve privacy amplification when each party only has access to a local weak random source.',

We identify several classes of curves C that "live on a cone," in the sense that C and a neighborhood to one side may be isometrically embedded on the surface of a cone Lambda, with the apex a of Lambda enclosed inside (the image of) C; we also prove that each point of C is "visible to" a. In particular, we obtain that these curves have non-self-intersecting developments in the plane. Moreover, the curves we identify that live on cones to both sides support a new type of "source unfolding" of the entire surface of P to one non-overlapping piece, as reported in a companion paper.',

A general form of the scheme for a specific linear inhomogeneous equation is shown. The method is applied to the wave equation and the diffuse equation and is investigated by simulating simple models. The numerical solutions of the proposed method show good agreement to the exact solutions. Comparing with explicit FDM, FDM shows the instability by the violation of CFL condition whereas the proposed method is always stable irrespective of any time step width.',

	{'abstract': u'In this paper we show that when individuals in a bipartite network exclusively choose partners and exchange valued goods with their partners, then there exists a set of exchanges that are pair-wise stable. Pair-wise stability implies that no individual breaks her partnership and no two neighbors in the network can form a new partnership while breaking other partnerships if any so that at least one of them improves her payoff and the other one does at least as good. We consider a general class of continuous, strictly convex and strongly monotone preferences over bundles of goods for individuals. Thus, this work extends the general equilibrium framework from markets to networks with exclusive exchanges. We present the complete existence proof using the existence of a generalized stable matching in cite. The existence proof can be extended to problems in social games as in cite and cite.',

	{'abstract': u'A state-dependent relay channel is studied in which strictly causal channel state information is available at the relay and no state information is available at the source and destination. The source and the relay are connected via two unidirectional out-of-band orthogonal links of finite capacity, and a state-dependent memoryless channel connects the source and the relay, on one side, and the destination, on the other. Via the orthogonal links, the source can convey information about the message to be delivered to the destination to the relay while the relay can forward state information to the source. This exchange enables cooperation between the source and the relay on transmission of message and state information to the destination. First, two achievable schemes are proposed that exploit both message and state cooperation. It is shown that a transmission scheme inspired by noisy network coding performs better than a strategy based on block Markov coding and backward decoding. Next, based on the given achievable schemes and appropriate upper bounds, capacity results are identified for some special cases. Finally, a Gaussian model is studied, along with corresponding numerical results that illuminate the relative merits of state and message cooperation.',

	{'abstract': u'Over the last decade there have been great strides made in developing techniques to compute functions privately. In particular, Differential Privacy gives strong promises about conclusions that can be drawn about an individual. In contrast, various syntactic methods for providing privacy (criteria such as kanonymity and l-diversity) have been criticized for still allowing private information of an individual to be inferred. In this report, we consider the ability of an attacker to use data meeting privacy definitions to build an accurate classifier. We demonstrate that even under Differential Privacy, such classifiers can be used to accurately infer "private" attributes in realistic data. We compare this to similar approaches for inferencebased attacks on other forms of anonymized data. We place these attacks on the same scale, and observe that the accuracy of inference of private attributes for Differentially Private data and l-diverse data can be quite similar.',

Behaviours are specified with a timed CCS-like process algebra using a notion of channel that models naturally binding sites on the surface of shapes. Processes can represent molecules or other mobile objects and can be part of networks of processes that move simultaneously and interact in a given geometrical space. The calculus embeds collision detection and response, binding of compatible 3D processes and splitting of previously established bonds. In this work the full formal timed operational semantics of the calculus is provided, together with examples that illustrate the use of the calculus in a well-known biological scenario. Moreover, a result of well-formedness about the evolution of a given network of well-formed 3D processes is proved.',

	{'abstract': u'The linear-algebraic lambda-calculus and the algebraic lambda-calculus are untyped lambda-calculi extended with arbitrary linear combinations of terms. The former presents the axioms of linear algebra in the form of a rewrite system, while the latter uses equalities. When given by rewrites, algebraic lambda-calculi are not confluent unless further restrictions are added. We provide a type system for the linear-algebraic lambda-calculus enforcing strong normalisation, which gives back confluence. The type system allows an abstract interpretation in System F.',

	{'abstract': u'We study sorting algorithms based on randomized round-robin comparisons. Specifically, we study Spin-the-bottle sort, where comparisons are unrestricted, and Annealing sort, where comparisons are restricted to a distance bounded by a emph parameter. Both algorithms are simple, randomized, data-oblivious sorting algorithms, which are useful in privacy-preserving computations, but, as we show, Annealing sort is much more efficient. We show that there is an input permutation that causes Spin-the-bottle sort to require expected time in order to succeed, and that in time this algorithm succeeds with high probability for any input. We also show there is an implementation of Annealing sort that runs in time and succeeds with very high probability.',

	{'abstract': u"We consider the problem of designing a revenue-maximizing auction for a single item, when the values of the bidders are drawn from a correlated distribution. We observe that there exists an algorithm that finds the optimal randomized mechanism that runs in time polynomial in the size of the support. We leverage this result to show that in the oracle model introduced by Ronen and Saberi [FOCS'02], there exists a polynomial time truthful in expectation mechanism that provides a -approximation to the revenue achievable by an optimal truthful-in-expectation mechanism, and a polynomial time deterministic truthful mechanism that guarantees approximation to the revenue achievable by an optimal deterministic truthful mechanism. We show that the -approximation mechanism provides the same approximation ratio also with respect to the optimal truthful-in-expectation mechanism. This shows that the performance gap between truthful-in-expectation and deterministic mechanisms is relatively small. En route, we solve an open question of Mehta and Vazirani [EC'04]. Finally, we extend some of our results to the multi-item case, and show how to compute the optimal truthful-in-expectation mechanisms for bidders with more complex valuations.",

	{'abstract': u'In this paper we show that gossip algorithms may be effectively used to disseminate game events in Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Multiplayer Online Games (MOGs). Game events are disseminated through an overlay network. The proposed scheme exploits the typical behavior of players to tune the data dissemination. In fact, it is well known that users playing a MOG typically generate game events at a rate that can be approximated using some (game dependent) probability distribution. Hence, as soon as a given node experiences a reception rate, for messages coming from a given peer, which is lower than expected, it can send a stimulus to the neighbor that usually forwards these messages, asking it to increase its dissemination probability. Three variants of this approach will be studied. According to the first one, upon reception of a stimulus from a neighbor, a peer increases its dissemination probability towards that node irrespectively from the sender. In the second protocol a peer increases only the dissemination probability for a given sender towards all its neighbors. Finally, the third protocol takes into consideration both the sender and the neighbor in order to decide how to increase the dissemination probability. We performed extensive simulations to assess the efficacy of the proposed scheme, and based on the simulation results we compare the different dissemination protocols. The results confirm that adaptive gossip schemes are indeed effective and deserve further investigation.',

	{'abstract': u"One of the main research areas in Artificial Intelligence is the coding of agents (programs) which are able to learn by themselves in any situation. This means that agents must be useful for purposes other than those they were created for, as, for example, playing chess. In this way we try to get closer to the pristine goal of Artificial Intelligence. One of the problems to decide whether an agent is really intelligent or not is the measurement of its intelligence, since there is currently no way to measure it in a reliable way. The purpose of this project is to create an interpreter that allows for the execution of several environments, including those which are generated randomly, so that an agent (a person or a program) can interact with them. Once the interaction between the agent and the environment is over, the interpreter will measure the intelligence of the agent according to the actions, states and rewards the agent has undergone inside the environment during the test. As a result we will be able to measure agents' intelligence in any possible environment, and to make comparisons between several agents, in order to determine which of them is the most intelligent. In order to perform the tests, the interpreter must be able to randomly generate environments that are really useful to measure agents' intelligence, since not any randomly generated environment will serve that purpose.",

	{'abstract': u"Regenerating codes are a class of recently developed codes for distributed storage that, like Reed-Solomon codes, permit data recovery from any subset of k nodes within the n-node network. However, regenerating codes possess in addition, the ability to repair a failed node by connecting to an arbitrary subset of d nodes. It has been shown that for the case of functional-repair, there is a tradeoff between the amount of data stored per node and the bandwidth required to repair a failed node. A special case of functional-repair is exact-repair where the replacement node is required to store data identical to that in the failed node. Exact-repair is of interest as it greatly simplifies system implementation. The first result of the paper is an explicit, exact-repair code for the point on the storage-bandwidth tradeoff corresponding to the minimum possible repair bandwidth, for the case when d=n-1. This code has a particularly simple graphical description and most interestingly, has the ability to carry out exact-repair through mere transfer of data and without any need to perform arithmetic operations. Hence the term `repair-by-transfer'. The second result of this paper shows that the interior points on the storage-bandwidth tradeoff cannot be achieved under exact-repair, thus pointing to the existence of a separate tradeoff under exact-repair. Specifically, we identify a set of scenarios, termed `helper node pooling', and show that it is the necessity to satisfy such scenarios that over-constrains the system.",

	{'abstract': u'We consider the problem of universally communicating over an unknown and arbitrarily varying channel, using feedback. The focus of this paper is on determining the input behavior, and specifically, a prior distribution which is used to randomly generate the codebook. We pose the problem of setting the prior as a sequential universal prediction problem, that attempts to approach a given target rate, which depends on the unknown channel sequence. The main result is that, for a channel comprised of an unknown, arbitrary sequence of memoryless channels, there is a system using feedback and common randomness that asymptotically attains, with high probability, the capacity of the time-averaged channel, universally for every sequence of channels. While no prior knowledge of the channel sequence is assumed, the rate achieved meets or exceeds the traditional arbitrarily varying channel (AVC) capacity for every memoryless AVC defined over the same alphabets, and therefore the system universally attains the random code AVC capacity, without knowledge of the AVC parameters. The system we present combines rateless coding with a universal prediction scheme for the prior. We present rough upper bounds on the rates that can be achieved in this setting and lower bounds for the redundancies.',

	{'abstract': u'The availability of end-hosts and their assigned routable IP addresses has impact on the ability to fight spammers and attackers, and on peer-to-peer application performance. Previous works study the availability of hosts mostly by using either active pinging or by studying access to a mail service, both approaches suffer from inherent inaccuracies. We take a different approach by measuring the IP addresses periodically reported by a uniquely identified group of the hosts running the DIMES agent. This fresh approach provides a chance to measure the true availability of end-hosts and the dynamics of their assigned routable IP addresses. Using a two month study of 1804 hosts, we find that over 60% of the hosts have a fixed IP address and 90% median availability, while some of the remaining hosts have more than 30 different IPs. For those that have periodically changing IP addresses, we find that the median average period per AS is roughly 24 hours, with a strong relation between the offline time and the probability of altering IP address.',

The main idea is encoding relevant dynamical properties as conditions on the high order Lie derivatives of polynomials occurring in the SAI. A direct consequence of this criterion is a relatively complete method of SAI generation based on template assumption and semi-algebraic constraint solving. Relative completeness means if there is an SAI in the form of a predefined template, then our method can indeed find one using this template.',

	{'abstract': u'This paper presents a novel technique for state space reduction of probabilistic specifications, based on a newly developed notion of confluence for probabilistic automata. We prove that this reduction preserves branching probabilistic bisimulation and can be applied on-the-fly. To support the technique, we introduce a method for detecting confluent transitions in the context of a probabilistic process algebra with data, facilitated by an earlier defined linear format. A case study demonstrates that significant reductions can be obtained.',

	{'abstract': u"Online Social Networks (OSNs) have witnessed a tremendous growth the last few years, becoming a platform for online users to communicate, exchange content and even find employment. The emergence of OSNs has attracted researchers and analysts and much data-driven research has been conducted. However, collecting data-sets is non-trivial and sometimes it is difficult for data-sets to be shared between researchers. The main contribution of this paper is a framework called SONG (Social Network Write Generator) to generate synthetic traces of write activity on OSNs. We build our framework based on a characterization study of a large Twitter data-set and identifying the important factors that need to be accounted for. We show how one can generate traces with SONG and validate it by comparing against real data. We discuss how one can extend and use SONG to explore different `what-if' scenarios. We build a Twitter clone using 16 machines and Cassandra. We then show by example the usefulness of SONG by stress-testing our implementation. We hope that SONG is used by researchers and analysts for their own work that involves write activity.",

	{'abstract': u'Information about primary transmitter location is crucial in enabling several key capabilities in cognitive radio networks, including improved spatio-temporal sensing, intelligent location-aware routing, as well as aiding spectrum policy enforcement. Compared to other proposed non-interactive localization algorithms, the weighted centroid localization (WCL) scheme uses only the received signal strength information, which makes it simple to implement and robust to variations in the propagation environment. In this paper we present the first theoretical framework for WCL performance analysis in terms of its localization error distribution parameterized by node density, node placement, shadowing variance, correlation distance and inaccuracy of sensor node positioning. Using this analysis, we quantify the robustness of WCL to various physical conditions and provide design guidelines, such as node placement and spacing, for the practical deployment of WCL. We also propose a power-efficient method for implementing WCL through a distributed cluster-based algorithm, that achieves comparable accuracy with its centralized counterpart.',

	{'abstract': u"Since its emergence in the 1990s the World Wide Web (WWW) has rapidly evolved into a huge mine of global information and it is growing in size everyday. The presence of huge amount of resources on the Web thus poses a serious problem of accurate search. This is mainly because today's Web is a human-readable Web where information cannot be easily processed by machine. Highly sophisticated, efficient keyword based search engines that have evolved today have not been able to bridge this gap. So comes up the concept of the Semantic Web which is envisioned by Tim Berners-Lee as the Web of machine interpretable information to make a machine processable form for expressing information. Based on the semantic Web technologies we present in this paper the design methodology and development of a semantic Web search engine which provides exact search results for a domain specific search. This search engine is developed for an agricultural Website which hosts agricultural information about the state of West Bengal.",

	{'abstract': u'This paper aims at providing a rigorous definition of self- organization, one of the most desired properties for dynamic systems (e.g., peer-to-peer systems, sensor networks, cooperative robotics, or ad-hoc networks). We characterize different classes of self-organization through liveness and safety properties that both capture information re- garding the system entropy. We illustrate these classes through study cases. The first ones are two representative P2P overlays (CAN and Pas- try) and the others are specific implementations of Omega (the leader oracle) and one-shot query abstractions for dynamic settings. Our study aims at understanding the limits and respective power of existing self-organized protocols and lays the basis of designing robust algorithm for dynamic systems.',

	{'abstract': u"The existing search engines sometimes give unsatisfactory search result for lack of any categorization of search result. If there is some means to know the preference of user about the search result and rank pages according to that preference, the result will be more useful and accurate to the user. In the present paper a web page ranking algorithm is being proposed based on syntactic classification of web pages. Syntactic Classification does not bother about the meaning of the content of a web page. The proposed approach mainly consists of three steps: select some properties of web pages based on user's demand, measure them, and give different weightage to each property during ranking for different types of pages. The existence of syntactic classification is supported by running fuzzy c-means algorithm and neural network classification on a set of web pages. The change in ranking for difference in type of pages but for same query string is also being demonstrated.",

First we show that the axiomatic system given by Shen cannot be weakened (at least in any natural way). We then give an analogue of Shen's axiomatic system for conditional complexity. In a the second part of the paper, we look at prefix-free complexity and try to construct an axiomatic system for it. We show however that the natural analogues of Shen's axiomatic systems fails to characterize prefix-free complexity.",

	{'abstract': u"The growth of the World Wide Web has emphasized the need for improvement in user latency. One of the techniques that are used for improving user latency is Caching and another is Web Prefetching. Approaches that bank solely on caching offer limited performance improvement because it is difficult for caching to handle the large number of increasingly diverse files. Studies have been conducted on prefetching models based on decision trees, Markov chains, and path analysis. However, the increased uses of dynamic pages, frequent changes in site structure and user access patterns have limited the efficacy of these static techniques. In this paper, we have proposed a methodology to cluster related pages into different categories based on the access patterns. Additionally we use page ranking to build up our prediction model at the initial stages when users haven't already started sending requests. This way we have tried to overcome the problems of maintaining huge databases which is needed in case of log based techniques.",

Since WBAN nodes are used to collect sensitive (life-critical) information and may operate in hostile environments, they require strict security mechanisms to prevent malicious interaction with the system. In this paper, we first highlight major security requirements and Denial of Service (DoS) attacks in WBAN at Physical, Medium Access Control (MAC), Network, and Transport layers. Then we discuss the IEEE 802.15.4 security framework and identify the security vulnerabilities and major attacks in the context of WBAN. Different types of attacks on the Contention Access Period (CAP) and Contention Free Period (CFP) parts of the superframe are analyzed and discussed. It is observed that a smart attacker can successfully corrupt an increasing number of GTS slots in the CFP period and can considerably affect the Quality of Service (QoS) in WBAN (since most of the data is carried in CFP period). As we increase the number of smart attackers the corrupted GTS slots are eventually increased, which prevents the legitimate nodes to utilize the bandwidth efficiently. This means that the direct adaptation of IEEE 802.15.4 security framework for WBAN is not totally secure for certain WBAN applications. New solutions are required to integrate high level security in WBAN.',

	{'abstract': u'This paper concerns the forward kinematics and tension distribution of sinking winches mechanism, which is a type of four-cable-driven partly constrained parallel robot. Conventional studies on forward kinematics of cable-driven parallel robot assumed that all cables are taut. Actually, given the lengths of four cables, some cables may be slack when the platform is in static equilibrium. Therefore, in this paper, the tension state (tautness or slackness) of cables is considered in the forward kinematics model. We propose Traversal-Solving-Algorithm, which can indicate the tension state of cables, and further determine the pose of the platform, if the lengths of four cables are given. The effectiveness of the algorithm is verified by four examples. The results of this paper can be used to control sinking winches mechanism to achieve the level and stable motion of the platform, and to make the tension distribution of cables as uniform as possible.',

Downloading even a fraction of this mammoth data is like sailing through a huge ocean and it is a challenging task indeed. In order to download a large portion of data from WWW, it has become absolutely essential to make the crawling process parallel. In this paper we offer the architecture of a dynamic parallel Web crawler, christened as "WEB-SAILOR," which presents a scalable approach based on Client-Server model to speed up the download process on behalf of a Web Search Engine in a distributed Domain-set specific environment. WEB-SAILOR removes the possibility of overlapping of downloaded documents by multiple crawlers without even incurring the cost of communication overhead among several parallel "client" crawling processes.',

	{'abstract': u'Gliomas are the most common primary brain tumors, evolving from the cerebral supportive cells. For clinical follow-up, the evaluation of the preoperative tumor volume is essential. Volumetric assessment of tumor volume with manual segmentation of its outlines is a time-consuming process that can be overcome with the help of computer-assisted segmentation methods. In this paper, a semi-automatic approach for World Health Organization (WHO) grade IV glioma segmentation is introduced that uses balloon inflation forces, and relies on the detection of high-intensity tumor boundaries that are coupled by using contrast agent gadolinium. The presented method is evaluated on 27 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data sets and the ground truth data of the tumor boundaries - for evaluation of the results - are manually extracted by neurosurgeons.',

This problem, albeit well studied, can still be considered an open one, given the problems faced by software development organizations. Trying to solve this problem, Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) is a specification technique that automatically certifies that all functional requirements are treated properly by source code, through the connection of the textual description of these requirements to automated tests. However, in some areas, such as Enterprise Information Systems, requirements are identified by Business Process Modeling - which uses graphical notations of the underlying business processes. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to present Business Language Driven Development (BLDD), a method that aims to extend BDD, by connecting business process models directly to source code, while keeping the expressiveness of text descriptions when they are better fitted than graphical artifacts.',

This paper proposes a general approach to study that evolution for both atemporal and temporal indicators, based respectively on sequences of static graphs and sequences of time-varying graphs that cover successive time-windows.

	{'abstract': u'This paper describes and analyzes a hierarchical gossip algorithm for solving the distributed average consensus problem in wireless sensor networks. The network is recursively partitioned into subnetworks. Initially, nodes at the finest scale gossip to compute local averages. Then, using geographic routing to enable gossip between nodes that are not directly connected, these local averages are progressively fused up the hierarchy until the global average is computed. We show that the proposed hierarchical scheme with levels of hierarchy is competitive with state-of-the-art randomized gossip algorithms, in terms of message complexity, achieving -accuracy with high probability after messages. Key to our analysis is the way in which the network is recursively partitioned. We find that the optimal scaling law is achieved when subnetworks at scale contain nodes; then the message complexity at any individual scale is , and the total number of scales in the hierarchy grows slowly, as . Another important consequence of hierarchical construction is that the longest distance over which messages are exchanged is hops (at the highest scale), and most messages (at lower scales) travel shorter distances. In networks that use link-level acknowledgements, this results in less congestion and resource usage by reducing message retransmissions. Simulations illustrate that the proposed scheme is more message-efficient than existing state-of-the-art randomized gossip algorithms based on averaging along paths.',

	{'abstract': u'We present controllers that enable mobile robots to persistently monitor or sweep a changing environment. The changing environment is modeled as a field which grows in locations that are not within range of a robot, and decreases in locations that are within range of a robot. We assume that the robots travel on given closed paths. The speed of each robot along its path is controlled to prevent the field from growing unbounded at any location. We consider the space of speed controllers that can be parametrized by a finite set of basis functions. For a single robot, we develop a linear program that is guaranteed to compute a speed controller in this space to keep the field bounded, if such a controller exists. Another linear program is then derived whose solution is the speed controller that minimizes the maximum field value over the environment. We extend our linear program formulation to develop a multi-robot controller that keeps the field bounded. The multi-robot controller has the unique feature that it does not require communication among the robots. Simulation studies demonstrate the robustness of the controllers to modeling errors, and to stochasticity in the environment.',

Consequently, there is now a body of empirical studies describing topological characteristics of protein macro-molecules through their contact networks and linking these topological characteristics to protein folding. The present paper is primarily a review of this rich area. But it delves deeper into certain aspects by emphasizing short-range and long-range links, and suggests unconventional places where "power-laws" may be lurking within protein contact networks. Further, it considers the dynamical view of protein contact networks. This closer scrutiny of protein contact networks raises new questions for further research, and identifies new regularities which may be useful to parameterize a network approach to protein folding. Preliminary experiments with such a model confirm that the regularities we identified cannot be easily reproduced through random effects. Indeed, the grand challenge of protein folding is to elucidate the process(es) which not only generates the specific and diverse linkage patterns of protein contact networks, but also reproduces the dynamic behavior of proteins as they fold. Keywords: network analysis, protein contact networks, protein folding',

	{'abstract': u'We study the degrees of freedom (DoF) regions of two-user multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) Z and full interference channels in this paper. We assume that the receivers always have perfect channel state information. We first derive the DoF region of Z interference channel with channel state information at transmitter (CSIT). For full interference channel without CSIT, the DoF region has been fully characterized recently and it is shown that the previously known outer bound is not achievable. In this work, we investigate the no-CSIT case further by assuming that the transmitter has the ability of antenna mode switching. We obtain the DoF region as a function of the number of available antenna modes and reveal the incremental gain in DoF that each extra antenna mode can bring. It is shown that in certain cases the reconfigurable antennas can bring extra DoF gains. In these cases, the DoF region is maximized when the number of modes is at least equal to the number of receive antennas at the corresponding receiver, in which case the previously outer bound is achieved. In all cases, we propose systematic constructions of the beamforming and nulling matrices for achieving the DoF region. The constructions bear an interesting space-frequency interpretation.',

	{'abstract': u'For information transmission a binary symmetric channel is used. There is also another noisy binary symmetric channel (feedback channel), and the transmitter observes without delay all the outputs of the forward channel via that feedback channel. The transmission of an exponential number of messages (i.e. the transmission rate is positive) is considered. The achievable decoding error exponent for such a combination of channels is investigated. It is shown that if the crossover probability of the feedback channel is less than a certain positive value, then the achievable error exponent is better than the decoding error exponent of the channel without feedback.',

	{'abstract': u"Motivated by the concept of probe storage, we study the problem of information retrieval using a large array of N nano-mechanical probes, N ~ 4000. At the nanometer scale it is impossible to avoid errors in the positioning of the array, thus all signals retrieved by the probes of the array at a given sampling moment are affected by the same amount of random position jitter. Therefore a massively parallel probe storage device is an example of a noisy communication channel with long range correlations between channel outputs due to the global positioning errors. We find that these correlations have a profound effect on the channel's properties. For example, it turns out that the channel's information capacity does approach 1 bit per probe in the limit of high signal-to-noise ratio, but the rate of the approach is only polynomial in the channel noise strength. Moreover, any error correction code with block size N &gt;&gt; 1 such that codewords correspond to the instantaneous outputs of the all probes in the array exhibits an error floor independently of the code rate. We illustrate this phenomenon explicitly using Reed-Solomon codes the performance of which is easy to simulate numerically. We also discuss capacity-achieving error correction codes for the global jitter channel and their complexity.",

	{'abstract': u'We present an uncertainty relation for the representation of signals in two different general (possibly redundant or incomplete) signal sets. This uncertainty relation is relevant for the analysis of signals containing two distinct features each of which can be described sparsely in a suitable general signal set. Furthermore, the new uncertainty relation is shown to lead to improved sparsity thresholds for recovery of signals that are sparse in general dictionaries. Specifically, our results improve on the well-known -threshold for dictionaries with coherence by up to a factor of two. Furthermore, we provide probabilistic recovery guarantees for pairs of general dictionaries that also allow us to understand which parts of a general dictionary one needs to randomize over to "weed out" the sparsity patterns that prohibit breaking the square-root bottleneck.',

	{'abstract': u'A central theme in distributed network algorithms concerns understanding and coping with the issue of locality. Inspired by sequential complexity theory, we focus on a complexity theory for distributed decision problems. In the context of locality, solving a decision problem requires the processors to independently inspect their local neighborhoods and then collectively decide whether a given global input instance belongs to some specified language. This paper introduces several classes of distributed decision problems, proves separation among them and presents some complete problems. More specifically, we consider the standard LOCAL model of computation and define LD (for local decision) as the class of decision problems that can be solved in constant number of communication rounds. We first study the intriguing question of whether randomization helps in local distributed computing, and to what extent. Specifically, we define the corresponding randomized class BPLD, and ask whether LD=BPLD. We provide a partial answer to this question by showing that in many cases, randomization does not help for deciding hereditary languages. In addition, we define the notion of local many-one reductions, and introduce the (nondeterministic) class NLD of decision problems for which there exists a certificate that can be verified in constant number of communication rounds. We prove that there exists an NLD-complete problem. We also show that there exist problems not in NLD. On the other hand, we prove that the class NLD#n, which is NLD assuming that each processor can access an oracle that provides the number of nodes in the network, contains all (decidable) languages. For this class we provide a natural complete problem as well.',

	{'abstract': u'It is well known that a stable matching in a many-to-one matching market with couples need not exist. We introduce a new matching algorithm for such markets and show that for a general class of large random markets the algorithm will find a stable matching with high probability. In particular we allow the number of couples to grow at a near-linear rate. Furthermore, truth-telling is an approximated equilibrium in the game induced by the new matching algorithm. Our results are tight: for markets in which the number of couples grows at a linear rate, we show that with constant probability no stable matching exists.',

	{'abstract': u"Cooperative communications is a class of techniques which seek to improve reliability and throughput in wireless systems by pooling the resources of distributed nodes. While cooperation can occur at different network layers and time scales, physical layer cooperation at symbol time scales offers the largest benefit in combating losses due to fading. However, symbol level cooperation poses significant implementation challenges, especially in synchronizing the behaviors and carrier frequencies of distributed nodes. We present the implementation and characterization of a complete, real-time cooperative physical layer transceiver built on the Rice Wireless Open-Access Research Platform (WARP). In our implementation autonomous nodes employ physical layer cooperation without a central synchronization source, and are capable of selecting between non-cooperative and cooperative communication per packet. Cooperative transmissions use a distributed Alamouti space-time block code and employ either amplify-and-forward or decode-and-forward relaying. We also present experimental results of our transceiver's real-time performance under a variety of topologies and propagation conditions. Our results clearly demonstrate significant performance gains (more than 40x improvement in PER in some topologies) provided by physical layer cooperation, even when subject to the constraints of a real-time implementation. We also present methodologies to isolate and understand the sources of performance bottlenecks in our design. As with all our work on WARP, our transceiver design and experimental framework are available via the open-source WARP repository for use by other wireless researchers.",

	{'abstract': u'We investigate the problem of secure communication over parallel relay channel in the presence of a passive eavesdropper. We consider a four terminal relay-eavesdropper channel which consists of multiple relay-eavesdropper channels as subchannels. For the discrete memoryless model, we establish outer and inner bounds on the rate-equivocation region. The inner bound allows mode selection at the relay. For each subchannel, secure transmission is obtained through one of two coding schemes at the relay: decoding-and-forwarding the source message or confusing the eavesdropper through noise injection. For the Gaussian memoryless channel, we establish lower and upper bounds on the perfect secrecy rate. Furthermore, we study a special case in which the relay does not hear the source and show that under certain conditions the lower and upper bounds coincide. The results established for the parallel Gaussian relay-eavesdropper channel are then applied to study the fading relay-eavesdropper channel. Analytical results are illustrated through some numerical examples.',

	{'abstract': u'A-posteriori probability (APP) receivers operating over multiple-input, multiple-output channels provide enhanced bit error rate (BER) performance at the cost of increased complexity. However, employing full APP processing over favorable transmission environments, where less efficient approaches may already provide the required performance at a reduced complexity, results in unnecessary processing. For slowly varying channel statistics substantial complexity savings can be achieved by simple adaptive schemes. Such schemes track the BER performance and adjust the complexity of the soft output sphere decoder by adaptively setting the related log-likelihood ratio (LLR) clipping value.',

	{'abstract': u'The aim of rendezvous in a graph is meeting of two mobile agents at some node of an unknown anonymous connected graph. In this paper, we focus on rendezvous in trees, and, analogously to the efforts that have been made for solving the exploration problem with compact automata, we study the size of memory of mobile agents that permits to solve the rendezvous problem deterministically. We assume that the agents are identical, and move in synchronous rounds. We first show that if the delay between the starting times of the agents is arbitrary, then the lower bound on memory required for rendezvous is Omega(log n) bits, even for the line of length n. This lower bound meets a previously known upper bound of O(log n) bits for rendezvous in arbitrary graphs of size at most n. Our main result is a proof that the amount of memory needed for rendezvous with simultaneous start depends essentially on the number L of leaves of the tree, and is exponentially less impacted by the number n of nodes. Indeed, we present two identical agents with O(log L + loglog n) bits of memory that solve the rendezvous problem in all trees with at most n nodes and at most L leaves. Hence, for the class of trees with polylogarithmically many leaves, there is an exponential gap in minimum memory size needed for rendezvous between the scenario with arbitrary delay and the scenario with delay zero. Moreover, we show that our upper bound is optimal by proving that Omega(log L + loglog n)',

Being able to perceive semantically meaningful objects in unstructured environments is a key capability in order to make robots suitable to perform high-level tasks in home environments. However, finding a solution for this task is daunting: it requires the ability to handle the variability in image formation in a moving camera with tight time constraints. The paper brings to attention some of the issues with applying three state of the art object recognition and detection methods in a mobile robotics scenario, and proposes methods to deal with windowing/segmentation. Thus, this work aims at evaluating the state-of-the-art in object perception in an attempt to develop a lightweight solution for mobile robotics use/research in typical indoor settings.',

Finally we input this per-packet power consumption in a mathematical model which estimates the lower and upper bounds of routings in the network.

	{'abstract': u'We propose a technique to design finite-length irregular low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes over the binary-input additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel with good performance in both the waterfall and the error floor region. The design process starts from a protograph which embodies a desirable degree distribution. This protograph is then lifted cyclically to a certain block length of interest. The lift is designed carefully to satisfy a certain approximate cycle extrinsic message degree (ACE) spectrum. The target ACE spectrum is one with extremal properties, implying a good error floor performance for the designed code. The proposed construction results in quasi-cyclic codes which are attractive in practice due to simple encoder and decoder implementation. Simulation results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed construction in comparison with similar existing constructions.',

	{'abstract': u'In this paper we propose a new design of LT codes, which decreases the amount of necessary overhead in comparison to existing designs. The design focuses on a parameter of the LT decoding process called the ripple size. This parameter was also a key element in the design proposed in the original work by Luby. Specifically, Luby argued that an LT code should provide a constant ripple size during decoding. In this work we show that the ripple size should decrease during decoding, in order to reduce the necessary overhead. Initially we motivate this claim by analytical results related to the redundancy within an LT code. We then propose a new design procedure, which can provide any desired achievable decreasing ripple size. The new design procedure is evaluated and compared to the current state of the art through simulations. This reveals a significant increase in performance with respect to both average overhead and error probability at any fixed overhead.',

	{'abstract': u'We consider spatially coupled code ensembles. A particular instance are convolutional LDPC ensembles. It was recently shown that, for transmission over the memoryless binary erasure channel, this coupling increases the belief propagation threshold of the ensemble to the maximum a-posteriori threshold of the underlying component ensemble. This paved the way for a new class of capacity achieving low-density parity check codes. It was also shown empirically that the same threshold saturation occurs when we consider transmission over general binary input memoryless channels. In this work, we report on empirical evidence which suggests that the same phenomenon also occurs when transmission takes place over a class of channels with memory. This is confirmed both by simulations as well as by computing EXIT curves.',

The screen objects have a wide variety of shapes; they can be either graphical objects or controls; there are solitary objects and very complex objects parts of which are involved in individual, synchronous, and related movements. Objects can be involved in forward movements and rotation; they can be resized and reconfigured; all these movements and situations are considered. On the basis of total movability, the new type of programs - user-driven applications - are designed. These applications continue to work according to their main purposes, but the whole control of WHAT, WHEN, and HOW must appear on the screen is passed from designers to users.',

	{'abstract': u"This paper analyzes the performances of the Spearman's rho (SR) and Kendall's tau (KT) with respect to samples drawn from bivariate normal and bivariate contaminated normal populations. The exact analytical formulae of the variance of SR and the covariance between SR and KT are obtained based on the Childs's reduction formula for the quadrivariate normal positive orthant probabilities. Close form expressions with respect to the expectations of SR and KT are established under the bivariate contaminated normal models. The bias, mean square error (MSE) and asymptotic relative efficiency (ARE) of the three estimators based on SR and KT to the Pearson's product moment correlation coefficient (PPMCC) are investigated in both the normal and contaminated normal models. Theoretical and simulation results suggest that, contrary to the opinion of equivalence between SR and KT in some literature, the behaviors of SR and KT are strikingly different in the aspects of bias effect, variance, mean square error, and asymptotic relative efficiency. The new findings revealed in this work provide not only deeper insights into the two most widely used rank based correlation coefficients, but also a guidance for choosing which one to use under the circumstances where the PPMCC fails to apply.",

We have today very efficient and reliable methods to encode, store and retrieve data in a storage medium that is fault tolerant against many types of failures. But does this guarantee -- or does it even seem likely -- that all knowledge can be preserved over thousands of years and beyond? History shows that many types of knowledge that were known before have been lost. We observe that the nature of stored and communicated information and the way it is interpreted is such that it always tends to decay and therefore must lost eventually in the long term. The likely fundamental conclusion is that knowledge cannot be reliably preserved indefinitely.',

	{'abstract': u'In this thesis, we introduce a new quantum Turing machine (QTM) model that supports general quantum operators, together with its pushdown, counter, and finite automaton variants, and examine the computational power of classical and quantum machines using small space bounds in many different cases. The main contributions are summarized below. Firstly, we consider QTMs in the unbounded error setting: (i) in some cases of sublogarithmic space bounds, the class of languages recognized by QTMs is shown to be strictly larger than that of classical ones; (ii) in constant space bounds, the same result can still be obtained for restricted QTMs; (iii) the complete characterization of the class of languages recognized by realtime constant space nondeterministic QTMs is given. Secondly, we consider constant space-bounded QTMs in the bounded error setting: (i) we introduce a new type of quantum and probabilistic finite automata (QFAs and PFAs, respectively,) with a special two-way input head which is not allowed to be stationary or move to the left but has the capability to reset itself to its starting position; (ii) the computational power of this type of quantum machine is shown to be superior to that of the probabilistic machine; (iii) based on these models, two-way PFAs and two-way classical-head QFAs are shown to be more succinct than two-way nondeterministic finite automata and their one-way variants; (iv) we also introduce PFAs and QFAs with postselection with their bounded error language classes, and give many characterizations of them. Thirdly, the computational power of realtime QFAs augmented with a write-only memory is investigated by showing many simulation results for different kinds of counter automata. Finally, some lower bounds of realtime classical Turing machines in order to recognize a nonregular language are shown to be tight.',

However, decision support benchmarks do not currently support XML features. In this paper, we introduce the XML Warehouse Benchmark (XWeB), which aims at filling this gap. XWeB derives from the relational decision support benchmark TPC-H.

	{'abstract': u'With the increasing demands for new data and real-time services, wireless networks should support calls with different traffic characteristics and different Quality of Service (QoS)guarantees. In addition, various wireless technologies and networks exist currently that can satisfy different needs and requirements of mobile users. Since these different wireless networks act as complementary to each other in terms of their capabilities and suitability for different applications, integration of these networks will enable the mobile users to be always connected to the best available access network depending on their requirements. This integration of heterogeneous networks will, however, lead to heterogeneities in access technologies and network protocols. To meet the requirements of mobile users under this heterogeneous environment, a common infrastructure to interconnect multiple access networks will be needed. In this chapter, the design issues of a number of mobility management schemes have been presented. Each of these schemes utilizes IP-based technologies to enable efficient roaming in heterogeneous network. Efficient handoff mechanisms are essential for ensuring seamless connectivity and uninterrupted service delivery. A number of handoff schemes in a heterogeneous networking environment are also presented in this chapter.',

	{'abstract': u'Building on ideas from online convex optimization, we propose a general framework for the design of efficient securities markets over very large outcome spaces. The challenge here is computational. In a complete market, in which one security is offered for each outcome, the market institution can not efficiently keep track of the transaction history or calculate security prices when the outcome space is large. The natural solution is to restrict the space of securities to be much smaller than the outcome space in such a way that securities can be priced efficiently. Recent research has focused on searching for spaces of securities that can be priced efficiently by existing mechanisms designed for complete markets. While there have been some successes, much of this research has led to hardness results. In this paper, we take a drastically different approach. We start with an arbitrary space of securities with bounded payoff, and establish a framework to design markets tailored to this space. We prove that any market satisfying a set of intuitive conditions must price securities via a convex potential function and that the space of reachable prices must be precisely the convex hull of the security payoffs. We then show how the convex potential function can be defined in terms of an optimization over the convex hull of the security payoffs. The optimal solution to the optimization problem gives the security prices. Using this framework, we provide an efficient market for predicting the landing location of an object on a sphere. In addition, we show that we can relax our "no-arbitrage" condition to design a new efficient market maker for pair betting, which is known to be #P-hard to price using existing mechanisms. This relaxation also allows the market maker to charge transaction fees so that the depth of the market can be dynamically increased as the number of trades increases.',

	{'abstract': u'We propose distributed algorithms to automatically deploy a team of mobile robots to partition and provide coverage of a non-convex environment. To handle arbitrary non-convex environments, we represent them as graphs. Our partitioning and coverage algorithm requires only short-range, unreliable pairwise "gossip" communication. The algorithm has two components: (1) a motion protocol to ensure that neighboring robots communicate at least sporadically, and (2) a pairwise partitioning rule to update territory ownership when two robots communicate. By studying an appropriate dynamical system on the space of partitions of the graph vertices, we prove that territory ownership converges to a pairwise-optimal partition in finite time. This new equilibrium set represents improved performance over common Lloyd-type algorithms. Additionally, we detail how our algorithm scales well for large teams in large environments and how the computation can run in anytime with limited resources. Finally, we report on large-scale simulations in complex environments and hardware experiments using the Player/Stage robot control system.',

	{'abstract': u'One of the most common types of functions in mathematics, physics, and engineering is a sum of products, sometimes called a partition function. After "normalization," a sum of products has a natural graphical representation, called a normal factor graph (NFG), in which vertices represent factors, edges represent internal variables, and half-edges represent the external variables of the partition function. In physics, so-called trace diagrams share similar features. We believe that the conceptual framework of representing sums of products as partition functions of NFGs is an important and intuitive paradigm that, surprisingly, does not seem to have been introduced explicitly in the previous factor graph literature. Of particular interest are NFG modifications that leave the partition function invariant. A simple subclass of such NFG modifications offers a unifying view of the Fourier transform, tree-based reparameterization, loop calculus, and the Legendre transform.',

An achievable rate region and an outer bound to the capacity region of a class of interference channels were obtained in previous work by Telatar and Tse as unions over all possible input distributions. In contrast to that previous work on the MIMO IC, a simple and an explicit achievable coding scheme are obtained here and shown to have the constant-gap-to-capacity property and in which the sub-rates of the common and private messages of each user are explicitly specified for each achievable rate pair. The constant-gap-to-capacity results are thus proved in this work by first establishing explicit upper and lower bounds to the capacity region. A reciprocity result is also proved which is that the capacity of the reciprocal MIMO IC is within a constant gap of the capacity region of the forward MIMO IC.',

	{'abstract': u"One of the most interesting scientific challenges nowadays deals with the analysis and the understanding of complex networks' dynamics and how their processes lead to emergence according to the interactions among their components. In this paper we approach the definition of new methodologies for the visualization and the exploration of the dynamics at play in real dynamic social networks. We present a recently introduced formalism called TVG (for time-varying graphs), which was initially developed to model and analyze highly-dynamic and infrastructure-less communication networks such as mobile ad-hoc networks, wireless sensor networks, or vehicular networks. We discuss its applicability to complex networks in general, and social networks in particular, by showing how it enables the specification and analysis of complex dynamic phenomena in terms of temporal interactions, and allows to easily switch the perspective between local and global dynamics. As an example, we chose the case of scientific communities by analyzing portion of the ArXiv repository (ten years of publications in physics) focusing on the social determinants (e.g. goals and potential interactions among individuals) behind the emergence and the resilience of scientific communities. We consider that scientific communities are at the same time communities of practice (through co-authorship) and that they exist also as representations in the scientists' mind, since references to other scientists' works is not merely an objective link to a relevant work, but it reveals social objects that one manipulates, select and refers to. In the paper we show the emergence/selection of a community as a goal-driven preferential attachment toward a set of authors among which there are some key scientists (Nobel prizes).",

	{'abstract': u'Peer-to-peer (P2P) locality has recently raised a lot of interest in the community. Indeed, whereas P2P content distribution enables financial savings for the content providers, it dramatically increases the traffic on inter-ISP links. To solve this issue, the idea to keep a fraction of the P2P traffic local to each ISP was introduced a few years ago. Since then, P2P solutions exploiting locality have been introduced. However, several fundamental issues on locality still need to be explored. In particular, how far can we push locality, and what is, at the scale of the Internet, the reduction of traffic that can be achieved with locality? In this paper, we perform extensive experiments on a controlled environment with up to 10,000 BitTorrent clients to evaluate the impact of high locality on inter-ISP links traffic and peers download completion time. We introduce two simple mechanisms that make high locality possible in challenging scenarios and we show that we save up to several orders of magnitude inter-ISP traffic compared to traditional locality without adversely impacting peers download completion time. In addition, we crawled 214,443 torrents representing 6,113,224 unique peers spread among 9,605 ASes. We show that whereas the torrents we crawled generated 11.6 petabytes of inter-ISP traffic, our locality policy implemented for all torrents could have reduced the global inter-ISP traffic by up to 40%.',

	{'abstract': u'In this paper we consider an interacting two-agent sequential decision-making problem consisting of a Markov source process, a causal encoder with feedback, and a causal decoder. Motivated by a desire to foster links between control and information theory, we augment the standard formulation by considering general alphabets and a cost function operating on current and previous symbols. Using dynamic programming, we provide a structural result whereby an optimal scheme exists that operates on appropriate sufficient statistics. We emphasize an example where the decoder alphabet lies in a space of beliefs on the source alphabet, and the additive cost function is a log likelihood ratio pertaining to sequential information gain. We also consider the inverse optimal control problem, where a fixed encoder/decoder pair satisfying statistical conditions is shown to be optimal for some cost function, using probabilistic matching. We provide examples of the applicability of this framework to communication with feedback, hidden Markov models and the nonlinear filter, decentralized control, brain-machine interfaces, and queuing theory.',

	{'abstract': u'Erasure correcting codes are widely used to ensure data persistence in distributed storage systems. This paper addresses the simultaneous repair of multiple failures in such codes. We go beyond existing work (i.e., regenerating codes by Dimakis et al.) by describing (i) coordinated regenerating codes (also known as cooperative regenerating codes) which support the simultaneous repair of multiple devices, and (ii) adaptive regenerating codes which allow adapting the parameters at each repair. Similarly to regenerating codes by Dimakis et al., these codes achieve the optimal tradeoff between storage and the repair bandwidth. Based on these extended regenerating codes, we study the impact of lazy repairs applied to regenerating codes and conclude that lazy repairs cannot reduce the costs in term of network bandwidth but allow reducing the disk-related costs (disk bandwidth and disk I/O).',

	{'abstract': u'We propose a new protocol solving the fundamental problem of disseminating a piece of information to all members of a group of n players. It builds upon the classical randomized rumor spreading protocol and several extensions. The main achievements are the following: Our protocol spreads the rumor to all other nodes in the asymptotically optimal time of (1 + o(1)) log_2 n. The whole process can be implemented in a way such that only O(n f(n)) calls are made, where f(n)= omega(1) can be arbitrary. In contrast to other protocols suggested in the literature, our algorithm only uses push operations, i.e., only informed nodes take active actions in the network. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first randomized push algorithm that achieves an asymptotically optimal running time.',

	{'abstract': u'We show that every universally truthful randomized mechanism for combinatorial auctions with submodular valuations that provides approximation to the social welfare and uses value queries only must use exponentially many value queries, where is the number of items. In contrast, ignoring incentives there exist constant ratio approximation algorithms for this problem. Our approach is based on a novel emph approach and completely skips the notoriously hard characterization step. The characterization step was the main obstacle for proving impossibility results in algorithmic mechanism design so far. We demonstrate two additional applications of our new technique: (1) an impossibility result for universally-truthful polynomial time flexible combinatorial public projects and (2) an impossibility result for truthful-in-expectation mechanisms for exact combinatorial public projects. The latter is the first result that bounds the power of polynomial-time truthful in expectation mechanisms in any setting.',

	{'abstract': u'Wireless mesh networks (WMNs) are evolving as a key technology for next-generation wireless networks showing raid progress and numerous applications. These networks have the potential to provide robust and high-throughput data delivery to wireless users. In a WMN, high speed routers equipped with advanced antennas, communicate with each other in a multi-hop fashion over wireless channels and form a broadband backhaul. However, the throughput of a WMN may be severely degraded due to presence of some selfish routers that avoid forwarding packets for other nodes even as they send their own traffic through the network. This paper presents an algorithm for detection of selfish nodes in a WMN. It uses statistical theory of inference for reliable clustering of the nodes and is based on local observations by the nodes. Simulation results show that the algorithm has a high detection rate while having a low rate of false positives.',

	{'abstract': u'Data warehouses are the core of decision support sys- tems, which nowadays are used by all kind of enter- prises in the entire world. Although many studies have been conducted on the need of decision support systems (DSSs) for small businesses, most of them adopt ex- isting solutions and approaches, which are appropriate for large-scaled enterprises, but are inadequate for small and middle-sized enterprises. Small enterprises require cheap, lightweight architec- tures and tools (hardware and software) providing on- line data analysis. In order to ensure these features, we review web-based business intelligence approaches. For real-time analysis, the traditional OLAP architecture is cumbersome and storage-costly; therefore, we also re- view in-memory processing. Consequently, this paper discusses the existing approa- ches and tools working in main memory and/or with web interfaces (including freeware tools), relevant for small and middle-sized enterprises in decision making.',

	{'abstract': u'In this paper we present a new method, which allows for the construction of triangular isosurfaces from three-dimensional data sets, such as 3D image data and/or numerical simulation data that are based on regularly shaped, cubic lattices. This novel volume-enclosing surface extraction technique, which has been named VESTA, can produce up to six different results due to the nature of the discretized 3D space under consideration. VESTA is neither template-based nor it is necessarily required to operate on 2x2x2 voxel cell neighborhoods only. The surface tiles are determined with a very fast and robust construction technique while potential ambiguities are detected and resolved. Here, we provide an in-depth comparison between VESTA and various versions of the well-known and very popular Marching Cubes algorithm for the very first time. In an application section, we demonstrate the extraction of VESTA isosurfaces for various data sets ranging from computer tomographic scan data to simulation data of relativistic hydrodynamic fireball expansions.',

	{'abstract': u'Although some information-theoretic measures of uncertainty or granularity have been proposed in rough set theory, these measures are only dependent on the underlying partition and the cardinality of the universe, independent of the lower and upper approximations. It seems somewhat unreasonable since the basic idea of rough set theory aims at describing vague concepts by the lower and upper approximations. In this paper, we thus define new information-theoretic entropy and co-entropy functions associated to the partition and the approximations to measure the uncertainty and granularity of an approximation space. After introducing the novel notions of entropy and co-entropy, we then examine their properties. In particular, we discuss the relationship of co-entropies between different universes. The theoretical development is accompanied by illustrative numerical examples.',

	{'abstract': u'The results of Strassen and Raz show that good enough tensor rank lower bounds have implications for algebraic circuit/formula lower bounds. We explore tensor rank lower and upper bounds, focusing on explicit tensors. For odd d, we construct field-independent explicit 0/1 tensors T:[n]^d-&gt;F with rank at least 2n^(floor(d/2))+n-Theta(d log n). This matches (over F_2) or improves (all other fields) known lower bounds for d=3 and improves (over any field) for odd d&gt;3. We also explore a generalization of permutation matrices, which we denote permutation tensors. We show, by counting, that there exists an order-3 permutation tensor with super-linear rank. We also explore a natural class of permutation tensors, which we call group tensors. For any group G, we define the group tensor T_G^d:G^d-&gt;F, by T_G^d(g_1,...,g_d)=1 iff g_1 x ... x g_d=1_G. We give two upper bounds for the rank of these tensors. The first uses representation theory and works over large fields F, showing (among other things) that rank_F(T_G^d)&lt;= |G|^(d/2). We also show that if this upper bound is tight, then super-linear tensor rank lower bounds would follow. The second upper bound uses interpolation and only works for abelian G, showing that over any field F that rank_F(T_G^d)&lt;= O(|G|^(1+log d)log^(d-1)|G|). In either case, this shows that many permutation tensors have far from maximal rank, which is very different from the matrix case and thus eliminates many natural candidates for high tensor rank. We also explore monotone tensor rank. We give explicit 0/1 tensors T:[n]^d-&gt;F that have tensor rank at most dn but have monotone tensor rank exactly n^(d-1). This is a nearly optimal separation.',

All hardware platforms use 802.15.4 compliant radios. Due to partial implementation of the standard, they do not communicate out of the box. A first contribution of our work is a careful description of the necessary steps to make such a heterogeneous network interoperate. Our software code is available online. We deploy a heterogeneous network testbed and conduct a thorough evaluation of the performance. We examine various network performance metrics (e.g., transmission rate, receiving rate, packet loss, etc.), and assess the capabilities of each device and their intercommunication. We used different setups (e.g., distance between transmitters and receivers, etc.) to better understand the network limitations for each hardware platform.',

	{'abstract': u'Ecommerce is an area where an Autonomic Computing system could be very effectively deployed. Ecommerce has created demand for high quality information technology services and businesses are seeking quality of service guarantees from their service providers. These guarantees are expressed as part of service level agreements. Properly adjusting tuning parameters for enforcement of the service level agreement is time-consuming and skills-intensive. Moreover, in case of changes to the workload, the setting of the parameters may no longer be optimum. In an ecommerce system, where the workload changes frequently, there is a need to update the parameters at regular intervals. This paper describes two approaches, one, using a proportional controller and two, using a fuzzy controller, to automate the tuning of MaxClients parameter of Apache web server based on the required response time and the current workload. This is an illustration of the self-optimizing characteristic of an autonomic computing system.',

	{'abstract': u'We consider the Gaussian interference channel with an intermediate relay as a main building block for cooperative interference networks. On the achievability side, we consider compress-and-forward based strategies. Specifically, a generalized compress-and-forward strategy, where the destinations jointly decode the compression indices and the source messages, is shown to improve upon the compress-and-forward strategy which sequentially decodes the compression indices and source messages, and the recently proposed generalized hash-and-forward strategy. We also construct a nested lattice code based compute-and-forward relaying scheme, which outperforms other relaying schemes when the direct link is weak. In this case, it is shown that, with a relay, the interference link can be useful for decoding the source messages. Noting the need for upperbounding the capacity for this channel, we propose a new technique with which the sum rate can be bounded. In particular, the sum capacity is upperbounded by considering the channel when the relay node has abundant power and is named potent for that reason. For the Gaussian interference relay channel with potent relay, we study the strong and the weak interference regimes and establish the sum capacity, which, in turn, serve as upperbounds for the sum capacity of the GIFRC with finite relay power. Numerical results demonstrate that upperbounds are tighter than the cut-set bound, and coincide with known achievable sum rates for many scenarios of interest. Additionally, the degrees of freedom of the GIFRC are shown to be 2 when the relay has large power, achievable using compress-and-forward.',

	{'abstract': u"The operating system's role in a computer system is to manage the various resources. One of these resources is the Central Processing Unit. It is managed by a component of the operating system called the CPU scheduler. Schedulers are optimized for typical workloads expected to run on the platform. However, a single scheduler may not be appropriate for all workloads. That is, a scheduler may schedule a workload such that the completion time is minimized, but when another type of workload is run on the platform, scheduling and therefore completion time will not be optimal; a different scheduling algorithm, or a different set of parameters, may work better. Several approaches to solving this problem have been proposed. The objective of this survey is to summarize the approaches based on data mining, which are available in the literature. In addition to solutions that can be directly utilized for solving this problem, we are interested in data mining research in related areas that have potential for use in operating system scheduling. We also explain general technical issues involved in scheduling in modern computers, including parallel scheduling issues related to multi-core CPUs. We propose a taxonomy that classifies the scheduling approaches we discuss into different categories.",

	{'abstract': u"Given a set of alternatives to be ranked, and some pairwise comparison data, ranking is a least squares computation on a graph. The vertices are the alternatives, and the edge values comprise the comparison data. The basic idea is very simple and old: come up with values on vertices such that their differences match the given edge data. Since an exact match will usually be impossible, one settles for matching in a least squares sense. This formulation was first described by Leake in 1976 for rankingfootball teams and appears as an example in Professor Gilbert Strang's classic linear algebra textbook. If one is willing to look into the residual a little further, then the problem really comes alive, as shown effectively by the remarkable recent paper of Jiang et al. With or without this twist, the humble least squares problem on graphs has far-reaching connections with many current areas ofresearch. These connections are to theoretical computer science (spectral graph theory, and multilevel methods for graph Laplacian systems); numerical analysis (algebraic multigrid, and finite element exterior calculus); other mathematics (Hodge decomposition, and random clique complexes); and applications (arbitrage, and ranking of sports teams). Not all of these connections are explored in this paper, but many are. The underlying ideas are easy to explain, requiring only the four fundamental subspaces from elementary linear algebra. One of our aims is to explain these basic ideas and connections, to get researchers in many fields interested in this topic. Another aim is to use our numerical experiments for guidance on selecting methods and exposing the need for further development.",

	{'abstract': u'We present a new data structure called the emph (CRAM) that can store a dynamic string of characters, e.g., representing the memory of a computer, in compressed form while achieving asymptotically almost-optimal bounds (in terms of empirical entropy) on the compression ratio. It allows short substrings of to be decompressed and retrieved efficiently and, significantly, characters at arbitrary positions of to be modified quickly during execution emph. This can be regarded as a new type of data compression that can update a compressed file directly. Moreover, at the cost of slightly increasing the time spent per operation, the CRAM can be extended to also support insertions and deletions. Our key observation that the empirical entropy of a string does not change much after a small change to the string, as well as our simple yet efficient method for maintaining an array of variable-length blocks under length modifications, may be useful for many other applications as well.',

	{'abstract': u'This paper considers a novel problem of how to choose an appropriate geometry for a group of agents with only shape constraints but with a flexible scale. Instead of assigning the formation system with a specific geometry, here the only requirement on the desired geometry is a shape without any location, rotation and, most importantly, scale constraints. Optimal rigid transformation between two different geometries is discussed with especial focus on the scaling operation, and the cooperative performance of the system is evaluated by what we call the geometries degrees of similarity (DOS) with respect to the desired shape during the entire convergence process. The design of the scale when measuring the DOS is discussed from constant value and time-varying function perspectives respectively. Fixed structured nonlinear control laws that are functions on the scale are developed to guarantee the exponential convergence of the system to the assigned shape. Our research is originated from a three-agent formation system and is further extended to multiple (n &gt; 3) agents by defining a triangular complement graph. Simulations demonstrate that formation system with the time-varying scale function outperforms the one with an arbitrary constant scale, and the relationship between underlying topology and the system performance is further discussed based on the simulation observations. Moveover, the control scheme is applied to bearing-only sensor-target localization to show its application potentials.',

	{'abstract': u'This paper proposes a new distance metric between clusterings that incorporates information about the spatial distribution of points and clusters. Our approach builds on the idea of a Hilbert space-based representation of clusters as a combination of the representations of their constituent points. We use this representation and the underlying metric to design a spatially-aware consensus clustering procedure. This consensus procedure is implemented via a novel reduction to Euclidean clustering, and is both simple and efficient. All of our results apply to both soft and hard clusterings. We accompany these algorithms with a detailed experimental evaluation that demonstrates the efficiency and quality of our techniques.',

	{'abstract': u'The paper considers gossip distributed estimation of a (static) distributed random field (a.k.a., large scale unknown parameter vector) observed by sparsely interconnected sensors, each of which only observes a small fraction of the field. We consider linear distributed estimators whose structure combines the information emph among sensors (the emph term resulting from the local gossiping exchange among sensors when they are able to communicate) and the information emph measured by the sensors (the emph or emph term.) This leads to mixed time scale algorithms--one time scale associated with the consensus and the other with the innovations. The paper establishes a distributed observability condition (global observability plus mean connectedness) under which the distributed estimates are consistent and asymptotically normal. We introduce the distributed notion equivalent to the (centralized) Fisher information rate, which is a bound on the mean square error reduction rate of any distributed estimator; we show that under the appropriate modeling and structural network communication conditions (gossip protocol) the distributed gossip estimator attains this distributed Fisher information rate, asymptotically achieving the performance of the optimal centralized estimator. Finally, we study the behavior of the distributed gossip estimator when the measurements fade (noise variance grows) with time; in particular, we consider the maximum rate at which the noise variance can grow and still the distributed estimator being consistent, by showing that, as long as the centralized estimator is consistent, the distributed estimator remains consistent.',

	{'abstract': u'An effective approach for energy conservation in wireless sensor networks is scheduling sleep intervals for extraneous nodes while the remaining nodes stay active to provide continuous service. For the sensor network to operate successfully the active nodes must maintain both sensing coverage and network connectivity, It proved before if the communication range of nodes is at least twice the sensing range, complete coverage of a convex area implies connectivity among the working set of nodes. In this paper we consider a rectangular region A = a *b, such that R a R b s s , , where s R is the sensing range of nodes. and put a constraint on minimum allowed distance between nodes(s). according to this constraint we present a new lower bound for communication range relative to sensing range of sensors(s 2 + 3 *R) that complete coverage of considered area implies connectivity among the working set of nodes; also we present a new distribution method, that satisfy our constraint.',

We present an algorithm, with complexity polynomial in log D on average (relative to the stable log-uniform measure), for counting the number of real roots of f. The best previous algorithms had complexity super-linear in D. We also discuss connections to sums of squares and A-discriminants, including explicit obstructions to expressing positive definite sparse polynomials as sums of squares of few sparse polynomials. Our key tool is the introduction of efficiently computable chamber cones, bounding regions in coefficient space where the number of real roots of f can be computed easily.

We introduce the notion of sparsity regret bound, which is a deterministic online counterpart of recent risk bounds derived in the stochastic setting under a sparsity scenario. We prove such regret bounds for an online-learning algorithm called SeqSEW and based on exponential weighting and data-driven truncation. In a second part we apply a parameter-free version of this algorithm to the stochastic setting (regression model with random design). This yields risk bounds of the same flavor as in Dalalyan and Tsybakov (2011) but which solve two questions left open therein. In particular our risk bounds are adaptive (up to a logarithmic factor) to the unknown variance of the noise if the latter is Gaussian. We also address the regression model with fixed design.',

	{'abstract': u"Goedel's completeness theorem is concerned with provability, while Girard's theorem in ludics (as well as full completeness theorems in game semantics) are concerned with proofs. Our purpose is to look for a connection between these two disciplines. Following a previous work [3], we consider an extension of the original ludics with contraction and universal nondeterminism, which play dual roles, in order to capture a polarized fragment of linear logic and thus a constructive variant of classical propositional logic. We then prove a completeness theorem for proofs in this extended setting: for any behaviour (formula) A and any design (proof attempt) P, either P is a proof of A or there is a model M of the orthogonal of A which defeats P. Compared with proofs of full completeness in game semantics, ours exhibits a striking similarity with proofs of Goedel's completeness, in that it explicitly constructs a countermodel essentially using Koenig's lemma, proceeds by induction on formulas, and implies an analogue of Loewenheim-Skolem theorem.",

	{'abstract': u'We present a new class of exponential integrators for ordinary differential equations. They are locally exact, i.e., they preserve the linearization of the original system at every point. Their construction consists in modifying existing numerical schemes in order to make them locally exact. The resulting schemes preserve all fixed points and are A-stable. The most promising results concern the discrete gradient method (modified implicit midpoint rule) where we succeeded to preserve essential geometric properties and the final results have a relatively simple form. In the case of one-dimensional Hamiltonian systems numerical experiments show that our modifications can increase the accuracy by several orders of magnitude. The main result of this paper is the construction of energy-preserving locally exact discrete gradient schemes for arbitrary multidimensional Hamiltonian systems in canonical coordinates.',

	{'abstract': u"We study the communication over Finite State Channels (FSCs), where the encoder and the decoder can control the availability or the quality of the noise-free feedback. Specifically, the instantaneous feedback is a function of an action taken by the encoder, an action taken by the decoder, and the channel output. Encoder and decoder actions take values in finite alphabets, and may be subject to average cost constraints. We prove capacity results for such a setting by constructing a sequence of achievable rates, using a simple scheme based on 'code tree' generation, that generates channel input symbols along with encoder and decoder actions. We prove that the limit of this sequence exists. For a given block length and probability of error, we give an upper bound on the maximum achievable rate. Our upper and lower bounds coincide and hence yield the capacity for the case where the probability of initial state is positive for all states. Further, for stationary indecomposable channels without intersymbol interference (ISI), the capacity is given as the limit of normalized directed information between the input and output sequence, maximized over an appropriate set of causally conditioned distributions. As an important special case, we consider the framework of 'to feed or not to feed back' where either the encoder or the decoder takes binary actions, which determine whether current channel output will be fed back to the encoder, with a constraint on the fraction of channel outputs that are fed back. As another special case of our framework, we characterize the capacity of 'coding on the backward link' in FSCs, i.e. when the decoder sends limited-rate instantaneous coded noise-free feedback on the backward link. Finally, we propose an extension of the Blahut-Arimoto algorithm for evaluating the capacity when actions can be cost constrained, and demonstrate its application on a few examples.",

	{'abstract': u'In the task cryptographers call bit commitment, one party encrypts a prediction in a way that cannot be decrypted until they supply a key, but has only one valid key. Bit commitment has many applications, and has been much studied, but completely and provably secure schemes have remained elusive. Here we report a new development in physics-based cryptography which gives a completely new way of implementing bit commitment that is perfectly secure. The technique involves sending a quantum state (for instance one or more photons) at light speed in one of two or more directions, either along a secure channel or by quantum teleportation. Its security proof relies on the no-cloning theorem of quantum theory and the no superluminal signalling principle of special relativity.',

	{'abstract': u'Much effort is spent everyday by programmers in trying to reduce long, failing execution traces to the cause of the error. We present a new algorithm for error cause localization based on a reduction to the maximal satisfiability problem (MAX-SAT), which asks what is the maximum number of clauses of a Boolean formula that can be simultaneously satisfied by an assignment. At an intuitive level, our algorithm takes as input a program and a failing test, and comprises the following three steps. First, using symbolic execution, we encode a trace of a program as a Boolean trace formula which is satisfiable iff the trace is feasible. Second, for a failing program execution (e.g., one that violates an assertion or a post-condition), we construct an unsatisfiable formula by taking the trace formula and additionally asserting that the input is the failing test and that the assertion condition does hold at the end. Third, using MAX-SAT, we find a maximal set of clauses in this formula that can be satisfied together, and output the complement set as a potential cause of the error. We have implemented our algorithm in a tool called bug-assist for C programs. We demonstrate the surprising effectiveness of the tool on a set of benchmark examples with injected faults, and show that in most cases, bug-assist can quickly and precisely isolate the exact few lines of code whose change eliminates the error. We also demonstrate how our algorithm can be modified to automatically suggest fixes for common classes of errors such as off-by-one.',

	{'abstract': u'When classical information is sent over a quantum channel, attaining the ultimate limit to channel capacity requires the receiver to make joint measurements over long codeword blocks. For a pure-state channel, we construct a receiver that can attain the ultimate capacity by applying a single-shot unitary transformation on the received quantum codeword followed by simultaneous (but separable) projective measurements on the single-modulation-symbol state spaces. We study the ultimate limits of photon-information-efficient communications on a lossy bosonic channel. Based on our general results for the pure-state quantum channel, we show some of the first concrete examples of codes and structured joint-detection optical receivers that can achieve fundamentally higher (superadditive) channel capacity than conventional receivers that detect each modulation symbol individually.',

	{'abstract': u'In this paper, we propose a new quality link metric, interference and bandwidth adjusted ETX (IBETX) for wireless multi-hop networks. As MAC layer affects the link performance and consequently the route quality, the metric therefore, tackles the issue by achieving twofold MAC-awareness. Firstly, interference is calculated using cross-layered approach by sending probes to MAC layer. Secondly, the nominal bit rate information is provided to all nodes in the same contention domain by considering the bandwidth sharing mechanism of 802.11. Like ETX, our metric also calculates link delivery ratios that directly affect throughput and selects those routes that bypass dense regions in the network. Simulation results by NS-2 show that IBETX gives 19% higher throughput than ETX and 10% higher than Expected Throughput (ETP). Our metric also succeeds to reduce average end-to-end delay up to 16% less than Expected Link Performance (ELP) and 24% less than ETX.',

The resulting graph shows complex features, typical of many real networked systems studied in literature. We develop a diffusion algorithm and apply it to the tennis contact network in order to rank professional players. Jimmy Connors is identified as the best player of the history of tennis according to our ranking procedure. We perform a complete analysis by determining the best players on specific playing surfaces as well as the best ones in each of the years covered by the data set. The results of our technique are compared to those of two other well established methods. In general, we observe that our ranking method performs better: it has a higher predictive power and does not require the arbitrary introduction of external criteria for the correct assessment of the quality of players. The present work provides a novel evidence of the utility of tools and methods of network theory in real applications.',

One must therefore find a balance between these too simple maintenance policies. To achieve this aim, we model the system by a stochastic hybrid process.

	{'abstract': u'An importance weight quantifies the relative importance of one example over another, coming up in applications of boosting, asymmetric classification costs, reductions, and active learning. The standard approach for dealing with importance weights in gradient descent is via multiplication of the gradient. We first demonstrate the problems of this approach when importance weights are large, and argue in favor of more sophisticated ways for dealing with them. We then develop an approach which enjoys an invariance property: that updating twice with importance weight is equivalent to updating once with importance weight . For many important losses this has a closed form update which satisfies standard regret guarantees when all examples have . We also briefly discuss two other reasonable approaches for handling large importance weights. Empirically, these approaches yield substantially superior prediction with similar computational performance while reducing the sensitivity of the algorithm to the exact setting of the learning rate. We apply these to online active learning yielding an extraordinarily fast active learning algorithm that works even in the presence of adversarial noise.',

	{'abstract': u"Convex support, the mean values of a set of random variables, is central in information theory and statistics. Equally central in quantum information theory are mean values of a set of observables in a finite-dimensional C*-algebra A, which we call (quantum) convex support. The convex support can be viewed as a projection of the state space of A and it is a projection of a spectrahedron. Spectrahedra are increasingly investigated at least since the 1990's boom in semidefinite programming. We recall the geometry of the positive semi-definite cone and of the state space. We write a convex duality for general self-dual convex cones. This restricts to projections of state spaces and connects them to results on spectrahedra. Really new in this article is an analysis of the face lattice of convex support by mapping this lattice to a lattice of orthogonal projections, using natural isomorphisms.

	{'abstract': u'We consider the problem of decentralized power allocation for competitive rate-maximization in a frequency-selective Gaussian interference channel under bounded channel uncertainty. We formulate a distribution-free robust framework for the rate-maximization game. We present the robust-optimization equilibrium for this game and derive sufficient conditions for its existence and uniqueness. We show that an iterative waterfilling algorithm converges to this equilibrium under certain sufficient conditions. We analyse the social properties of the equilibrium under varying channel uncertainty bounds for the two-user case. We also observe an interesting phenomenon that the equilibrium moves towards a frequency-division multiple access solution for any set of channel coefficients under increasing channel uncertainty bounds. We further prove that increasing channel uncertainty can lead to a more efficient equilibrium, and hence, a better sum rate in certain two-user communication systems. Finally, we confirm, through simulations, this improvement in equilibrium efficiency is also observed in systems with a higher number of users.',

	{'abstract': u"The objective of this paper is to present a Mixed Reality System (MRS) for rehabilitation of the upper limb after stroke. The system answers the following challenges: (i) increase motivation of patients by making the training a personalized experience; (ii) take into account patients' impairments by offering intuitive and easy to use interaction modalities; (iii) make it possible to therapists to track patient's activities and to evaluate/track their progress; (iv) open opportunities for telemedicine and tele rehabilitation; (v) and provide an economically acceptable system by reducing both equipment and management costs. In order to test this system a pilot study has been conducted in conjunction with a French hospital in order to understand the potential and benefits of mixed reality. The pilot involved 3 therapists who 'played the role' of patients. Three sessions, one using conventional rehabilitation, another using an ad hoc developed game on a PC, and another using a mixed reality version of the same game were held. Results have shown the MRS and the PC game to be accepted more than physical rehabilitation.",

	{'abstract': u'The Helly number of a family of sets with empty intersection is the size of its largest inclusion-wise minimal sub-family with empty intersection. Let F be a finite family of open subsets of an arbitrary locally arc-wise connected topological space Gamma. Assume that for every sub-family G of F the intersection of the elements of G has at most r connected components, each of which is a Q-homology cell. We show that the Helly number of F is at most r(d_Gamma+1), where d_Gamma is the smallest integer j such that every open set of Gamma has trivial Q-homology in dimension j and higher. (In particular d_ = d). This bound is best possible. We prove, in fact, a stronger theorem where small sub-families may have more than r connected components, each possibly with nontrivial homology in low dimension. As an application, we obtain several explicit bounds on Helly numbers in geometric transversal theory for which only ad hoc geometric proofs were previously known; in certain cases, the bound we obtain is better than what was previously known.',

	{'abstract': u'In temporal networks, where nodes interact via sequences of temporary events, information or resources can only flow through paths that follow the time-ordering of events. Such temporal paths play a crucial role in dynamic processes. However, since networks have so far been usually considered static or quasi-static, the properties of temporal paths are not yet well understood. Building on a definition and algorithmic implementation of the average temporal distance between nodes, we study temporal paths in empirical networks of human communication and air transport. Although temporal distances correlate with static graph distances, there is a large spread, and nodes that appear close from the static network view may be connected via slow paths or not at all. Differences between static and temporal properties are further highlighted in studies of the temporal closeness centrality. In addition, correlations and heterogeneities in the underlying event sequences affect temporal path lengths, increasing temporal distances in communication networks and decreasing them in the air transport network.',

	{'abstract': u'Zipf\'s power-law distribution is a generic empirical statistical regularity found in many complex systems. However, rather than universality with a single power-law exponent (equal to 1 for Zipf\'s law), there are many reported deviations that remain unexplained. A recently developed theory finds that the interplay between (i) one of the most universal ingredients, namely stochastic proportional growth, and (ii) birth and death processes, leads to a generic power-law distribution with an exponent that depends on the characteristics of each ingredient. Here, we report the first complete empirical test of the theory and its application, based on the empirical analysis of the dynamics of market shares in the product market. We estimate directly the average growth rate of market shares and its standard deviation, the birth rates and the "death" (hazard) rate of products. We find that temporal variations and product differences of the observed power-law exponents can be fully captured by the theory with no adjustable parameters. Our results can be generalized to many systems for which the statistical properties revealed by power law exponents are directly linked to the underlying generating mechanism.',

	{'abstract': u"Recent years have witnessed the explosion of online social networks (OSNs). They provide powerful IT-innovations for online social activities such as organizing contacts, publishing contents, and sharing interests between friends who may never meet before. As more and more people become the active users of online social networks, one may ponder questions such as: (1) Do OSNs indeed improve our sociability? (2) To what extent can we expand our offline social spectrum in OSNs? (3) Can we identify some interesting user behaviors in OSNs? Our work in this paper just aims to answer these interesting questions. To this end, we pay a revisit to the well-known Dunbar's number in online social networks. Our main research contributions are as follows. First, to our best knowledge, our work is the first one that systematically validates the existence of the online Dunbar's number in the range of [200,300]. To reach this, we combine using local-structure analysis and user-interaction analysis for extensive real-world OSNs. Second, we divide OSNs users into two categories: rational and aggressive, and find that rational users intend to develop close and reciprocated relationships, whereas aggressive users have no consistent behaviors. Third, we build a simple model to capture the constraints of time and cognition that affect the evolution of online social networks. Finally, we show the potential use of our findings in viral marketing and privacy management in online social networks.",

Furthermore, by considering the MG as a statistical sample of the FSMG, we compute approximated values of the key variable 2/N in the symmetric phase for different versions of the MG. As another application we prove that our results can be easily modified in order to handle certain kind of initial biased strategies scores, in particular when the bias is introduced at the agents' level. We also show that the FSMG verifies a strict period two dynamics (i.e., period two dynamics satisfied with probability 1) giving, to the best of our knowledge, the first example of an instance of the MG for which this feature can be analytically proved. Thanks to this property, it is possible to compute in a simple way the probability that a general instance of the MG breaks the period two dynamics for the first time in a given simulation.",

	{'abstract': u"Since it is impossible to predict and identify all the vulnerabilities of a network beforehand, and penetration into a system by malicious intruders cannot always be prevented, intrusion detection systems (IDSs) are essential entities to ensure the security of a networked system. To be effective in carrying out their functions, the IDSs need to be accurate, adaptive, and extensible. Given these stringent requirements and the high level of vulnerabilities of the current days' networks, the design of an IDS has become a very challenging task. Although, an extensive research has been done on intrusion detection in a distributed environment, distributed IDSs suffer from a number of drawbacks e.g., high rates of false positives, low detection efficiency etc. In this paper, the design of a distributed IDS is proposed that consists of a group of autonomous and cooperating agents. In addition to its ability to detect attacks, the system is capable of identifying and isolating compromised nodes in the network thereby introducing fault-tolerance in its operations. The experiments conducted on the system have shown that it has a high detection efficiency and low false positives compared to some of the currently existing systems.",

	{'abstract': u'We study a discrete time self interacting random process on graphs, which we call Greedy Random Walk. The walker is located initially at some vertex. As time evolves, each vertex maintains the set of adjacent edges touching it that have not been crossed yet by the walker. At each step, the walker being at some vertex, picks an adjacent edge among the edges that have not traversed thus far according to some (deterministic or randomized) rule. If all the adjacent edges have already been traversed, then an adjacent edge is chosen uniformly at random. After picking an edge the walk jumps along it to the neighboring vertex. We show that the expected edge cover time of the greedy random walk is linear in the number of edges for certain natural families of graphs. Examples of such graphs include the complete graph, even degree expanders of logarithmic girth, and the hypercube graph. We also show that GRW is transient in for all .',

	{'abstract': u'Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have recently attracted a lot of interest in the research community due their wide range of applications. Due to distributed nature of these networks and their deployment in remote areas, these networks are vulnerable to numerous security threats that can adversely affect their proper functioning. This problem is more critical if the network is deployed for some mission-critical applications such as in a tactical battlefield. Random failure of nodes is also very likely in real-life deployment scenarios. Due to resource constraints in the sensor nodes, traditional security mechanisms with large overhead of computation and communication are infeasible in WSNs. Security in sensor networks is, therefore, a particularly challenging task. This paper discusses the current state of the art in security mechanisms for WSNs. Various types of attacks are discussed and their countermeasures presented. A brief discussion on the future direction of research in WSN security is also included.',

	{'abstract': u'The classical approach of solvability using group theory is well known and one original motivation is to solve polynomials by radicals. Radicals are square, cube, square root, cube root etc of the original coefficients for the polynomial. A polynomial is solvable by radicals if the permutation group is solvable. This is exact solvability via group theory. With modern computers, we might need to relax our definition of exact solvability and move towards practical solvability. We will address seismic imaging as an example of practical solvability by semigroup theory. The difference between semigroup and group is that the semigroup operators do not have to be invertible as in group operators. Using the metaphor of complex decomposition, we will decompose an operator into simple part and complex part. The simple part of the operator is solvable by numerical methods. The complex part of the operator is interpretable but not numerically solvable. It is sometimes called the evanescent energy in geophysics.',

We characterize the relationship between accessibility and the average number of walks required in order to visit all reachable nodes (the exploration time), conjecture that the maximum accessibility implies the minimal exploration time, and confirm the relationship between the accessibility values and the number of nodes visited after a basic time unit.

	{'abstract': u"We study the power of classical and quantum algorithms equipped with nonuniform advice, in the form of a coin whose bias encodes useful information. This question takes on particular importance in the quantum case, due to a surprising result that we prove: a quantum finite automaton with just two states can be sensitive to arbitrarily small changes in a coin's bias. This contrasts with classical probabilistic finite automata, whose sensitivity to changes in a coin's bias is bounded by a classic 1970 result of Hellman and Cover. Despite this finding, we are able to bound the power of advice coins for space-bounded classical and quantum computation. We define the classes BPPSPACE/coin and BQPSPACE/coin, of languages decidable by classical and quantum polynomial-space machines with advice coins. Our main theorem is that both classes coincide with PSPACE/poly. Proving this result turns out to require substantial machinery. We use an algorithm due to Neff for finding roots of polynomials in NC; a result from algebraic geometry that lower-bounds the separation of a polynomial's roots; and a result on fixed-points of superoperators due to Aaronson and Watrous, originally proved in the context of quantum computing with closed timelike curves.",

	{'abstract': u'Recently, network error correction coding (NEC) has been studied extensively. Several bounds in classical coding theory have been extended to network error correction coding, especially the Singleton bound. In this paper, following the research line using the extended global encoding kernels proposed in cite, the refined Singleton bound of NEC can be proved more explicitly. Moreover, we give a constructive proof of the attainability of this bound and indicate that the required field size for the existence of network maximum distance separable (MDS) codes can become smaller further. By this proof, an algorithm is proposed to construct general linear network error correction codes including the linear network error correction MDS codes. Finally, we study the error correction capability of random linear network error correction coding. Motivated partly by the performance analysis of random linear network coding cite, we evaluate the different failure probabilities defined in this paper in order to analyze the performance of random linear network error correction coding. Several upper bounds on these probabilities are obtained and they show that these probabilities will approach to zero as the size of the base field goes to infinity. Using these upper bounds, we slightly improve on the probability mass function of the minimum distance of random linear network error correction codes in cite, as well as the upper bound on the field size required for the existence of linear network error correction codes with degradation at most .',

	{'abstract': u"We initiate the study of markets for private data, though the lens of differential privacy. Although the purchase and sale of private data has already begun on a large scale, a theory of privacy as a commodity is missing. In this paper, we propose to build such a theory. Specifically, we consider a setting in which a data analyst wishes to buy information from a population from which he can estimate some statistic. The analyst wishes to obtain an accurate estimate cheaply. On the other hand, the owners of the private data experience some cost for their loss of privacy, and must be compensated for this loss. Agents are selfish, and wish to maximize their profit, so our goal is to design truthful mechanisms. Our main result is that such auctions can naturally be viewed and optimally solved as variants of multi-unit procurement auctions. Based on this result, we derive auctions for two natural settings which are optimal up to small constant factors: 1. In the setting in which the data analyst has a fixed accuracy goal, we show that an application of the classic Vickrey auction achieves the analyst's accuracy goal while minimizing his total payment. 2. In the setting in which the data analyst has a fixed budget, we give a mechanism which maximizes the accuracy of the resulting estimate while guaranteeing that the resulting sum payments do not exceed the analysts budget. In both cases, our comparison class is the set of envy-free mechanisms, which correspond to the natural class of fixed-price mechanisms in our setting. In both of these results, we ignore the privacy cost due to possible correlations between an individuals private data and his valuation for privacy itself. We then show that generically, no individually rational mechanism can compensate individuals for the privacy loss incurred due to their reported valuations for privacy.",

	{'abstract': u'Understanding the neural mechanisms responsible for human social interactions is difficult, since the brain activities of two or more individuals have to be examined simultaneously and correlated with the observed social patterns. We introduce the concept of hyper-brain network, a connectivity pattern representing at once the information flow among the cortical regions of a single brain as well as the relations among the areas of two distinct brains. Graph analysis of hyper-brain networks constructed from the EEG scanning of 26 couples of individuals playing the Iterated Prisoner\'s Dilemma reveals the possibility to predict non-cooperative interactions during the decision-making phase. The hyper-brain networks of two-defector couples have significantly less inter-brain links and overall higher modularity - i.e. the tendency to form two separate subgraphs - than couples playing cooperative or tit-for-tat strategies. The decision to defect can be "read" in advance by evaluating the changes of connectivity pattern in the hyper-brain network.',

	{'abstract': u'This paper addresses the question of automatic data extraction from the Wiktionary, which is a multilingual and multifunctional dictionary. Wiktionary is a collaborative project working on the same principles as the Wikipedia. The Wiktionary entry is a plain text from the text processing point of view. Wiktionary guidelines prescribe the entry layout and rules, which should be followed by editors of the dictionary. The presence of the structure of a Wiktionary article and formatting rules allows transforming the Wiktionary entry structure into tables and relations in a relational database schema, which is a part of a machine-readable dictionary (MRD). The paper describes how the flat text of the Wiktionary entry was extracted, converted, and stored in the specially designed relational database. The MRD contains the definitions, semantic relations, and translations extracted from the English and Russian Wiktionaries. The parser software is released under the open source license agreement (GPL), to facilitate its dissemination, modification and upgrades, to draw researchers and programmers into parsing other Wiktionaries, not only Russian and English.',

	{'abstract': u'Many methods have been developed for data clustering, such as k-means, expectation maximization and algorithms based on graph theory. In this latter case, graphs are generally constructed by taking into account the Euclidian distance as a similarity measure, and partitioned using spectral methods. However, these methods are not accurate when the clusters are not well separated. In addition, it is not possible to automatically determine the number of clusters. These limitations can be overcome by taking into account network community identification algorithms. In this work, we propose a methodology for data clustering based on complex networks theory. We compare different metrics for quantifying the similarity between objects and take into account three community finding techniques. This approach is applied to two real-world databases and to two sets of artificially generated data. By comparing our method with traditional clustering approaches, we verify that the proximity measures given by the Chebyshev and Manhattan distances are the most suitable metrics to quantify the similarity between objects. In addition, the community identification method based on the greedy optimization provides the smallest misclassification rates.',

	{'abstract': u'Mulmuley and Sohoni (GCT1 in SICOMP 2001, GCT2 in SICOMP 2008) proposed to view the permanent versus determinant problem as a specific orbit closure problem and to attack it by methods from geometric invariant and representation theory. We adopt these ideas towards the goal of showing lower bounds on the border rank of specific tensors, in particular for matrix multiplication. We thus study specific orbit closure problems for the group acting on the tensor product of complex finite dimensional vector spaces. Let . A key idea from GCT2 is that the irreducible -representations occurring in the coordinate ring of the -orbit closure of a stable tensor are exactly those having a nonzero invariant with respect to the stabilizer group of . However, we prove that by considering -representations, as suggested in GCT1-2, only trivial lower bounds on border rank can be shown. It is thus necessary to study -representations, which leads to geometric extension problems that are beyond the scope of the subgroup restriction problems emphasized in GCT1-2. We prove a very modest lower bound on the border rank of matrix multiplication tensors using -representations. This shows at least that the barrier for -representations can be overcome. To advance, we suggest the coarser approach to replace the semigroup of representations of a tensor by its moment polytope. We prove first results towards determining the moment polytopes of matrix multiplication and unit tensors.',

	{'abstract': u'Individual happiness is a fundamental societal metric. Normally measured through self-report, happiness has often been indirectly characterized and overshadowed by more readily quantifiable economic indicators such as gross domestic product. Here, we examine expressions made on the online, global microblog and social networking service Twitter, uncovering and explaining temporal variations in happiness and information levels over timescales ranging from hours to years. Our data set comprises over 46 billion words contained in nearly 4.6 billion expressions posted over a 33 month span by over 63 million unique users. In measuring happiness, we use a real-time, remote-sensing, non-invasive, text-based approach---a kind of hedonometer. In building our metric, made available with this paper, we conducted a survey to obtain happiness evaluations of over 10,000 individual words, representing a tenfold size improvement over similar existing word sets. Rather than being ad hoc, our word list is chosen solely by frequency of usage and we show how a highly robust metric can be constructed and defended.',

	{'abstract': u'Recently, robust transmit beamforming has drawn considerable attention because it can provide guaranteed receiver performance in the presence of channel state information (CSI) errors. Assuming complex Gaussian distributed CSI errors, this paper investigates the robust beamforming design problem that minimizes the transmission power subject to probabilistic signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) constraints. The probabilistic SINR constraints in general have no closed-form expression and are difficult to handle. Based on a Bernstein-type inequality of complex Gaussian random variables, we propose a conservative formulation to the robust beamforming design problem. The semidefinite relaxation technique can be applied to efficiently handle the proposed conservative formulation. Simulation results show that, in comparison with the existing methods, the proposed method is more power efficient and is able to support higher target SINR values for receivers.',

	{'abstract': u'Working together in groups may be beneficial if compared to isolated efforts. Yet this is true only if all group members contribute to the success. If not, group efforts may act detrimentally on the fitness of their members. Here we study the evolution of cooperation in public goods games on scale-free networks that are subject to deletion of links that are connected to the highest-degree individuals, i.e., on networks that are under attack. We focus on the case where all groups a player belongs to are considered for the determination of payoffs; the so-called multi-group public goods games. We find that the effect of link deletions on the evolution of cooperation is predominantly detrimental, although there exist regions of the multiplication factor where the existence of an "optimal" number of removed links for deterioration of cooperation can also be demonstrated. The findings are explained by means of wealth distributions and analytical approximations, confirming that socially diverse states are crucial for the successful evolution of cooperation.',

In the scenario of Swap Bribery, each voter assigns a certain price for swapping the positions of two consecutive candidates in his preference ranking. The question is whether it is possible, without exceeding a given budget, to bribe the voters in a way that the preferred candidate wins in the election. We initiate a parameterized and multivariate complexity analysis of Swap Bribery, focusing on the case of k-approval. We investigate how different cost functions affect the computational complexity of the problem. We identify a special case of k-approval for which the problem can be solved in polynomial time, whereas we prove NP-hardness for a slightly more general scenario. We obtain fixed-parameter tractability as well as W[1]-hardness results for certain natural parameters.',

	{'abstract': u"In social systems, people communicate with each other and form groups based on their interests. The pattern of interactions, the network, and the ideas that flow on the network naturally evolve together. Researchers use simple models to capture the feedback between changing network patterns and ideas on the network, but little is understood about the role of past events in the feedback process. Here we introduce a simple agent-based model to study the coupling between peoples' ideas and social networks, and better understand the role of history in dynamic social networks. We measure how information about ideas can be recovered from information about network structure and, the other way around, how information about network structure can be recovered from information about ideas. We find that it is in general easier to recover ideas from the network structure than vice versa.",

	{'abstract': u'Suppose we have n keys, n access probabilities for the keys, and n+1 access probabilities for the gaps between the keys. Let h_min(n) be the minimal height of a binary search tree for n keys. We consider the problem to construct an optimal binary search tree with near minimal height, i.e. with height h &lt;= h_min(n) + Delta for some fixed Delta. It is shown, that for any fixed Delta optimal binary search trees with near minimal height can be constructed in time O(n^2). This is as fast as in the unrestricted case. So far, the best known algorithms for the construction of height-restricted optimal binary search trees have running time O(L n^2), whereby L is the maximal permitted height. Compared to these algorithms our algorithm is at least faster by a factor of log n, because L is lower bounded by log n.',

	{'abstract': u'In this paper, we present optimization approaches for Access Point (AP) location and frequency assignment, two major planning tasks in deploying Wi-Fi networks. Since APs are relatively cheap, the major concern is network performance. We consider a performance metric, referred to as access efficiency, that captures key aspects of how user devices share access to the wireless medium. We propose a two-step approach to deal with AP location and frequency assignment in maximizing access efficiency. A novelty of our modeling approach is to estimate, in the first step of AP location, the impact of expected frequency availability on frequency assignment. For each of the two steps we derive hyperbolic formulations and their linearizations, and we propose a promising enumerative formulation. Sample results are reported to show the applicability of the approach.',

	{'abstract': u"The problem of optimal mass transport arises in numerous applications including image registration, mesh generation, reflector design, and astrophysics. One approach to solving this problem is via the Monge-Amp `ere equation. While recent years have seen much work in the development of numerical methods for solving this equation, very little has been done on the implementation of the transport boundary condition. In this paper, we propose a method for solving the transport problem by iteratively solving a Monge-Amp `ere equation with Neumann boundary conditions. To enable mappings between variable densities, we extend an earlier discretization of the equation to allow for right-hand sides that depend on gradients of the solution [Froese and Oberman, SIAM J. Numer. Anal., 49 (2011) 1692--1714]. This discretization provably converges to the viscosity solution. The resulting system is solved efficiently with Newton's method. We provide several challenging computational examples that demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency ( time) of the proposed method.",

	{'abstract': u'Stationary reciprocal processes defined on a finite interval of the integer line can be seen as a special class of Markov random fields restricted to one dimension. Non stationary reciprocal processes have been extensively studied in the past especially by Jamison, Krener, Levy and co-workers. The specialization of the non-stationary theory to the stationary case, however, does not seem to have been pursued in sufficient depth in the literature. Stationary reciprocal processes (and reciprocal stochastic models) are potentially useful for describing signals which naturally live in a finite region of the time (or space) line. Estimation or identification of these models starting from observed data seems still to be an open problem which can lead to many interesting applications in signal and image processing. In this paper, we discuss a class of reciprocal processes which is the acausal analog of auto-regressive (AR) processes, familiar in control and signal processing. We show that maximum likelihood identification of these processes leads to a covariance extension problem for block-circulant covariance matrices. This generalizes the famous covariance band extension problem for stationary processes on the integer line. As in the usual stationary setting on the integer line, the covariance extension problem turns out to be a basic conceptual and practical step in solving the identification problem. We show that the maximum entropy principle leads to a complete solution of the problem.',

	{'abstract': u"Suppose we would like to know all answers to a set of statistical queries C on a data set up to small error, but we can only access the data itself using statistical queries. A trivial solution is to exhaustively ask all queries in C. Can we do any better? + We show that the number of statistical queries necessary and sufficient for this task is---up to polynomial factors---equal to the agnostic learning complexity of C in Kearns' statistical query (SQ) model. This gives a complete answer to the question when running time is not a concern. + We then show that the problem can be solved efficiently (allowing arbitrary error on a small fraction of queries) whenever the answers to C can be described by a submodular function. This includes many natural concept classes, such as graph cuts and Boolean disjunctions and conjunctions. While interesting from a learning theoretic point of view, our main applications are in privacy-preserving data analysis: Here, our second result leads to the first algorithm that efficiently releases differentially private answers to of all Boolean conjunctions with 1% average error. This presents significant progress on a key open problem in privacy-preserving data analysis. Our first result on the other hand gives unconditional lower bounds on any differentially private algorithm that admits a (potentially non-privacy-preserving) implementation using only statistical queries. Not only our algorithms, but also most known private algorithms can be implemented using only statistical queries, and hence are constrained by these lower bounds. Our result therefore isolates the complexity of agnostic learning in the SQ-model as a new barrier in the design of differentially private algorithms.",

	{'abstract': u'External information propagates in the cell mainly through signaling cascades and transcriptional activation, allowing it to react to a wide spectrum of environmental changes. High throughput experiments identify numerous molecular components of such cascades that may, however, interact through unknown partners. Some of them may be detected using data coming from the integration of a protein-protein interaction network and mRNA expression profiles. This inference problem can be mapped onto the problem of finding appropriate optimal connected subgraphs of a network defined by these datasets. The optimization procedure turns out to be computationally intractable in general. Here we present a new distributed algorithm for this task, inspired from statistical physics, and apply this scheme to alpha factor and drug perturbations data in yeast. We identify the role of the COS8 protein, a member of a gene family of previously unknown function, and validate the results by genetic experiments. The algorithm we present is specially suited for very large datasets, can run in parallel, and can be adapted to other problems in systems biology. On renowned benchmarks it outperforms other algorithms in the field.',

	{'abstract': u"In this study we analyze one year of anonymized telecommunications data for over one million customers from a large European cellphone operator, and we investigate the relationship between people's calls and their physical location. We discover that more than 90% of users who have called each other have also shared the same space (cell tower), even if they live far apart. Moreover, we find that close to 70% of users who call each other frequently (at least once per month on average) have shared the same space at the same time - an instance that we call co-location. Co-locations appear indicative of coordination calls, which occur just before face-to-face meetings. Their number is highly predictable based on the amount of calls between two users and the distance between their home locations - suggesting a new way to quantify the interplay between telecommunications and face-to-face interactions.",

	{'abstract': u'We study the adversarial satisfiability problem, where the adversary can choose whether variables are negated in clauses or not in order to make the resulting formula unsatisfiable. This is one case of a general class of adversarial optimization problems that often arise in practice and are algorithmically much harder than the standard optimization problems. We use the cavity method to compute large deviations of the entropy in the random satisfiability problem with respect to the negation-configurations. We conclude that in the thermodynamic limit the best strategy the adversary can adopt is extremely close to simply balancing the number of times every variable is and is not negated. We also conduct a numerical study of the problem, and find that there are very strong pre-asymptotic effects that are due to the fact that for small sizes exponential and factorial growth is hardly distinguishable.',

	{'abstract': u"We consider the cryptographic problem of constructing an invertible random permutation from a public random function (i.e., which can be accessed by the adversary). This goal is formalized by the notion of indifferentiability of Maurer et al. (TCC 2004). This is the natural extension to the public setting of the well-studied problem of building random permutations from random functions, which was first solved by Luby and Rackoff (Siam J. Comput., '88) using the so-called Feistel construction. The most important implication of such a construction is the equivalence of the random oracle model (Bellare and Rogaway, CCS '93) and the ideal cipher model, which is typically used in the analysis of several constructions in symmetric cryptography. Coron et al. (CRYPTO 2008) gave a rather involved proof that the six-round Feistel construction with independent random round functions is indifferentiable from an invertible random permutation. Also, it is known that fewer than six rounds do not suffice for indifferentiability. The first contribution (and starting point) of our paper is a concrete distinguishing attack which shows that the indifferentiability proof of Coron et al. is not correct. In addition, we provide supporting evidence that an indifferentiability proof for the six-round Feistel construction may be very hard to find. To overcome this gap, our main contribution is a proof that the Feistel construction with eigthteen rounds is indifferentiable from an invertible random permutation. The approach of our proof relies on assigning to each of the rounds in the construction a unique and specific role needed in the proof. This avoids many of the problems that appear in the six-round case.",

	{'abstract': u'A typical approach in estimating the learning rate of a regularized learning scheme is to bound the approximation error by the sum of the sampling error, the hypothesis error and the regularization error. Using a reproducing kernel space that satisfies the linear representer theorem brings the advantage of discarding the hypothesis error from the sum automatically. Following this direction, we illustrate how reproducing kernel Banach spaces with the l1 norm can be applied to improve the learning rate estimate of l1-regularization in machine learning.',

	{'abstract': u'A technique introduced by Indyk and Woodruff [STOC 2005] has inspired several recent advances in data-stream algorithms. We show that a number of these results follow easily from the application of a single probabilistic method called Precision Sampling. Using this method, we obtain simple data-stream algorithms that maintain a randomized sketch of an input vector , which is useful for the following applications. 1) Estimating the -moment of , for . 2) Estimating the -norm of , for , with small update time. 3) Estimating cascaded norms for all . 4) sampling, where the goal is to produce an element with probability (approximately) . It extends to similarly defined -sampling, for . For all these applications the algorithm is essentially the same: scale the vector x entry-wise by a well-chosen random vector, and run a heavy-hitter estimation algorithm on the resulting vector. Our sketch is a linear function of x, thereby allowing general updates to the vector x. Precision Sampling itself addresses the problem of estimating a sum from weak estimates of each real . More precisely, the estimator first chooses a desired precision for each , and then it receives an estimate of every within additive . Its goal is to provide a good approximation to while keeping a tab on the "approximation cost" . Here we refine previous work [Andoni, Krauthgamer, and Onak, FOCS 2010] which shows that as long as , a good multiplicative approximation can be achieved using total precision of only .',

	{'abstract': u"We study a fingerprinting game in which the number of colluders and the collusion channel are unknown. The encoder embeds fingerprints into a host sequence and provides the decoder with the capability to trace back pirated copies to the colluders. Fingerprinting capacity has recently been derived as the limit value of a sequence of maximin games with mutual information as their payoff functions. However, these games generally do not admit saddle-point solutions and are very hard to solve numerically. Here under the so-called Boneh-Shaw marking assumption, we reformulate the capacity as the value of a single two-person zero-sum game, and show that it is achieved by a saddle-point solution. If the maximal coalition size is k and the fingerprinting alphabet is binary, we show that capacity decays quadratically with k. Furthermore, we prove rigorously that the asymptotic capacity is 1/(k^2 2ln2) and we confirm our earlier conjecture that Tardos' choice of the arcsine distribution asymptotically maximizes the mutual information payoff function while the interleaving attack minimizes it. Along with the asymptotic behavior, numerical solutions to the game for small k are also presented.",

For the strong interference case, the capacity region is established for the discrete memoryless channel; for the Gaussian case, we attain a line segment on the boundary of the capacity region. Moreover, the capacity region for the Gaussian channel is identified for the case when one interference link being strong, and the other being very strong. For a subclass of Gaussian channels with mixed interference, a boundary point of the capacity region is determined.

	{'abstract': u"When people play a repeated game they usually try to anticipate their opponents' moves based on past observations, and then decide what action to take next. Behavioural economics studies the mechanisms by which strategic decisions are taken in these adaptive learning processes. We here investigate a model of learning the iterated prisoner's dilemma game. Players have the choice between three strategies, always defect (ALLD), always cooperate (ALLC) and tit-for-tat (TFT). The only strict Nash equilibrium in this situation is ALLD. When players learn to play this game convergence to the equilibrium is not guaranteed, for example we find cooperative behaviour if players discount observations in the distant past. When agents use small samples of observed moves to estimate their opponent's strategy the learning process is stochastic, and sustained oscillations between cooperation and defection can emerge. These cycles are similar to those found in stochastic evolutionary processes, but the origin of the noise sustaining the oscillations is different and lies in the imperfect sampling of the opponent's strategy. Based on a systematic expansion technique, we are able to predict the properties of these learning cycles, providing an analytical tool with which the outcome of more general stochastic adaptation processes can be characterised.",

The objective of the BMP is to place a set of probe sequences in the array and find an embedding (deposition of nucleotides/residues to the array cells) such that the sum of border length is minimized. A variant of the problem, called P-BMP, is that the placement is given and the concern is simply to find the embedding. Approximation algorithms have been previously proposed for the problem but it is unknown whether the problem is NP-hard or not. In this paper, we give a thorough study of different variations of BMP by giving NP-hardness proofs and improved approximation algorithms. We show that P-BMP, 1D-BMP, and BMP are all NP-hard. Contrast with the previous result that 1D-P-BMP is polynomial time solvable, the interesting implications include (i) the array dimension (1D or 2D) differentiates the complexity of P-BMP; (ii) for 1D array, whether placement is given differentiates the complexity of BMP; (iii) BMP is NP-hard regardless of the dimension of the array. Another contribution of the paper is improving the approximation for BMP from to , where is the total number of sequences.',

We prove that quantum computers that are augmented with WOM can solve problems that neither a classical computer with WOM nor a quantum computer without WOM can solve, when all other resource bounds are equal. We focus on realtime quantum finite automata, and examine the increase in their power effected by the addition of WOMs with different access modes and capacities. Some problems that are unsolvable by two-way probabilistic Turing machines using sublogarithmic amounts of read/write memory are shown to be solvable by these enhanced automata.',

	{'abstract': u"We investigate the complexity of short symbolic sequences of chaotic dynamical systems by using lossless compression algorithms.

[arXiv:cond-mat/0204134, 2002]) which was subsequently shown to be optimal. NSPRS has also been used to estimate Entropy of written English (P. Grassberger [arXiv:physics/0207023, 2002]). We propose a new measure of complexity - defined as the number of iterations of NSRPS required to transform the input sequence into a constant sequence. We test this measure on symbolic sequences of the Logistic map for various values of the bifurcation parameter. The proposed measure of complexity is easy to compute and is observed to be highly correlated with the Lyapunov exponent of the original non-linear time series, even for very short symbolic sequences (as short as 50 samples). Finally, we construct symbolic sequences from the Skew-Tent map which are incompressible by popular compression algorithms like WinZip, WinRAR and 7-Zip, but compressible by NSRPS.",

Our implementation is available in C++ with Matlab binding, using CUDA to utilise the graphics processing unit (GPU). Limited speed ups are possible due to the bandwidth bound nature of the problem. Furthermore, a complex dependency pattern must be obeyed, requiring multiple kernels to be launched. Nonetheless, this makes for an interesting problem, and our approach can reduce the computation time by a factor of around 7 for matrices of size 5000 by 5000 and k=16, in comparison with the LINPACK suite running on a CPU of comparable vintage. Much larger problems can be handled however due to the O(n) scaling in required GPU memory of our method.',

	{'abstract': u'We study the underlying mathematical properties of various partial order models of concurrency based on transition systems, Petri nets, and event structures, and show that the concurrent behaviour of these systems can be captured in a uniform way by two simple and general dualities of local behaviour. Such dualities are used to define new mu-calculi and logic games for the analysis of concurrent systems with partial order semantics. Some results of this work are: the definition of a number of mu-calculi which, in some classes of systems, induce the same identifications as some of the best known bisimulation equivalences for concurrency; and the definition of (infinite) higher-order logic games for bisimulation and model-checking, where the players of the games are given (local) monadic second-order power on the sets of elements they are allowed to play. More specifically, we show that our games are sound and complete, and therefore, determined; moreover, they are decidable in the finite case and underpin novel decision procedures for bisimulation and model-checking. Since these mu-calculi and logic games generalise well-known fixpoint logics and game-theoretic decision procedures for concurrent systems with interleaving semantics, the results herein give some of the groundwork for the design of a logic-based, game-theoretic framework for studying, in a uniform way, several concurrent systems regardless of whether they have an interleaving or a partial order semantics.',

	{'abstract': u'One of the classic results in scheduling theory is the 2-approximation algorithm by Lenstra, Shmoys, and Tardos for the problem of scheduling jobs to minimize makespan on unrelated machines, i.e., job j requires time p_ if processed on machine i. More than two decades after its introduction it is still the algorithm of choice even in the restricted model where processing times are of the form p_ in . This problem, also known as the restricted assignment problem, is NP-hard to approximate within a factor less than 1.5 which is also the best known lower bound for the general version. Our main result is a polynomial time algorithm that estimates the optimal makespan of the restricted assignment problem within a factor 33/17 + epsilon approx 1.9412 + epsilon, where epsilon &gt; 0 is an arbitrarily small constant. The result is obtained by upper bounding the integrality gap of a certain strong linear program, known as configuration LP, that was previously successfully used for the related Santa Claus problem. Similar to the strongest analysis for that problem our proof is based on a local search algorithm that will eventually find a schedule of the mentioned approximation guarantee, but is not known to converge in polynomial time.',

	{'abstract': u'We theoretically study semi-supervised clustering in sparse graphs in the presence of pairwise constraints on the cluster assignments of nodes. We focus on bi-cluster graphs, and study the impact of semi-supervision for varying constraint density and overlap between the clusters. Recent results for unsupervised clustering in sparse graphs indicate that there is a critical ratio of within-cluster and between-cluster connectivities below which clusters cannot be recovered with better than random accuracy. The goal of this paper is to examine the impact of pairwise constraints on the clustering accuracy. Our results suggests that the addition of constraints does not provide automatic improvement over the unsupervised case. When the density of the constraints is sufficiently small, their only impact is to shift the detection threshold while preserving the criticality. Conversely, if the density of (hard) constraints is above the percolation threshold, the criticality is suppressed and the detection threshold disappears.',

	{'abstract': u'In this paper we initiate the study of optimization of bandit type problems in scenarios where the feedback of a play is not immediately known. This arises naturally in allocation problems which have been studied extensively in the literature, albeit in the absence of delays in the feedback. We study this problem in the Bayesian setting. In presence of delays, no solution with provable guarantees is known to exist with sub-exponential running time. We show that bandit problems with delayed feedback that arise in allocation settings can be forced to have significant structure, with a slight loss in optimality. This structure gives us the ability to reason about the relationship of single arm policies to the entangled optimum policy, and eventually leads to a O(1) approximation for a significantly general class of priors. The structural insights we develop are of key interest and carry over to the setting where the feedback of an action is available instantaneously, and we improve all previous results in this setting as well.',

	{'abstract': u"Engineered systems are designed to deftly operate under predetermined conditions yet are notoriously fragile when unexpected perturbations arise. In contrast, biological systems operate in a highly flexible manner; learn quickly adequate responses to novel conditions, and evolve new routines/traits to remain competitive under persistent environmental change. A recent theory on the origins of biological flexibility has proposed that degeneracy - the existence of multi-functional components with partially overlapping functions - is a primary determinant of the robustness and adaptability found in evolved systems. While degeneracy's contribution to biological flexibility is well documented, there has been little investigation of degeneracy design principles for achieving flexibility in systems engineering. Actually, the conditions that can lead to degeneracy are routinely eliminated in engineering design. With the planning of transportation vehicle fleets taken as a case study, this paper reports evidence that degeneracy improves robustness and adaptability of a simulated fleet without incurring costs to efficiency. We find degeneracy dramatically increases robustness of a fleet to unpredicted changes in the environment while it also facilitates robustness to anticipated variations. When we allow a fleet's architecture to be adapted in response to environmental change, we find degeneracy can be selectively acquired, leading to faster rates of design adaptation and ultimately to better designs. Given the range of conditions where favorable short-term and long-term performance outcomes are observed, we propose that degeneracy design principles fundamentally alter the propensity for adaptation and may be useful within several engineering and planning contexts.",

	{'abstract': u'In comparative genomics, a transposition is an operation that exchanges two consecutive sequences of genes in a genome. The transposition distance, that is, the minimum number of transpositions needed to transform a genome into another, is, according to numerous studies, a relevant evolutionary distance. The problem of computing this distance when genomes are represented by permutations, called the Sorting by Transpositions problem, has been introduced by Bafna and Pevzner in 1995. It has naturally been the focus of a number of studies, but the computational complexity of this problem has remained undetermined for 15 years. In this paper, we answer this long-standing open question by proving that the Sorting by Transpositions problem is NP-hard. As a corollary of our result, we also prove that the following problem is NP-hard: given a permutation pi, is it possible to sort pi using db(pi)/3 permutations, where db(pi) is the number of breakpoints of pi?',

	{'abstract': u'The subject of this work is the patrolling of an environment with the aid of a team of autonomous agents. We consider both the design of open-loop trajectories with optimal properties, and of distributed control laws converging to optimal trajectories. As performance criteria, the refresh time and the latency are considered, i.e., respectively, time gap between any two visits of the same region, and the time necessary to inform every agent about an event occurred in the environment. We associate a graph with the environment, and we study separately the case of a chain, tree, and cyclic graph. For the case of chain graph, we first describe a minimum refresh time and latency team trajectory, and we propose a polynomial time algorithm for its computation. Then, we describe a distributed procedure that steers the robots toward an optimal trajectory. For the case of tree graph, a polynomial time algorithm is developed for the minimum refresh time problem, under the technical assumption of a constant number of robots involved in the patrolling task. Finally, we show that the design of a minimum refresh time trajectory for a cyclic graph is NP-hard, and we develop a constant factor approximation algorithm.',

	{'abstract': u"In considering the college admissions problem, almost fifty years ago, Gale and Shapley came up with a simple abstraction based on preferences of students and colleges. They introduced the concept of stability and optimality; and proposed the deferred acceptance (DA) algorithm that is proven to lead to a stable and optimal solution. This algorithm is simple and computationally efficient. Furthermore, in subsequent studies it is shown that the DA algorithm is also strategy-proof, which means, when the algorithm is played out as a mechanism for matching two sides (e.g. colleges and students), the parties (colleges or students) have no incentives to act other than according to their true preferences. Yet, in practical college admission systems, the DA algorithm is often not adopted. Instead, an algorithm known as the Boston Mechanism (BM) or its variants are widely adopted. In BM, colleges accept students without deferral (considering other colleges' decisions), which is exactly the opposite of Gale-Shapley's DA algorithm. To explain and rationalize this reality, we introduce the notion of reciprocating preference to capture the influence of a student's interest on a college's decision. This model is inspired by the actual mechanism used to match students to universities in Hong Kong. The notion of reciprocating preference defines a class of matching algorithms, allowing different degrees of reciprocating preferences by the students and colleges. DA and BM are but two extreme cases (with zero and a hundred percent reciprocation) of this set. This model extends the notion of stability and optimality as well. As in Gale-Shapley's original paper, we discuss how the analogy can be carried over to the stable marriage problem, thus demonstrating the model's general applicability.",

	{'abstract': u'Approximation algorithms for classical constraint satisfaction problems are one of the main research areas in theoretical computer science. Here we define a natural approximation version of the QMA-complete local Hamiltonian problem and initiate its study. We present two main results. The first shows that a non-trivial approximation ratio can be obtained in the class NP using product states. The second result (which builds on the first one), gives a polynomial time (classical) algorithm providing a similar approximation ratio for dense instances of the problem. The latter result is based on an adaptation of the "exhaustive sampling method" by Arora et al. [J. Comp. Sys. Sci. 58, p.193 (1999)] to the quantum setting, and might be of independent interest.',

	{'abstract': u"Individuals interact with conspecifics in a number of behavioural contexts or dimensions. Here, we formalise this by considering a social network between n individuals interacting in b behavioural dimensions as a nxnxb multidimensional object. In addition, we propose that the topology of this object is driven by individual needs to reduce uncertainty about the outcomes of interactions in one or more dimension. The proposal grounds social network dynamics and evolution in individual selection processes and allows us to define the uncertainty of the social network as the joint entropy of its constituent interaction networks. In support of these propositions we use simulations and natural 'knock-outs' in a free-ranging baboon troop to show (i) that such an object can display a small-world state and (ii) that, as predicted, changes in interactions after social perturbations lead to a more certain social network, in which the outcomes of interactions are easier for members to predict. This new formalisation of social networks provides a framework within which to predict network dynamics and evolution under the assumption that it is driven by individuals seeking to reduce the uncertainty of their social environment.",

The models have a multiplicative structure and in certain cases possess scale invariance properties. Using detailed population data in metropolitan US regions validates the demand model. The trip length distribution, evaluated under destination choice models of the intervening opportunities type, has quasi-analytic form.We take advantage of this feature to study the sensitivity of the trip length distribution to parameters of the demand, supply and destination choice models. We find that trip length is affected in important but different ways by the spatial density of potential destinations, the dependence among their attractiveness levels, and the correlation between supply and demand at different spatial scales.',

	{'abstract': u'Anisotropic decompositions using representation systems such as curvelets, contourlet, or shearlets have recently attracted significantly increased attention due to the fact that they were shown to provide optimally sparse approximations of functions exhibiting singularities on lower dimensional embedded manifolds. The literature now contains various direct proofs of this fact and of related sparse approximation results. However, it seems quite cumbersome to prove such a canon of results for each system separately, while many of the systems exhibit certain similarities. In this paper, with the introduction of the concept of sparsity equivalence, we aim to provide a framework which allows categorization of the ability for sparse approximations of representation systems. This framework, in particular, enables transferring results on sparse approximations from one system to another. We demonstrate this concept for the example of curvelets and shearlets, and discuss how this viewpoint immediately leads to novel results for both systems.',

A statistical formulation is given where we propose to use data contamination to model and understand the phenomenon of image mis-registration. This model is widely applicable to many other types of errors as well, for example, measurement errors and gross errors etc. The impact of data contamination on classification is studied under a statistical learning theoretical framework. A closed-form asymptotic bound is established for the resulting loss in classification accuracy, which is less than for data contamination of an amount of . Our bound is sharper than similar bounds in the domain adaptation literature and, unlike such bounds, it applies to classifiers with an infinite Vapnik-Chervonekis (VC) dimension. Extensive simulations have been conducted on both synthetic and real datasets under various types of data contamination, including label flipping, feature swapping and the replacement of feature values with data generated from a random source such as a Gaussian or Cauchy distribution. Our simulation results show that the bound we derive is fairly tight.',

	{'abstract': u'We study the optimal usage-based pricing problem in a resource-constrained network with one profit-maximizing service provider and multiple groups of surplus-maximizing users. With the assumption that the service provider knows the utility function of each user (thus complete information), we find that the complete price differentiation scheme can achieve a large revenue gain (e.g., 50%) compared to no price differentiation, when the total network resource is comparably limited and the high willingness to pay users are minorities. However, the complete price differentiation scheme may lead to a high implementational complexity. To trade off the revenue against the implementational complexity, we further study the partial price differentiation scheme, and design a polynomial-time algorithm that can compute the optimal partial differentiation prices. We also consider the incomplete information case where the service provider does not know which group each user belongs to. We show that it is still possible to realize price differentiation under this scenario, and provide the sufficient and necessary condition under which an incentive compatible differentiation scheme can achieve the same revenue as under complete information.',

Our goal is to present a definite figure about the characteristics of spam and spammers. Since spammers change their mode of operation to counter anti spam technology,continues evaluation of the characteristics of spam and spammers technology has become mandatory. These evaluations help us to enhance the existing technology to combat spam effectively. We collected 400 thousand spam mails from a spam trap set up in a corporate mail server for a period of 14 months form January 2006 to February 2007. Spammers use common techniques to spam end users regardless of corporate server and public mail server. So we believe that our spam collection is a sample of world wide spam traffic. Studying the characteristics of this sample helps us to better understand the features of spam and spammers technology. We believe that this analysis could be useful to develop more efficient anti spam techniques.',

	{'abstract': u"In social tagging systems, also known as folksonomies, users collaboratively manage tags to annotate resources. Naturally, social tagging systems can be modeled as a tripartite hypergraph, where there are three different types of nodes, namely users, resources and tags, and each hyperedge has three end nodes, connecting a user, a resource and a tag that the user employs to annotate the resource. Then, how can we automatically detect user, resource and tag communities from the tripartite hypergraph? In this paper, by turning the problem into a problem of finding an efficient compression of the hypergraph's structure, we propose a quality function for measuring the goodness of partitions of a tripartite hypergraph into communities. Later, we develop a fast community detection algorithm based on minimizing the quality function. We explain advantages of our method and validate it by comparing with various state of the art techniques in a set of synthetic datasets.",

We prove that none of these combinations can be effectively interpolated without the use of quantifiers, even if the input formulae are quantifier-free. We go on to identify fragments of QPA+UP and QPA+UF with restricted forms of guarded quantification that are closed under interpolation. Formulae in these fragments can easily be mapped to quantifier-free expressions with integer division. For QPA+AR, we formulate a sound interpolation procedure that potentially produces interpolants with unrestricted quantifiers.',

	{'abstract': u'The problem of identifying the 3D pose of a known object from a given 2D image has important applications in Computer Vision ranging from robotic vision to image analysis. Our proposed method of registering a 3D model of a known object on a given 2D photo of the object has numerous advantages over existing methods: It does neither require prior training nor learning, nor knowledge of the camera parameters, nor explicit point correspondences or matching features between image and model. Unlike techniques that estimate a partial 3D pose (as in an overhead view of traffic or machine parts on a conveyor belt), our method estimates the complete 3D pose of the object, and works on a single static image from a given view, and under varying and unknown lighting conditions. For this purpose we derive a novel illumination-invariant distance measure between 2D photo and projected 3D model, which is then minimised to find the best pose parameters. Results for vehicle pose detection are presented.',

	{'abstract': u'Finite-volume numerical method for study shallow water flows over an arbitrary bed profile in the presence of external force is proposed. This method uses the quasi-two-layer model of hydrodynamic flows over a stepwise boundary with advanced consideration of the flow features near the step. A distinctive feature of the suggested model is a separation of a studied flow into two layers in calculating flow quantities near each step, and improving by this means approximation of depth-averaged solutions of the initial three-dimensional Euler equations. We are solving the shallow-water equations for one layer, introducing the fictitious lower layer only as an auxiliary structure in setting up the appropriate Riemann problems for the upper layer. Besides quasi-two-layer approach leads to appearance of additional terms in one-layer finite-difference representation of balance equations. These terms provide the mechanical work made by nonhomogeneous bed interacting with flow. A notable advantage of the proposed method is the consideration of the properties of the process of the waterfall, namely the fluid flow on the step in which the fluid does not wet part of the vertical wall of the step. The presence of dry zones in the vertical part of the step indicates violation of the conditions of hydrostatic flow. The quasi-two-layer approach determines the size of the dry zone of the vertical component of the step. Consequently it gives an opportunity to figure out the amount of flow kinetic energy dissipation on complex boundary. Numerical simulations are performed based on the proposed algorithm of various physical phenomena, such as a breakdown of the rectangular fluid column over an inclined plane, large-scale motion of fluid in the gravity field in the presence of Coriolis force over an mounted obstacle on underlying surface.',

	{'abstract': u'The combined trace (i.e., comtrace) notion was introduced by Janicki and Koutny in 1995 as a generalization of the Mazurkiewicz trace notion. Comtraces are congruence classes of step sequences, where the congruence relation is defined from two relations simultaneity and serializability on events. They also showed that comtraces correspond to some class of labeled stratified order structures, but left open the question of what class of labeled stratified orders represents comtraces. In this work, we proposed a class of labeled stratified order structures that captures exactly the comtrace notion. Our main technical contributions are representation theorems showing that comtrace quotient monoid, combined dependency graph (Kleijn and Koutny 2008) and our labeled stratified order structure characterization are three different and yet equivalent ways to represent comtraces.

	{'abstract': u'Data from high-energy physics (HEP) experiments are collected with significant financial and human effort and are in many cases unique. At the same time, HEP has no coherent strategy for data preservation and re-use, and many important and complex data sets are simply lost. In a period of a few years, several important and unique experimental programs will come to an end, including those at HERA, the b-factories and at the Tevatron. An inter-experimental study group on HEP data preservation and long-term analysis (DPHEP) was formed and a series of workshops were held to investigate this issue in a systematic way. The physics case for data preservation and the preservation models established by the group are presented, as well as a description of the transverse global projects and strategies already in place.',

	{'abstract': u'In this paper the effects of external links on the synchronization performance of community networks, especially on the competition between individual community and the whole network, are studied in detail. The study is organized from two aspects: the number or portion of external links and the connecting strategy of external links between different communities. It is found that increasing the number of external links will enhance the global synchronizability but degrade the ynchronization performance of individual community before some critical point. After that the individual community will synchronize better and better as part of the whole network because the community structure is not so prominent. Among various connection strategies, connecting nodes belonging to different communities randomly rather than connecting nodes with larger degrees is the most efficient way to enhance global synchronization of the network. However, a preferential connection scheme linking most of the hubs from the communities will allow rather efficient global synchronization while maintaining strong dynamical clustering of the communities. Interestingly, the observations are found to be relevant in a realistic network of cat cortex. The synchronization state is just at the critical point, which shows a reasonable combination of segregated function in individual communities and coordination among them. Our work sheds light on principles underlying the emergence of modular architectures in real network systems and provides guidance for the manipulation of synchronization in community networks.',

The voting of independent voters is based on their fundamental values; on the other hand, the voting of herders is based on the number of votes. Herders always select the majority of the previous votes, which is visible to them. We call them digital herders. We can accurately calculate the distribution of votes for special cases. When r&gt;=3, we find that a phase transition occurs at the upper limit of t, where t is the discrete time (or number of votes). As the fraction of herders increases, the model features a phase transition beyond which a state where most voters make the correct choice coexists with one where most of them are wrong. On the other hand, when r&lt;3, there is no phase transition. In this case, the herders' performance is the same as that of the independent voters.

For an increasing monotone graph property we say that a base graph is emph with respect to if for every subgraph such that for every the graph possesses . This notion naturally extends the idea of the emph of graphs recently initiated by Sudakov and Vu. In this paper we study the -resilience of a typical graph from with respect to the Hamiltonicity property where we let range over all values for which the base graph is expected to be Hamiltonian. In particular, we prove that for every and if a graph is sampled from then with high probability removing from each vertex of "small" degree all incident edges but two and from any other vertex at most a -fraction of the incident edges will result in a Hamiltonian graph. Considering this generalized approach to the notion of resilience allows to establish several corollaries which improve on the best known bounds of Hamiltonicity related questions. It implies that for every positive and large enough values of , if then with high probability the local resilience of with respect to being Hamiltonian is at least , improving on the previous bound for this range of . Another implication is a result on optimal packing of edge disjoint Hamilton cycles in a random graph. We prove that if then with high probability a graph sampled from contains edge disjoint Hamilton cycles, extending the previous range of for which this was known to hold.',

	{'abstract': u'The task of verifying the compatibility between interacting web services has traditionally been limited to checking the compatibility of the interaction protocol in terms of message sequences and the type of data being exchanged. Since web services are developed largely in an uncoordinated way, different services often use independently developed ontologies for the same domain instead of adhering to a single ontology as standard. In this work we investigate the approaches that can be taken by the server to verify the possibility to reach a state with semantically inconsistent results during the execution of a protocol with a client, if the client ontology is published. Often database is used to store the actual data along with the ontologies instead of storing the actual data as a part of the ontology description. It is important to observe that at the current state of the database the semantic conflict state may not be reached even if the verification done by the server indicates the possibility of reaching a conflict state. A relational algebra based decision procedure is also developed to incorporate the current state of the client and the server databases in the overall verification procedure.',

	{'abstract': u'Enumerating all 3-manifold triangulations of a given size is a difficult but increasingly important problem in computational topology. A key difficulty for enumeration algorithms is that most combinatorial triangulations must be discarded because they do not represent topological 3-manifolds. In this paper we show how to preempt bad triangulations by detecting genus in partially-constructed vertex links, allowing us to prune the enumeration tree substantially. The key idea is to manipulate the boundary edges surrounding partial vertex links using expected logarithmic time operations. Practical testing shows the resulting enumeration algorithm to be significantly faster, with up to 249x speed-ups even for small problems where comparisons are feasible. We also discuss parallelisation, and describe new data sets that have been obtained using high-performance computing facilities.',

	{'abstract': u"A theorem on (partial) convergence to consensus of multiagent systems is presented. It is proven with tools studying the convergence properties of products of row stochastic matrices with positive diagonals which are infinite to the left. Thus, it can be seen as a switching linear system in discrete time. It is further shown that the result is strictly more general than results of Moreau (IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control, vol. 50, no. 2, 2005), although Moreau's results are formulated for generally nonlinear updating maps. This is shown by demonstrating the existence of an appropriate switching linear system which mimics the nonlinear updating maps. Further on, an example system is given for which convergence to consensus can be shown by using the theorem. In this system the lengths of intercommunication intervals in the switching communication topology grows without bound. This makes other theorems not applicable.",

	{'abstract': u'This paper details the application of a genetic programming framework for classification of decision tree of Soil data to classify soil texture. The database contains measurements of soil profile data. We have applied GATree for generating classification decision tree. GATree is a decision tree builder that is based on Genetic Algorithms (GAs). The idea behind it is rather simple but powerful. Instead of using statistic metrics that are biased towards specific trees we use a more flexible, global metric of tree quality that try to optimize accuracy and size. GATree offers some unique features not to be found in any other tree inducers while at the same time it can produce better results for many difficult problems. Experimental results are presented which illustrate the performance of generating best decision tree for classifying soil texture for soil data set.',

	{'abstract': u'Human languages evolve continuously, and a puzzling problem is how to reconcile the apparent robustness of most of the deep linguistic structures we use with the evidence that they undergo possibly slow, yet ceaseless, changes. Is the state in which we observe languages today closer to what would be a dynamical attractor with statistically stationary properties or rather closer to a non-steady state slowly evolving in time? Here we address this question in the framework of the emergence of shared linguistic categories in a population of individuals interacting through language games. The observed emerging asymptotic categorization, which has been previously tested - with success - against experimental data from human languages, corresponds to a metastable state where global shifts are always possible but progressively more unlikely and the response properties depend on the age of the system. This aging mechanism exhibits striking quantitative analogies to what is observed in the statistical mechanics of glassy systems. We argue that this can be a general scenario in language dynamics where shared linguistic conventions would not emerge as attractors, but rather as metastable states.',

	{'abstract': u"Spam messages muddle up users inbox, consume network resources, and build up DDoS attacks, spread malware. Our goal is to present a definite figure about the characteristics of spam and spam vulnerable email accounts. These evaluations help us to enhance the existing technology to combat spam effectively. We collected 400 thousand spam mails from a spam trap set up in a corporate mail server for a period of 14 months form January 2006 to February 2007. Spammers use common techniques to spam end users regardless of corporate server and public mail server. So we believe that our spam collection is a sample of world wide spam traffic. Studying the characteristics of this sample helps us to better understand the features of spam and spam vulnerable e-mail accounts. We believe that this analysis is highly useful to develop more efficient anti spam techniques. In our analysis we classified spam based on attachment and contents. According to our study the four years old heavy users email accounts attract more spam than four years oldlight users mail accounts. The 14 months old relatively new email accounts don't receive spam. In some special cases like DDoS attacks, the new email accounts receive spam. During DDoS attack 14 months old heavy users email accounts have attracted more number of spam than 14 months old light users mail accounts.",

	{'abstract': u'Scientometric data is used to investigate empirically the emergence of search regimes in Biotechnology, Genomics, and Nanotechnology. Complex regimes can emerge when three independent sources of variance interact. In our model, researchers can be considered as the nodes that carry the science system. Research is geographically situated with site-specific skills, tacit knowledge and infrastructures. Second, the emergent science level refers to the formal communication of codified knowledge published in journals. Third, the socio-economic dynamics indicate the ways in which knowledge production relates to society. Although Biotechnology, Genomics, and Nanotechnology can all be characterised by rapid growth and divergent dynamics, the regimes differ in terms of self-organization among these three sources of variance. The scope of opportunities for researchers to contribute within the constraints of the existing body of knowledge are different in each field. Furthermore, the relevance of the context of application contributes to the knowledge dynamics to various degrees.',

In this paper we introduce CEDAR, the secure communication library used by the Condor High Throughput Computing software, and present the advantages to a distributed computing system resulting from CEDAR's separation of these layers. Regardless of the authentication method used, CEDAR establishes a secure session key, which has the flexibility to be used for multiple capabilities. We demonstrate how a layered approach to security sessions can avoid round-trips and latency inherent in network authentication. The creation of a distinct session management layer allows for optimizations to improve scalability by way of delegating sessions to other components in the system. This session delegation creates a chain of trust that reduces the overhead of establishing secure connections and enables centralized enforcement of system-wide security policies. Additionally, secure channels based upon UDP datagrams are often overlooked by existing libraries; we show how CEDAR's structure accommodates this as well. As an example of the utility of this work, we show how the use of delegated security sessions and other techniques inherent in CEDAR's architecture enables US CMS to meet their scalability requirements in deploying Condor over large-scale, wide-area grid systems.",

	{'abstract': u'We consider optimizing average queueing delay and average power consumption in a nonpreemptive multi-class M/G/1 queue with dynamic power control that affects instantaneous service rates. Four problems are studied: (1) satisfying per-class average delay constraints; (2) minimizing a separable convex function of average delays subject to per-class delay constraints; (3) minimizing average power consumption subject to per-class delay constraints; (4) minimizing a separable convex function of average delays subject to an average power constraint. Combining an achievable region approach in queueing systems and the Lyapunov optimization theory suitable for optimizing dynamic systems with time average constraints, we propose a unified framework to solve the above problems. The solutions are variants of dynamic rules, and implement weighted priority policies in every busy period, where weights are determined by past queueing delays in all job classes. Our solutions require limited statistical knowledge of arrivals and service times, and no statistical knowledge is needed in the first problem. Overall, we provide a new set of tools for stochastic optimization and control over multi-class queueing systems with time average constraints.',

	{'abstract': u'We consider two-player games played in real time on game structures with clocks where the objectives of players are described using parity conditions. The games are emph in that at each turn, both players independently propose a time delay and an action, and the action with the shorter delay is chosen. To prevent a player from winning by blocking time, we restrict each player to play strategies that ensure that the player cannot be responsible for causing a zeno run. First, we present an efficient reduction of these games to emph (i.e., not concurrent) emph (i.e., untimed) parity games. Our reduction improves the best known complexity for solving timed parity games. Moreover, the rich class of algorithms for classical parity games can now be applied to timed parity games. The states of the resulting game are based on clock regions of the original game, and the state space of the finite game is linear in the size of the region graph. Second, we consider two restricted classes of strategies for the player that represents the controller in a real-time synthesis problem, namely, emph and emph winning strategies. Using a limit-robust winning strategy, the controller cannot choose an exact real-valued time delay but must allow for some nonzero jitter in each of its actions. If there is a given lower bound on the jitter, then the strategy is bounded-robust winning. We show that exact strategies are more powerful than limit-robust strategies, which are more powerful than bounded-robust winning strategies for any bound. For both kinds of robust strategies, we present efficient reductions to standard timed automaton games. These reductions provide algorithms for the synthesis of robust real-time controllers.',

	{'abstract': u'One of the main characteristics of real-world networks is their large clustering. Clustering is one aspect of a more general but much less studied structural organization of networks, i.e. edge multiplicity, defined as the number of triangles in which edges, rather than vertices, participate. Here we show that the multiplicity distribution of real networks is in many cases scale-free, and in general very broad. Thus, besides the fact that in real networks the number of edges attached to vertices often has a scale-free distribution, we find that the number of triangles attached to edges can have a scale-free distribution as well. We show that current models, even when they generate clustered networks, systematically fail to reproduce the observed multiplicity distributions. We therefore propose a generalized model that can reproduce networks with arbitrary distributions of vertex degrees and edge multiplicities, and study many of its properties analytically.',

	{'abstract': u'Sequential prediction problems such as imitation learning, where future observations depend on previous predictions (actions), violate the common i.i.d. assumptions made in statistical learning. This leads to poor performance in theory and often in practice. Some recent approaches provide stronger guarantees in this setting, but remain somewhat unsatisfactory as they train either non-stationary or stochastic policies and require a large number of iterations. In this paper, we propose a new iterative algorithm, which trains a stationary deterministic policy, that can be seen as a no regret algorithm in an online learning setting. We show that any such no regret algorithm, combined with additional reduction assumptions, must find a policy with good performance under the distribution of observations it induces in such sequential settings. We demonstrate that this new approach outperforms previous approaches on two challenging imitation learning problems and a benchmark sequence labeling problem.',

	{'abstract': u'Given an ensemble of autonomous agents and a task to achieve cooperatively, how much do the agents need to know about the state of the ensemble and about the task in order to achieve it? We introduce new methods to understand these aspects of decentralized control. Precisely, we introduce a framework to capture what agents with partial information can achieve by cooperating and illustrate its use by deriving results about global stabilization of directed formations. This framework underscores the need to differentiate the knowledge an agent has about the task to accomplish from the knowledge an agent has about the current state of the system. The control of directed formations has proven to be more difficult than initially thought, as is exemplified by the lack of global result for formations with n geq 4 agents. We established in part I that the space of planar formations has a non-trivial global topology. We propose here an extension of the notion of global stability which, because it acknowledges this non-trivial topology, can be applied to the study of formation control. We then develop a framework that reduces the question of whether feedback with partial information can stabilize the system to whether two sets of functions intersect. We apply this framework to the study of a directed formation with n = 4 agents and show that the agents do not have enough information to implement locally stabilizing feedback laws. Additionally, we show that feedback laws that respect the information flow cannot stabilize a target configuration without stabilizing other, unwanted configurations.',

	{'abstract': u'Background: Dermoscopy is one of the major imaging modalities used in the diagnosis of melanoma and other pigmented skin lesions. Due to the difficulty and subjectivity of human interpretation, computerized analysis of dermoscopy images has become an important research area. One of the most important steps in dermoscopy image analysis is the automated detection of lesion borders. Methods: In this article, we present a systematic overview of the recent border detection methods in the literature paying particular attention to computational issues and evaluation aspects. Conclusion: Common problems with the existing approaches include the acquisition, size, and diagnostic distribution of the test image set, the evaluation of the results, and the inadequate description of the employed methods. Border determination by dermatologists appears to depend upon higher-level knowledge, therefore it is likely that the incorporation of domain knowledge in automated methods will enable them to perform better, especially in sets of images with a variety of diagnoses.',

	{'abstract': u'In this paper, we develop new methods for the analysis of decentralized control systems and we apply them to formation control problems. The basic set-up consists of a system with multiple agents corresponding to the nodes of a graph whose edges encode the information that is available to the agents. We address the question of whether the information flow defined by the graph is sufficient for the agents to accomplish a given task. Formation control is concerned with problems in which agents are required to stabilize at a given distance from other agents. In this context, the graph of a formation encodes both the information flow and the distance constraints, by fixing the lengths of the edges. A formation is said to be rigid if it cannot be continuously deformed with the distance constraints satisfied; a formation is minimally rigid if no distance constraint can be omitted without the formation losing its rigidity. Hence, the graph underlying minimally rigid formation provides just enough constraints to yield a rigid formation. An open question we will settle is whether the information flow afforded by a minimally rigid graph is sufficient to insure global stability. We show that the answer is negative in the case of directed information flow. In this first part, we establish basic properties of formation control in the plane. Formations and the associated control problems are defined modulo rigid transformations. This fact has strong implications on the geometry of the space of formations and on the feedback laws, since they need to respect this invariance. We study both aspects here. We show that the space of frameworks of n agents is CP(n-2) x (0, infty). We then illustrate how the non-trivial topology of this space relates to the parametrization of the formation by inter-agent distances.',

The game ends as soon as at least one player chooses to quit. The players then receive a payoff, which depends on the set of players that did choose to quit. If the game never ends, the payoff to each player is zero. For analysis of quitting games the so called one-step games are used. Important properties of the expected payoff and of equilibria in one-step games are stated. Furthermore some relations between equilibria in one-step games and equilibria in quitting games are considered.

LDs affect about 10 percent of all children enrolled in schools. The problems of children with specific learning disabilities have been a cause of concern to parents and teachers for some time. Decision trees and clustering are powerful and popular tools used for classification and prediction in Data mining. Different rules extracted from the decision tree are used for prediction of learning disabilities. Clustering is the assignment of a set of observations into subsets, called clusters, which are useful in finding the different signs and symptoms (attributes) present in the LD affected child. In this paper, J48 algorithm is used for constructing the decision tree and K-means algorithm is used for creating the clusters. By applying these classification techniques, LD in any child can be identified.',

	{'abstract': u'This paper constructs translation invariant operators on L2(R^d), which are Lipschitz continuous to the action of diffeomorphisms. A scattering propagator is a path ordered product of non-linear and non-commuting operators, each of which computes the modulus of a wavelet transform. A local integration defines a windowed scattering transform, which is proved to be Lipschitz continuous to the action of diffeomorphisms. As the window size increases, it converges to a wavelet scattering transform which is translation invariant. Scattering coefficients also provide representations of stationary processes. Expected values depend upon high order moments and can discriminate processes having the same power spectrum. Scattering operators are extended on L2 (G), where G is a compact Lie group, and are invariant under the action of G. Combining a scattering on L2(R^d) and on Ld (SO(d)) defines a translation and rotation invariant scattering on L2(R^d).',

	{'abstract': u"Many software developments projects fail due to quality problems. Software testing enables the creation of high quality software products. Since it is a cumbersome and expensive task, and often hard to manage, both its technical background and its organizational implementation have to be well founded. We worked with regional companies that develop software in order to learn about their distinct weaknesses and strengths with regard to testing. Analyzing and comparing the strengths, we derived best practices. In this paper we explain the project's background and sketch the design science research methodology used. We then introduce a graphical categorization framework that helps companies in judging the applicability of recommendations. Eventually, we present details on five recommendations for tech-nical aspects of testing. For each recommendation we give im-plementation advice based on the categorization framework.",

	{'abstract': u'Computer experiments are performed to investigate why protein contact networks (networks induced by spatial contacts between amino acid residues of a protein) do not have shorter average shortest path lengths in spite of their importance to protein folding. We find that shorter average inter-nodal distances is no guarantee of finding a global optimum more easily. Results from the experiments also led to observations which parallel an existing view that neither short-range nor long-range interactions dominate the protein folding process. Nonetheless, runs where there was a slight delay in the use of long-range interactions yielded the best search performance. We incorporate this finding into the optimization function by giving more weight to short-range links. This produced results showing that randomizing long-range links does not yield better search performance than protein contact networks au natural even though randomizing long-range links significantly reduces average path lengths and retains much of the clustering and positive degree-degree correlation inherent in protein contact networks. Hence there can be explanations, other than the excluded volume argument, beneath the topological limits of protein contact networks.',

Rather than the default method of choosing a single threshold value about which to dichotomize, we consider a method of choosing the highest k outbound arcs from each person and assigning a binary tie, as this has the advantage of minimizing the isolation of nodes that may otherwise be weakly connected. However, simulations and real data sets establish that this method is worse than the default thresholding method and should not be generally considered to deal with valued networks.',

	{'abstract': u'Calibration in a multi camera network has widely been studied for over several years starting from the earlier days of photogrammetry. Many authors have presented several calibration algorithms with their relative advantages and disadvantages. In a stereovision system, multiple view reconstruction is a challenging task. However, the total computational procedure in detail has not been presented before. Here in this work, we are dealing with the problem that, when a world coordinate point is fixed in space, image coordinates of that 3D point vary for different camera positions and orientations. In computer vision aspect, this situation is undesirable. That is, the system has to be designed in such a way that image coordinate of the world coordinate point will be fixed irrespective of the position &amp; orientation of the cameras. We have done it in an elegant fashion. Firstly, camera parameters are calculated in its local coordinate system. Then, we use global coordinate data to transfer all local coordinate data of stereo cameras into same global coordinate system, so that we can register everything into this global coordinate system. After all the transformations, when the image coordinate of the world coordinate point is calculated, it gives same coordinate value for all camera positions &amp; orientations. That is, the whole system is calibrated.',

	{'abstract': u"Stability of Wardrop equilibria is analyzed for dynamical transportation networks in which the drivers' route choices are influenced by information at multiple temporal and spatial scales. The considered model involves a continuum of indistinguishable drivers commuting between a common origin/destination pair in an acyclic transportation network. The drivers' route choices are affected by their, relatively infrequent, perturbed best responses to global information about the current network congestion levels, as well as their instantaneous local observation of the immediate surroundings as they transit through the network. A novel model is proposed for the drivers' route choice behavior, exhibiting local consistency with their preference toward globally less congested paths as well as myopic decisions in favor of locally less congested paths. The simultaneous evolution of the traffic congestion on the network and of the aggregate path preference is modeled by a system of coupled ordinary differential equations. The main result shows that, if the frequency of updates of path preferences is sufficiently small as compared to the frequency of the traffic flow dynamics, then the state of the transportation network ultimately approaches a neighborhood of the Wardrop equilibrium. The presented results may be read as a further evidence in support of Wardrop's postulate of equilibrium, showing robustness of it with respect to non-persistent perturbations. The proposed analysis combines techniques from singular perturbation theory, evolutionary game theory, and cooperative dynamical systems.",

	{'abstract': u'Normally, program execution spends most of the time on loops. Automated test data generation devotes special attention to loops for better coverage. Automated test data generation for programs having loops with variable number of iteration and variable length array is a challenging problem. It is so because the number of paths may increase exponentially with the increase of array size for some programming constructs, like merge sort. We propose a method that finds heuristic for different types of programming constructs with loops and arrays. Linear search, Bubble sort, merge sort, and matrix multiplication programs are included in an attempt to highlight the difference in execution between single loop, variable length array and nested loops with one and two dimensional arrays. We have used two parameters/heuristics to predict the minimum number of iterations required for generating automated test data. They are longest path level (kL) and saturation level (kS). The proceedings of our work includes the instrumentation of source code at the elementary level, followed by the application of the random inputs until all feasible paths or all paths having longest paths are collected. However, duplicate paths are avoided by using a filter. Our test data is the random numbers that cover each feasible path.',

It is also shown that the usual generalized K-Ld subjected to this additive duality, known as the dual generalized K-Ld, is a scaled Bregman divergence.

	{'abstract': u'Asynchronous programming is a ubiquitous systems programming idiom to manage concurrent interactions with the environment. In this style, instead of waiting for time-consuming operations to complete, the programmer makes a non-blocking call to the operation and posts a callback task to a task buffer that is executed later when the time-consuming operation completes. A co-operative scheduler mediates the interaction by picking and executing callback tasks from the task buffer to completion (and these callbacks can post further callbacks to be executed later). Writing correct asynchronous programs is hard because the use of callbacks, while efficient, obscures program control flow. We provide a formal model underlying asynchronous programs and study verification problems for this model. We show that the safety verification problem for finite-data asynchronous programs is expspace-complete. We show that liveness verification for finite-data asynchronous programs is decidable and polynomial-time equivalent to Petri Net reachability. Decidability is not obvious, since even if the data is finite-state, asynchronous programs constitute infinite-state transition systems: both the program stack and the task buffer of pending asynchronous calls can be potentially unbounded. Our main technical construction is a polynomial-time semantics-preserving reduction from asynchronous programs to Petri Nets and conversely. The reduction allows the use of algorithmic techniques on Petri Nets to the verification of asynchronous programs. We also study several extensions to the basic models of asynchronous programs that are inspired by additional capabilities provided by implementations of asynchronous libraries, and classify the decidability and undecidability of verification questions on these extensions.',

	{'abstract': u'The Saratoga transfer protocol was developed by Surrey Satellite Technology Ltd (SSTL) for its Disaster Monitoring Constellation (DMC) satellites. In over seven years of operation, Saratoga has provided efficient delivery of remote-sensing Earth observation imagery, across private wireless links, from these seven low-orbit satellites to ground stations, using the Internet Protocol (IP). Saratoga is designed to cope with high bandwidth-delay products, constrained acknowledgement channels, and high loss while streaming or delivering extremely large files. An implementation of this protocol has now been developed at the Australian Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) for wider use and testing. This is intended to prototype delivery of data across dedicated astronomy radio telescope networks on the ground, where networked sensors in Very Long Baseline Interferometer (VLBI) instruments generate large amounts of data for processing and can send that data across private IP- and Ethernet-based links at very high rates. We describe this new Saratoga implementation, its features and focus on high throughput and link utilization, and lessons learned in developing this protocol for sensor-network applications.',

Misbehavior is challenged by bandwidth and energy efficient medium access control and fair share of throughput. Node misbehavior plays an important role in MANET. In this survey, few of the contention window misbehavior is reviewed and compared. The contention window cheating either minimizes the active communication of the network or reduces bandwidth utilization of a particular node. The classification presented is in no case unique but summarizes the chief characteristics of many published proposals for contention window cheating. After getting insight into the different contention window misbehavior, few of the enhancements that can be done to improve the existing contention window are suggested. The purpose of this paper is to facilitate the research efforts in combining the existing solutions to offer more efficient methods to reduce contention window cheating mechanisms.',

	{'abstract': u"We show that two important problems that have applications in computational biology are ASP-complete, which implies that, given a solution to a problem, it is NP-complete to decide if another solution exists. We show first that a variation of Betweenness, which is the underlying problem of questions related to radiation hybrid mapping, is ASP-complete. Subsequently, we use that result to show that Quartet Compatibility, a fundamental problem in phylogenetics that asks whether a set of quartets can be represented by a parent tree, is also ASP-complete. The latter result shows that Steel's sc Quartet Challenge, which asks whether a solution to Quartet Compatibility is unique, is coNP-complete.",

	{'abstract': u'Alon and Krivelevich (SIAM J. Discrete Math. 15(2): 211-227 (2002)) show that if a graph is -far from bipartite, then the subgraph induced by a random subset of O(1/) vertices is bipartite with high probability. We conjecture that the induced subgraph is ~()-far from bipartite with high probability. Gonen and Ron (RANDOM 2007) proved this conjecture in the case when the degrees of all vertices are at most O(n). We give a more general proof that works for any d-regular (or almost d-regular) graph for arbitrary degree d. Assuming this conjecture, we prove that bipartiteness is testable with one-sided error in time O(1/^c), where c is a constant strictly smaller than two, improving upon the tester of Alon and Krivelevich. As it is known that non-adaptive testers for bipartiteness require (1/^2) queries (Bogdanov and Trevisan, CCC 2004), our result shows, assuming the conjecture, that adaptivity helps in testing bipartiteness.',

	{'abstract': u'A community of agents is subject to a stream of messages, which are represented as points on a plane of issues. Messages are sent by media and by agents themselves. Messages from media shape the public opinion. They are unbiased, i.e. positive and negative opinions on a given issue appear with equal frequencies. In our previous work, the only criterion to receive a message by an agent is if the distance between this message and the ones received earlier does not exceed the given value of the tolerance parameter. Here we introduce a possibility to address a message to a given neighbour. We show that this option reduces the unanimity effect, what improves the collective performance.',

	{'abstract': u'This paper introduces a combined approach for the recovery of a timetable by rescheduling trips and vehicle circulations for a rail-based transportation system subject to disruptions. We propose a novel event-based integer programming (IP) model. Features include shifting and canceling of trips as well as modifying the vehicle schedules by changing or truncating the circulations. The objective maximizes the number of recovered trips, possibly with delay, while guaranteeing a conflict-free new timetable for the estimated time window of the disruption. We demonstrate the usefulness of our approach through experiments for real-life test instances of relevant size, arising from the subway system of Vienna. We focus on scenarios in which one direction of one track is blocked, and trains have to be scheduled through this bottleneck. Solving these instances is made possible by contracting parts of the underlying event-activity graph; this allows a significant size reduction of the IP. Usually, the solutions found within one minute are of good quality and can be used as good estimates of recovery plans in an online context.',

	{'abstract': u'It is usual to consider that standards generate mixed feelings among scientists. They are often seen as not really reflecting the state of the art in a given domain and a hindrance to scientific creativity. Still, scientists should theoretically be at the best place to bring their expertise into standard developments, being even more neutral on issues that may typically be related to competing industrial interests. Even if it could be thought of as even more complex to think about developping standards in the humanities, we will show how this can be made feasible through the experience gained both within the Text Encoding Initiative consortium and the International Organisation for Standardisation. By taking the specific case of lexical resources, we will try to show how this brings about new ideas for designing future research infrastructures in the human and social sciences.',

	{'abstract': u'Networks composed from both connectivity and dependency links were found to be more vulnerable compared to classical networks with only connectivity links. Their percolation transition is usually of a first order compared to the second order transition found in classical networks. We analytically analyze the effect of different distributions of dependencies links on the robustness of networks. For a random Erds-Rnyi (ER) network with average degree that is divided into dependency clusters of size , the fraction of nodes that belong to the giant component, , is given by where is the initial fraction of removed nodes. Our general result coincides with the known Erds-Rnyi equation for random networks for and with the result of Parshani et al (PNAS, in press, 2011) for . For networks with Poissonian distribution of dependency links we find that is given by where and is the mean value of the size of dependency clusters. For networks with Gaussian distribution of dependency links we show how the average and width of the distribution affect the robustness of the networks.',

	{'abstract': u"With scaling of Vt sub-threshold leakage power is increasing and expected to become significant part of total power consumption In present work three new configurations of level shifters for low power application in 0.35m technology have been presented. The proposed circuits utilize the merits of stacking technique with smaller leakage current and reduction in leakage power. Conventional level shifter has been improved by addition of three NMOS transistors, which shows total power consumption of 402.2264pW as compared to 0.49833nW with existing circuit. Single supply level shifter has been modified with addition of two NMOS transistors that gives total power consumption of 108.641pW as compared to 31.06nW. Another circuit, contention mitigated level shifter (CMLS) with three additional transistors shows total power consumption of 396.75pW as compared to 0.4937354nW. Three proposed circuit's shows better performance in terms of power consumption with a little conciliation in delay. Output level of 3.3V has been obtained with input pulse of 1.6V for all proposed circuits.",

	{'abstract': u'Email Retrieval task has recently taken much attention to help the user retrieve the email(s) related to the submitted query. Up to our knowledge, existing email retrieval ranking approaches sort the retrieved emails based on some heuristic rules, which are either search clues or some predefined user criteria rooted in email fields. Unfortunately, the user usually does not know the effective rule that acquires best ranking related to his query. This paper presents a new email retrieval ranking approach to tackle this problem. It ranks the retrieved emails based on a scoring function that depends on crucial email fields, namely subject, content, and sender. The paper also proposes an architecture to allow every user in a network/group of users to be able, if permissible, to know the most important network senders who are interested in his submitted query words. The experimental evaluation on Enron corpus prove that our approach outperforms known email retrieval ranking approaches.',

	{'abstract': u'This paper presents an optimum technique based on the least squares method for the derivation of the bubble functions to enrich the standard linear finite elements employed in the formulation of Galerkin weighted-residual statements. The element-level linear shape functions are enhanced with supplementary polynomial bubble functions with undetermined coefficients. The best least squares minimization of the residual functional obtained from the insertion of these trial functions into model equations results in an algebraic system of equations whose solution provides the unknown coefficients in terms of element-level nodal values. The normal finite element procedures for the construction of stiffness matrices may then be followed with no extra degree of freedom incurred as a result of such enrichment. The performance of the proposed method has been tested on a number of benchmark linear transport equations with the results compared against the exact and standard linear element solutions. It has been observed that low order bubble enriched elements produce more accurate approximations than the standard linear elements with no extra computational cost despite employing relatively crude mesh. However, for the solution of strongly convection or reaction dominated problems significantly higher order enrichments as well as extra mesh refinements will be required.',

	{'abstract': u'The paper presents realization theory of discrete-time linear switched systems. A discrete-time linear switched system is a hybrid system, such that the continuous sub-system associated with each discrete state is linear. In this paper we present necessary and sufficient conditions for an input-output map to admit a discrete-time linear switched state-space realization. The conditions are formulated as finite rank conditions of a generalized Hankel-matrix. In addition, we present a characterization of minimality of discrete-time linear switched systems in terms of reachability and observable.Further, we prove that minimal realizations are unique up to isomorphism. We also discuss procedures for converting a linear switched system to a minimal one and we present an algorithm for constructing a state-space representation from input-output data.The paper uses the theory rational formal power series in non-commutative variables. The latter theory was successfully applied to bilinear and state-affine systems in the past.',

	{'abstract': u'The induction of a signaling pathway is characterized by transient complex formation and mutual posttranslational modification of proteins. To faithfully capture this combinatorial process in a mathematical model is an important challenge in systems biology. Exploiting the limited context on which most binding and modification events are conditioned, attempts have been made to reduce the combinatorial complexity by quotienting the reachable set of molecular species, into species aggregates while preserving the deterministic semantics of the thermodynamic limit. Recently we proposed a quotienting that also preserves the stochastic semantics and that is complete in the sense that the semantics of individual species can be recovered from the aggregate semantics. In this paper we prove that this quotienting yields a sufficient condition for weak lumpability and that it gives rise to a backward Markov bisimulation between the original and aggregated transition system. We illustrate the framework on a case study of the EGF/insulin receptor crosstalk.',

	{'abstract': u'Based on the misleading expectation that weighted network properties always offer a more complete description than purely topological ones, current economic models of the International Trade Network (ITN) generally aim at explaining local weighted properties, not local binary ones. Here we complement our analysis of the binary projections of the ITN by considering its weighted representations. We show that, unlike the binary case, all possible weighted representations of the ITN (directed/undirected, aggregated/disaggregated) cannot be traced back to local country-specific properties, which are therefore of limited informativeness. Our two papers show that traditional macroeconomic approaches systematically fail to capture the key properties of the ITN. In the binary case, they do not focus on the degree sequence and hence cannot characterize or replicate higher-order properties. In the weighted case, they generally focus on the strength sequence, but the knowledge of the latter is not enough in order to understand or reproduce indirect effects.',

We present native P system versions of two fundamental problems in graph theory: finding the maximum number of edge- and node-disjoint paths between a source node and target node. We start from the standard depth-first-search maximum flow algorithms, but our approach is totally distributed, when initially no structural information is available and each P system cell has to even learn its immediate neighbors. For the node-disjoint version, our P system rules are designed to enforce node weight capacities (of one), in addition to edge capacities (of one), which are not readily available in the standard network flow algorithms.',

	{'abstract': u'Suppose that multiple experts (or learning algorithms) provide us with alternative Bayesian network (BN) structures over a domain, and that we are interested in combining them into a single consensus BN structure. Specifically, we are interested in that the consensus BN structure only represents independences all the given BN structures agree upon and that it has as few parameters associated as possible. In this paper, we prove that there may exist several non-equivalent consensus BN structures and that finding one of them is NP-hard. Thus, we decide to resort to heuristics to find an approximated consensus BN structure. In this paper, we consider the heuristic proposed in citep. This heuristic builds upon two algorithms, called Methods A and B, for efficiently deriving the minimal directed independence map of a BN structure relative to a given node ordering. Methods A and B are claimed to be correct although no proof is provided (a proof is just sketched). In this paper, we show that Methods A and B are not correct and propose a correction of them.',

	{'abstract': u'The international trade network (ITN) has received renewed multidisciplinary interest due to recent advances in network theory. However, it is still unclear whether a network approach conveys additional, nontrivial information with respect to traditional international-economics analyses that describe world trade only in terms of local (first-order) properties. In this and in a companion paper, we employ a recently proposed randomization method to assess in detail the role that local properties have in shaping higher-order patterns of the ITN in all its possible representations (binary/weighted, directed/undirected, aggregated/disaggregated by commodity) and across several years. Here we show that, remarkably, the properties of all binary projections of the network can be completely traced back to the degree sequence, which is therefore maximally informative. Our results imply that explaining the observed degree sequence of the ITN, which has not received particular attention in economic theory, should instead become one the main focuses of models of trade.',

	{'abstract': u'The modelling and analysis of biological systems has deep roots in Mathematics, specifically in the field of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Alternative approaches based on formal calculi, often derived from process algebras or term rewriting systems, provide a quite complementary way to analyze the behaviour of biological systems. These calculi allow to cope in a natural way with notions like compartments and membranes, which are not easy (sometimes impossible) to handle with purely numerical approaches, and are often based on stochastic simulation methods. Recently, it has also become evident that stochastic effects in regulatory networks play a crucial role in the analysis of such systems. Actually, in many situations it is necessary to use stochastic models. For example when the system to be described is based on the interaction of few molecules, when we are at the presence of a chemical instability, or when we want to simulate the functioning of a pool of entities whose compartmentalised structure evolves dynamically. In contrast, stable metabolic networks, involving a large number of reagents, for which the computational cost of a stochastic simulation becomes an insurmountable obstacle, are efficiently modelled with ODEs. In this paper we define a hybrid simulation method, combining the stochastic approach with ODEs, for systems described in CWC, a calculus on which we can express the compartmentalisation of a biological system whose evolution is defined by a set of rewrite rules.',

	{'abstract': u'Many complex systems can be represented as networks, and how a network breaks up into subnetworks or communities is of wide interest. However, the development of a method to detect nodes important to communities that is both fast and accurate is a very challenging and open problem. In this manuscript, we introduce a new approach to characterize the node importance to communities. First, a centrality metric is proposed to measure the importance of network nodes to community structure using the spectrum of the adjacency matrix. We define the node importance to communities as the relative change in the eigenvalues of the network adjacency matrix upon their removal. Second, we also propose an index to distinguish two kinds of important nodes in communities, i.e., "community core" and "bridge". Our indices are only relied on the spectrum of the graph matrix. They are applied in many artificial networks as well as many real-world networks. This new methodology gives us a basic approach to solve this challenging problem and provides a realistic result.',

	{'abstract': u'Delays in biological systems may be used to model events for which the underlying dynamics cannot be precisely observed, or to provide abstraction of some behavior of the system resulting more compact models. In this paper we enrich the stochastic process algebra Bio-PEPA, with the possibility of assigning delays to actions, yielding a new non-Markovian process algebra: Bio-PEPAd. This is a conservative extension meaning that the original syntax of Bio-PEPA is retained and the delay specification which can now be associated with actions may be added to existing Bio-PEPA models. The semantics of the firing of the actions with delays is the delay-as-duration approach, earlier presented in papers on the stochastic simulation of biological systems with delays. These semantics of the algebra are given in the Starting-Terminating style, meaning that the state and the completion of an action are observed as two separate events, as required by delays. Furthermore we outline how to perform stochastic simulation of Bio-PEPAd systems and how to automatically translate a Bio-PEPAd system into a set of Delay Differential Equations, the deterministic framework for modeling of biological systems with delays. We end the paper with two example models of biological systems with delays to illustrate the approach.',

	{'abstract': u'In this paper, we propose a new model that allows us to investigate this competitive aspect of real networks in quantitative terms. Through theoretical analysis and numerical simulations, we find that the competitive network have the universality for a weighted network. The relation between parameters in the weighted network and the competitiveness in the competitive network is obtained. So we can use the expression of the degree distribution of the competitive model to calculate that and the strength of the weighted network directly. The analytical solution reveals that the degree distribution of the weighted network is correlated with the increment and initial value of edge weights, which is verified by numerical simulations. Moreover, the evolving pattern of a clustering coefficient along with network parameters such as the size of a network, an updating coefficient, an initial weight and the competitiveness are obtained by further simulations. Specially, it is necessary to point out that the initial weight plays equally significant role as updating coefficient in influencing the topological characteristics of the network.',

	{'abstract': u'Recovering sparse vectors and low-rank matrices from noisy linear measurements has been the focus of much recent research. Various reconstruction algorithms have been studied, including and nuclear norm minimization as well as minimization with . These algorithms are known to succeed if certain conditions on the measurement map are satisfied. Proofs of robust recovery for matrices have so far been much more involved than in the vector case. In this paper, we show how several robust classes of recovery conditions can be extended from vectors to matrices in a simple and transparent way, leading to the best known restricted isometry and nullspace conditions for matrix recovery. Our results rely on the ability to "vectorize" matrices through the use of a key singular value inequality.',

	{'abstract': u'Many biological phenomena are inherently multiscale, i.e. they are characterized by interactions involving different spatial and temporal scales simultaneously. Though several approaches have been proposed to provide "multilayer" models, only Complex Automata, derived from Cellular Automata, naturally embed spatial information and realize multiscaling with well-established inter-scale integration schemas. Spatial P systems, a variant of P systems in which a more geometric concept of space has been added, have several characteristics in common with Cellular Automata. We propose such a formalism as a basis to rephrase the Complex Automata multiscaling approach and, in this perspective, provide a 2-scale Spatial P system describing bone remodelling. The proposed model not only results to be highly faithful and expressive in a multiscale scenario, but also highlights the need of a deep and formal expressiveness study involving Complex Automata, Spatial P systems and other promising multiscale approaches, such as our shape-based one already resulted to be highly faithful.',

	{'abstract': u'A model for statistical ranking is a family of probability distributions whose states are orderings of a fixed finite set of items. We represent the orderings as maximal chains in a graded poset. The most widely used ranking models are parameterized by rational function in the model parameters, so they define algebraic varieties. We study these varieties from the perspective of combinatorial commutative algebra. One of our models, the Plackett-Luce model, is non-toric. Five others are toric: the Birkhoff model, the ascending model, the Csiszar model, the inversion model, and the Bradley-Terry model. For these models we examine the toric algebra, its lattice polytope, and its Markov basis.',

	{'abstract': u'We propose a variant of the CCS process algebra with new features aiming at allowing multiscale modelling of biological systems. In the usual semantics of process algebras for modelling biological systems actions are instantaneous. When different scale levels of biological systems are considered in a single model, one should take into account that actions at a level may take much more time than actions at a lower level. Moreover, it might happen that while a component is involved in one long lasting high level action, it is involved also in several faster lower level actions. Hence, we propose a process algebra with operations and with a semantics aimed at dealing with these aspects of multiscale modelling. We study behavioural equivalences for such an algebra and give some examples.',

	{'abstract': u'It is shown how information contained in the pairwise correlations (in general, partial) between atoms of a gas can be used to completely convert heat taken from a thermostat into mechanical work in a process of relaxation of the system to its thermal equilibrium state. Both classical correlations and quantum correlations (entanglement) are considered. The amount of heat converted into work is proportional to the entropy defect of the initial state of the system. For fully correlated particles, in the case of entanglement the amount of work obtained per particle is twice as large as in the case of classical correlations. However, in the case of entanglement, the amount of work does not depend on the degree of correlation, in contrast to the case of classical correlations. The results explicitly demonstrate the equivalence relation between information and work for the case of two-particle correlations.',

We note first that CTC traversal can be interpreted in two distinct ways, depending on ones understanding of spacetime. Focussing on one interpretation leads us to develop a toy universe in which no CTC can be traversed more than once, whence no computational speedup is possible. Focussing on the second (and more standard) interpretation leads to the surprising conclusion that CTCs act as perfect information repositories: just as black holes have entropy, so do CTCs. If we also assume that P is not equal to NP, we find that all observers agree that, even if unbounded time travel existed in their youth, this capability eventually vanishes as they grow older. Thus the computational assumption "P is not NP" is also an assumption concerning cosmological structure.',

	{'abstract': u'Complexity of fluid flow in a rough fracture is induced by the complex configurations of opening areas between the fracture planes. In this study, we model fluid flow in an evolvable real rock joint structure, which under certain normal load is sheared. In an experimental study, information regarding about apertures of the rock joint during consecutive 20 mm displacements and fluid flow (permeability) in different pressure heads have been recorded by a scanner laser. Our aim in this study is to simulate the fluid flow in the mentioned complex geometries using the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM), while the characteristics of the aperture field will be compared with the modeled fluid flow permeability To characterize the aperture, we use a new concept in the graph theory, namely: complex networks and motif analysis of the corresponding networks. In this approach, the similar aperture profile along the fluid flow direction is mapped in to a network space. The modeled permeability using the LBM shows good correlation with the experimental measured values. Furthermore, the two main characters of the obtained networks, i.e., characteristic length and number of edges show the same evolutionary trend with the modeled permeability values.

	{'abstract': u'We give a stochastic extension of the Brane Calculus, along the lines of recent work by Cardelli and Mardare. In this presentation, the semantics of a Brane process is a measure of the stochastic distribution of possible derivations. To this end, we first introduce a labelled transition system for Brane Calculus, proving its adequacy w.r.t. the usual reduction semantics. Then, brane systems are presented as Markov processes over the measurable space generated by terms up-to syntactic congruence, and where the measures are indexed by the actions of this new LTS. Finally, we provide a SOS presentation of this stochastic semantics, which is compositional and syntax-driven.',

	{'abstract': u'Opinion dynamics of random-walking agents on finite two-dimensional lattices is studied. In the model, the opinion is continuous, and both the lattice and the opinion can be either periodic or non-periodic. At each time step, all agents move randomly on the lattice, and update their opinions based on those of neighbors with whom the differences of opinions are not greater than a given threshold. Due to the effect of repeated averaging, opinions first converge locally, and eventually reach steady states. Like other models with bounded confidence, steady states in general are those with one or more opinion groups, in which all agents have the same opinion. When both the lattice and the opinion are periodic, however, metastable states, in which the whole spectrum of location-dependent opinions can coexist, can emerge. This result shows that, when a set of continuous opinions forms a structure like a circle, other that a typically-used linear opinions, rich dynamic behavior can arise. When there are geographical restrictions in reality, a complete consensus is rarely reached, and metastable states here can be one of the explanations for these situations, especially when opinions are not linear.',

We also define the concept of a homogenious society that is a graph with probabilistic thresholds satisfying some conditions and obtain a bound for the smallest size of its dynamos. Finally we consider dynamic monopoly of line graphs and obtain some bounds for their sizes and determine the exact values in some special cases.',

	{'abstract': u"Biological systems typically involve large numbers of components with complex, highly parallel interactions and intrinsic stochasticity. To model this complexity, numerous programming languages based on process calculi have been developed, many of which are expressive enough to generate unbounded numbers of molecular species and reactions. As a result of this expressiveness, such calculi cannot rely on standard reaction-based simulation methods, which require fixed numbers of species and reactions. Rather than implementing custom stochastic simulation algorithms for each process calculus, we propose to use a generic abstract machine that can be instantiated to a range of process calculi and a range of reaction-based simulation algorithms. The abstract machine functions as a just-in-time compiler, which dynamically updates the set of possible reactions and chooses the next reaction in an iterative cycle. In this short paper we give a brief summary of the generic abstract machine, and show how it can be instantiated with the stochastic simulation algorithm known as Gillespie's Direct Method. We also discuss the wider implications of such an abstract machine, and outline how it can be used to simulate multiple calculi simultaneously within a common framework.",

	{'abstract': u'This paper introduces a new method for proving global stability of fluid flows through the construction of Lyapunov functionals. For finite dimensional approximations of fluid systems, we show how one can exploit recently developed optimization methods based on sum-of-squares decomposition to construct a polynomial Lyapunov function. We then show how these methods can be extended to infinite dimensional Navier-Stokes systems using robust optimization techniques. Crucially, this extension requires only the solution of infinite-dimensional linear eigenvalue problems and finite-dimensional sum-of-squares optimization problems. We further show that subject to minor technical constraints, a general polynomial Lyapunov function is always guaranteed to provide better results than the classical energy methods in determining a lower-bound on the maximum Reynolds number for which a flow is globally stable, if the flow does remain globally stable for Reynolds numbers at least slightly beyond the energy stability limit. Such polynomial functions can be searched for efficiently using the SOS technique we propose.',

	{'abstract': u'Perfect Space-Time Codes (STC) are optimal codes in their original construction for Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) systems. Based on Cyclic Division Algebras (CDA), they are full-rate, full-diversity codes, have Non-Vanishing Determinants (NVD) and hence achieve Diversity-Multiplexing Tradeoff (DMT). In addition, these codes have led to optimal distributed space-time codes when applied in cooperative networks under the assumption of perfect synchronization between relays. However, they loose their diversity when delays are introduced and thus are not delay-tolerant. In this paper, using the cyclic division algebras of perfect codes, we construct new codes that maintain the same properties as perfect codes in the synchronous case. Moreover, these codes preserve their full-diversity in asynchronous transmission.',

	{'abstract': u"Research on the growth of online tagging systems not only is interesting in its own right, but also yields insights for website management and semantic web analysis. Traditional models that describing the growth of online systems can be divided between linear and nonlinear versions. Linear models, including the BA model (Brabasi and Albert, 1999), assume that the average activity of users is a constant independent of population. Hence the total activity is a linear function of population. On the contrary, nonlinear models suggest that the average activity is affected by the size of the population and the total activity is a nonlinear function of population. In the current study, supporting evidences for the nonlinear growth assumption are obtained from data on Internet users' tagging behavior. A power law relationship between the number of new tags (F) and the population (P), which can be expressed as F ~ P ^ gamma (gamma &gt; 1), is found. I call this pattern accelerating growth and find it relates the to time-invariant heterogeneity in individual activities. I also show how a greater heterogeneity leads to a faster growth.",

In a social context, nevertheless, individual choices toward a specific attitude are also at the basis of the formation of communities, groups and parties. The membership in a group changes completely the behavior of single agents who start acting according to a social identity. Groups act and interact among them as single entities, but still conserve an internal dynamics. We show that, under certain conditions of social dynamics, the introduction of group dynamics in a cultural dissemination process avoids the flattening of the culture into a single entity and preserves the multiplicity of cultural attitudes. We also considered diffusion processes on this dynamical background, showing the conditions under which information as well as innovation can spread through the population in a scenario where the groups' choices determine the social structure.",

Online learning algorithms provide powerful guarantees of this form, and have often been proposed for use with non-stationary processes because of their ability to switch between different forecasters or ``experts''. However, existing methods assume that the set of experts whose forecasts are to be combined are all given at the start, which is not plausible when dealing with a genuinely historical or evolutionary system. We show how to modify the ``fixed shares'' algorithm for tracking the best expert to cope with a steadily growing set of experts, obtained by fitting new models to new data as it becomes available, and obtain regret bounds for the growing ensemble.",

	{'abstract': u'The number of triangles is a computationally expensive graph statistic which is frequently used in complex network analysis (e.g., transitivity ratio), in various random graph models (e.g., exponential random graph model) and in important real world applications such as spam detection, uncovering of the hidden thematic structure of the Web and link recommendation. Counting triangles in graphs with millions and billions of edges requires algorithms which run fast, use small amount of space, provide accurate estimates of the number of triangles and preferably are parallelizable. In this paper we present an efficient triangle counting algorithm which can be adapted to the semistreaming model. The key idea of our algorithm is to combine the sampling algorithm of Tsourakakis et al. and the partitioning of the set of vertices into a high degree and a low degree subset respectively as in the Alon, Yuster and Zwick work treating each set appropriately. We obtain a running time and an approximation (multiplicative error), where is the number of vertices, the number of edges and the maximum number of triangles an edge is contained. Furthermore, we show how this algorithm can be adapted to the semistreaming model with space usage and a constant number of passes (three) over the graph stream. We apply our methods in various networks with several millions of edges and we obtain excellent results. Finally, we propose a random projection based method for triangle counting and provide a sufficient condition to obtain an estimate with low variance.',

	{'abstract': u'In this paper we investigate to which extent a very simple and natural "reachability as deducibility" approach, originated in the research in formal methods in security, is applicable to the automated verification of large classes of infinite state and parameterized systems. The approach is based on modeling the reachability between (parameterized) states as deducibility between suitable encodings of states by formulas of first-order predicate logic. The verification of a safety property is reduced to a pure logical problem of finding a countermodel for a first-order formula. The later task is delegated then to the generic automated finite model building procedures. In this paper we first establish the relative completeness of the finite countermodel finding method (FCM) for a class of parameterized linear arrays of finite automata. The method is shown to be at least as powerful as known methods based on monotonic abstraction and symbolic backward reachability. Further, we extend the relative completeness of the approach and show that it can solve all safety verification problems which can be solved by the traditional regular model checking.',

	{'abstract': u'Several variations of hat guessing games have been popularly discussed in recreational mathematics. In a typical hat guessing game, after initially coordinating a strategy, each of players is assigned a hat from a given color set. Simultaneously, each player tries to guess the color of his/her own hat by looking at colors of hats worn by other players. In this paper, we consider a new variation of this game, in which we require at least correct guesses and no wrong guess for the players to win the game, but they can choose to "pass". A strategy is called if it can achieve the simple upper bound of the winning probability. We present sufficient and necessary condition on the parameters and for the existence of perfect strategy in the hat guessing games. In fact for any fixed parameter , the existence of perfect strategy can be determined for every sufficiently large . In our construction we introduce a new notion: -regular partition of the boolean hypercube, which is worth to study in its own right. For example, it is related to the -dominating set of the hypercube. It also might be interesting in coding theory. The existence of -regular partition is explored in the paper and the existence of perfect -dominating set follows as a corollary.',

In this regard, it appears to be similar to many sparse PCA methods. However, CUR takes a randomized algorithmic approach, whereas most sparse PCA methods are framed as convex optimization problems. In this paper, we try to understand CUR from a sparse optimization viewpoint. We show that CUR is implicitly optimizing a sparse regression objective and, furthermore, cannot be directly cast as a sparse PCA method. We also observe that the sparsity attained by CUR possesses an interesting structure, which leads us to formulate a sparse PCA method that achieves a CUR-like sparsity.',

Unfortunately, the user usually does not know the effective rule that acquires best ranking related to his query. This paper presents a new email retrieval ranking approach to tackle this problem. It ranks the retrieved emails based on a scoring function that depends on crucial email fields, namely subject, content, and sender. The paper also proposes an architecture to allow every user in a network/group of users to be able, if permissible, to know the most important network senders who are interested in his submitted query words.

	{'abstract': u'We classify the computational content of the Bolzano-Weierstrass Theorem and variants thereof in the Weihrauch lattice. For this purpose we first introduce the concept of a derivative or jump in this lattice and we show that it has some properties similar to the Turing jump. Using this concept we prove that the derivative of closed choice of a computable metric space is the cluster point problem of that space. By specialization to sequences with a relatively compact range we obtain a characterization of the Bolzano-Weierstrass Theorem as the derivative of compact choice. In particular, this shows that the Bolzano-Weierstrass Theorem on real numbers is the jump of Weak K "onig\'s Lemma. Likewise, the Bolzano-Weierstrass Theorem on the binary space is the jump of the lesser limited principle of omniscience LLPO and the Bolzano-Weierstrass Theorem on natural numbers can be characterized as the jump of the idempotent closure of LLPO. We also introduce the compositional product of two Weihrauch degrees f and g as the supremum of the composition of any two functions below f and g, respectively. We can express the main result such that the Bolzano-Weierstrass Theorem is the compositional product of Weak K "onig\'s Lemma and the Monotone Convergence Theorem. We also study the class of weakly limit computable functions, which are functions that can be obtained by composition of weakly computable functions with limit computable functions. We prove that the Bolzano-Weierstrass Theorem on real numbers is complete for this class. Likewise, the unique cluster point problem on real numbers is complete for the class of functions that are limit computable with finitely many mind changes. We also prove that the Bolzano-Weierstrass Theorem on real numbers and, more generally, the unbounded cluster point problem on real numbers is uniformly low limit computable.

	{'abstract': u'In order to conduct analyses of networked systems where connections between individuals take on a range of values - counts, continuous strengths or ordinal rankings - a common technique is to dichotomize the data according to their positions with respect to a threshold value. However, there are two issues to consider: how the results of the analysis depend on the choice of threshold, and what role the presence of noise has on a system with respect to a fixed threshold value. We show that while there are principled criteria of keeping information from the valued graph in the dichotomized version, they produce such a wide range of binary graphs that only a fraction of the relevant information will be kept. Additionally, while dichotomization of predictors in linear models has a known asymptotic efficiency loss, the same process applied to network edges in a time series model will lead to an efficiency loss that grows larger as the network increases in size.',

	{'abstract': u'In many applications, it is important to derive information about the topology and the internal connections of dynamical systems interacting together. Examples can be found in fields as diverse as Economics, Neuroscience and Biochemistry. The paper deals with the problem of deriving a descriptive model of a network, collecting the node outputs as time series with no use of a priori insight on the topology, and unveiling an unknown structure as the estimate of a "sparse Wiener filter". A geometric interpretation of the problem in a pre-Hilbert space for wide-sense stochastic processes is provided. We cast the problem as the optimization of a cost function where a set of parameters are used to operate a trade-off between accuracy and complexity in the final model. The problem of reducing the complexity is addressed by fixing a certain degree of sparsity and finding the solution that "better" satisfies the constraints according to the criterion of approximation. Applications starting from real data and numerical simulations are provided.',

	{'abstract': u'We study the time-bounded reachability problem for continuous-time Markov decision processes (CTMDPs) and games (CTMGs). Existing techniques for this problem use discretisation techniques to break time into discrete intervals, and optimal control is approximated for each interval separately. Current techniques provide an accuracy of O( epsilon^2) on each interval, which leads to an infeasibly large number of intervals. We propose a sequence of approximations that achieve accuracies of O( epsilon^3), O( epsilon^4), and O( epsilon^5), that allow us to drastically reduce the number of intervals that are considered. For CTMDPs, the performance of the resulting algorithms is comparable to the heuristic approach given by Buckholz and Schulz, while also being theoretically justified. All of our results generalise to CTMGs, where our results yield the first practically implementable algorithms for this problem. We also provide positional strategies for both players that achieve similar error bounds.',

	{'abstract': u'In order to detect patterns in real networks, randomized graph ensembles that preserve only part of the topology of an observed network are systematically used as fundamental null models. However, their generation is still problematic. The existing approaches are either computationally demanding and beyond analytic control, or analytically accessible but highly approximate. Here we propose a solution to this long-standing problem by introducing an exact and fast method that allows to obtain expectation values and standard deviations of any topological property analytically, for any binary, weighted, directed or undirected network. Remarkably, the time required to obtain the expectation value of any property is as short as that required to compute the same property on the single original network. Our method reveals that the null behavior of various correlation properties is different from what previously believed, and highly sensitive to the particular network considered. Moreover, our approach shows that important structural properties (such as the modularity used in community detection problems) are currently based on incorrect expressions, and provides the exact quantities that should replace them.',

As the infrastructure of aviation industry, the airport network is one of the most important indicators of economic growth. In this paper, we investigate the evolution of Chinese airport network (CAN) via complex network theory. It is found that although the topology of CAN remains steady during the past several years, there are many dynamic switchings inside the network, which changes the relative relevance of airports and airlines. Moreover, we investigate the evolution of traffic flow (passengers and cargoes) on CAN. It is found that the traffic keeps growing in an exponential form and it has evident seasonal fluctuations. We also found that cargo traffic and passenger traffic are positively related but the correlations are quite different for different kinds of cities.",

However, current peer-to-peer information sharing systems work mostly on wired networks. With the growing number of communication-equipped mobile devices that can self-organize into infrastructure-less communication platform, namely mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs), peer-to-peer information sharing over MANETs becomes a promising research area. In this paper, we propose a Region-Based structure that enables efficient and secure peer-to-peer information sharing over MANETs.

	{'abstract': u'This work presents a distributed method for control centers to monitor the operating condition of a power network, i.e., to estimate the network state, and to ultimately determine the occurrence of threatening situations. State estimation has been recognized to be a fundamental task for network control centers to ensure correct and safe functionalities of power grids. We consider (static) state estimation problems, in which the state vector consists of the voltage magnitude and angle at all network buses. We consider the state to be linearly related to network measurements, which include power flows, current injections, and voltages phasors at some buses. We admit the presence of several cooperating control centers, and we design two distributed methods for them to compute the minimum variance estimate of the state given the network measurements. The two distributed methods rely on different modes of cooperation among control centers: in the first method an incremental mode of cooperation is used, whereas, in the second method, a diffusive interaction is implemented. Our procedures, which require each control center to know only the measurements and structure of a subpart of the whole network, are computationally efficient and scalable with respect to the network dimension, provided that the number of control centers also increases with the network cardinality. Additionally, a finite-memory approximation of our diffusive algorithm is proposed, and its accuracy is characterized. Finally, our estimation methods are exploited to develop a distributed algorithm to detect corrupted data among the network measurements.',

	{'abstract': u"We introduce a probabilistic version of the classical Perron's method to construct viscosity solutions to linear parabolic equations associated to stochastic differential equations. Using this method, we construct easily two viscosity (sub and super) solutions that squeeze in between the expected payoff. If a comparison result holds true, then there exists a unique viscosity solution which is a martingale along the solutions of the stochastic differential equation. The unique viscosity solution is actually equal to the expected payoff. This amounts to a verification result (Ito's Lemma) for non-smooth viscosity solutions of the linear parabolic equation. This is the first step in a larger program to prove verification for viscosity solutions and the Dynamic Programming Principle for stochastic control problems and games",

	{'abstract': u'A typical complex system should be described by a supernetwork or a network of networks, in which the networks are coupled to some other networks. As the first step to understanding the complex systems on such more systematic level, scientists studied interdependent multilayer networks. In this letter, we introduce a new kind of interdependent multilayer networks, i.e., interconnecting networks, for which the component networks are coupled each other by sharing some common nodes. Based on the empirical investigations, we revealed a common feature of such interconnecting networks, namely, the networks with smaller averaged topological differences of the interconnecting nodes tend to share more nodes. A very simple node sharing mechanism is proposed to analytically explain the observed feature of the interconnecting networks.',

	{'abstract': u'In the game of pegging, each vertex of a graph is considered a hole into which a peg can be placed. A pegging move is performed by jumping one peg over another peg, and then removing the peg that has been jumped over from the graph. We define the pegging number as the smallest number of pegs needed to reach all the vertices in a graph no matter what the distribution. Similarly, the optimal-pegging number of a graph is defined as the smallest distribution of pegs for which all the vertices in the graph can be reached. We obtain tight bounds on the pegging numbers and optimal-pegging numbers of complete binary trees and compute the optimal-pegging numbers of complete infinitary trees. As a result of these computations, we deduce that there is a tree whose optimal-pegging number is strictly increased by removing a leaf. We also compute the optimal-pegging number of caterpillar graphs and the tightest upper bound on the optimal-pegging numbers of lobster graphs.',

	{'abstract': u'We introduce a new approach to isolate the real roots of a square-free polynomial with real coefficients. It is assumed that each coefficient of can be approximated to any specified error bound. The presented method is exact, complete and deterministic. Due to its similarities to the Descartes method, we also consider it practical and easy to implement. Compared to previous approaches, our new method achieves a significantly better bit complexity. It is further shown that the hardness of isolating the real roots of is exclusively determined by the geometry of the roots and not by the complexity or the size of the coefficients. For the special case where has integer coefficients of maximal bitsize , our bound on the bit complexity writes as which improves the best bounds known for existing practical algorithms by a factor of . The crucial idea underlying the new approach is to run an approximate version of the Descartes method, where, in each subdivision step, we only consider approximations of the intermediate results to a certain precision. We give an upper bound on the maximal precision that is needed for isolating the roots of . For integer polynomials, this bound is by a factor lower than that of the precision needed when using exact arithmetic explaining the improved bound on the bit complexity.',

	{'abstract': u'Bounded confidence models of opinion dynamics have been actively studied in recent years, in particular, opinion formation and extremism propagation along with other aspects of social dynamics. In this work, after an analysis of limitations of the Deffuant-Weisbuch (DW) bounded confidence, relative agreement model, we propose the Mixed model that takes into account two psychological types of individuals. Concord agents (C-agents) are friendly people; they interact in a way that their opinions get closer always. Agents of the other psychological type show partial antagonism in their interaction (PA-agents). Opinion dynamics in heterogeneous social groups, consisting of agents of the two types, was studied on different social networks. Limit cases of the mixed model, pure C- and PA-societies, were also studied. We found that group opinion formation is, qualitatively, almost independent of the topology of networks used in this work. Opinion fragmentation, polarization and consensus are observed in the mixed model at different proportions of PA- and C-agents, depending on the value of initial opinion tolerance of agents. As for the opinion formation and arising of "dissidents", the opinion dynamics of the C-agents society was found to be similar to that of the DW model, except for the rate of opinion convergence. Nevertheless, mixed societies showed dynamics and bifurcation patterns notably different to those of the DW model. The influence of biased initial conditions over opinion formation in heterogeneous social groups was also studied versus the initial value of opinion uncertainty, varying the proportion of the PA- to C-agents. Bifurcation diagrams showed impressive evolution of collective opinion, in particular, radical change of left to right consensus or vice versa at an opinion uncertainty value equal to 0.7 in the model with the PA/C mixture of population near 50/50.',

	{'abstract': u'Solving an integer least squares (ILS) problem usually consists of two stages: reduction and search. This thesis is concerned with the reduction process for the ordinary ILS problem and the ellipsoid-constrained ILS problem. For the ordinary ILS problem, we dispel common misconceptions on the reduction stage in the literature and show what is crucial to the efficiency of the search process. The new understanding allows us to design a new reduction algorithm which is more efficient than the well-known LLL reduction algorithm. Numerical stability is taken into account in designing the new reduction algorithm. For the ellipsoid-constrained ILS problem, we propose a new reduction algorithm which, unlike existing algorithms, uses all the available information. Simulation results indicate that new algorithm can greatly reduce the computational cost of the search process when the measurement noise is large.',

	{'abstract': u'Imitation learning in robots, also called programing by demonstration, has made important advances in recent years, allowing humans to teach context dependant motor skills/tasks to robots. We propose to extend the usual contexts investigated to also include acoustic linguistic expressions that might denote a given motor skill, and thus we target joint learning of the motor skills and their potential acoustic linguistic name. In addition to this, a modification of a class of existing algorithms within the imitation learning framework is made so that they can handle the unlabeled demonstration of several tasks/motor primitives without having to inform the imitator of what task is being demonstrated or what the number of tasks are, which is a necessity for language learning, i.e; if one wants to teach naturally an open number of new motor skills together with their acoustic names. Finally, a mechanism for detecting whether or not linguistic input is relevant to the task is also proposed, and our architecture also allows the robot to find the right framing for a given identified motor primitive. With these additions it becomes possible to build an imitator that bridges the gap between imitation learning and language learning by being able to learn linguistic expressions using methods from the imitation learning community. In this sense the imitator can learn a word by guessing whether a certain speech pattern present in the context means that a specific task is to be executed. The imitator is however not assumed to know that speech is relevant and has to figure this out on its own by looking at the demonstrations: indeed, the architecture allows the robot to transparently also learn tasks which should not be triggered by an acoustic word, but for example by the color or position of an object or a gesture made by someone in the environment.

The resulting networks are general small-worlds similar to those a` la Watts and Strogatz but with a heterogeneous degree distribution. We prove that the critical behavior (thermal or percolative) remains completely unchanged by the presence of finite loops (or finite clustering). Then, we show that, in large but finite networks, correlations of two given spins may be strong, i.e., approximately power law like, at any temperature. Quite interestingly, if is the exponent for the power law distribution of the vertex degree, for and with or without short-range couplings, such strong correlations persist even in the thermodynamic limit, contradicting the common opinion that in mean-field models correlations always disappear in this limit. Finally, we provide the optimal choice of rewiring under which percolation phenomena in the rewired network are best performed; a natural criterion to reach best communication features, at least in non congested regimes.',

	{'abstract': u'In general frequent itemsets are generated from large data sets by applying association rule mining algorithms like Apriori, Partition, Pincer-Search, Incremental, Border algorithm etc., which take too much computer time to compute all the frequent itemsets. By using Genetic Algorithm (GA) we can improve the scenario. The major advantage of using GA in the discovery of frequent itemsets is that they perform global search and its time complexity is less compared to other algorithms as the genetic algorithm is based on the greedy approach. The main aim of this paper is to find all the frequent itemsets from given data sets using genetic algorithm.',

	{'abstract': u'The temporal communication patterns of human individuals are known to be inhomogeneous or bursty, which is reflected as the heavy tail behavior in the inter-event time distribution. As the cause of such bursty behavior two main mechanisms have been suggested: a) Inhomogeneities due to the circadian and weekly activity patterns and b) inhomogeneities rooted in human task execution behavior. Here we investigate the roles of these mechanisms by developing and then applying systematic de-seasoning methods to remove the circadian and weekly patterns from the time-series of mobile phone communication events of individuals. We find that the heavy tails in the inter-event time distributions remain robustly with respect to this procedure, which clearly indicates that the human task execution based mechanism is a possible cause for the remaining burstiness in temporal mobile phone communication patterns.',

Erdos, Lovasz, and Vesztergombi conjectured that m[1] + ... + m[k] &lt;= k*n. Using a new computational approach, we prove their conjecture when k &lt;= 4 and n is large; we also make some progress for arbitrary k by proving that m[1] + ... + m[k] &lt;= (2k-1)n. Our main approach revolves around a few known facts about distances, together with a computer program that searches all distance configurations of two disjoint convex hull intervals up to some finite size. We thereby obtain other new bounds such as m[3] &lt;= 3n/2 for large n.',

	{'abstract': u"It is well-known that the spacetime diagrams of some cellular automata have a fractal structure: for instance Pascal's triangle modulo 2 generates a Sierpinski triangle. Explaining the fractal structure of the spacetime diagrams of cellular automata is a much explored topic, but virtually all of the results revolve around a special class of automata, whose typical features include irreversibility, an alphabet with a ring structure, a global evolution that is a ring homomorphism, and a property known as (weakly) p-Fermat. The class of automata that we study in this article has none of these properties. Their cell structure is weaker, as it does not come with a multiplication, and they are far from being p-Fermat, even weakly. However, they do produce fractal spacetime diagrams, and we explain why and how.",

	{'abstract': u'For frequentist settings in which parameter randomness represents variability rather than uncertainty, the ideal measure of the support for one hypothesis over another is the difference in the posterior and prior log odds. For situations in which the prior distribution cannot be accurately estimated, that ideal support may be replaced by another measure of support, which may be any predictor of the ideal support that, on a per-observation basis, is asymptotically unbiased. Two qualifying measures of support are defined. The first is minimax optimal with respect to the population and is equivalent to a particular Bayes factor. The second is worst-sample minimax optimal and is equivalent to the normalized maximum likelihood. It has been extended by likelihood weights for compatibility with more general models. One such model is that of two independent normal samples, the standard setting for gene expression microarray data analysis. Applying that model to proteomics data indicates that support computed from data for a single protein can closely approximate the estimated difference in posterior and prior odds that would be available with the data for 20 proteins. This suggests the applicability of random-parameter models to other situations in which the parameter distribution cannot be reliably estimated.',

	{'abstract': u'Semantic Web is, without a doubt, gaining momentum in both industry and academia. The word "Semantic" refers to "meaning" - a semantic web is a web of meaning. In this fast changing and result oriented practical world, gone are the days where an individual had to struggle for finding information on the Internet where knowledge management was the major issue. The semantic web has a vision of linking, integrating and analysing data from various data sources and forming a new information stream, hence a web of databases connected with each other and machines interacting with other machines to yield results which are user oriented and accurate. With the emergence of Semantic Web framework the na "ive approach of searching information on the syntactic web is clich \'e. This paper proposes an optimised semantic searching of keywords exemplified by simulation an ontology of Indian universities with a proposed algorithm which ramifies the effective semantic retrieval of information which is easy to access and time saving.',

	{'abstract': u'We study spectra of directed networks with inhibitory and excitatory couplings. We investigate in particular eigenvector localization properties of various model networks for different value of correlation among their entries. Spectra of random networks, with completely uncorrelated entries show a circular distribution with delocalized eigenvectors, where as networks with correlated entries have localized eigenvectors. In order to understand the origin of localization we track the spectra as a function of connection probability and directionality. As connections are made directed, eigenstates start occurring in complex conjugate pairs and the eigenvalue distribution combined with the localization measure shows a rich pattern. Moreover, for a very well distinguished community structure, the whole spectrum is localized except few eigenstates at boundary of the circular distribution. As the network deviates from the community structure there is a sudden change in the localization property for a very small value of deformation from the perfect community structure. We search for this effect for the whole range of correlation strengths and for different community configurations. Furthermore, we investigate spectral properties of a metabolic network of zebrafish, and compare them with those of the model networks.',

	{'abstract': u'In information systems, a system is analyzed using a modeling tool. Analysis is an important phase prior to implementation in order to obtain the correct requirements of the system. During the requirements phase, the software requirements specification (SRS) is used to specify the system requirements. Then, this requirements specification is used to implement the system. The requirements specification can be represented using either a structure approach or an object-oriented approach. A UML (Unified Modeling Language) specification is a well-known for representation of requirements specification in an object-oriented approach. In this paper, we present one case study and discuss how mapping from UML specification into implementation is done. The case study does not require advanced programming skills. However, it does require familiarity in creating and instantiating classes, object-oriented programming with inheritance, data structure, file processing and control loop. For the case study, UML specification is used in requirements phase and Borland C++ is used in implementation phase. Based on the case study, it shows that the proposed approach improved the understanding of mapping from UML specification into implementation.',

	{'abstract': u'An algorithm is proposed for the segmentation of image into multiple levels using mean and standard deviation in the wavelet domain. The procedure provides for variable size segmentation with bigger block size around the mean, and having smaller blocks at the ends of histogram plot of each horizontal, vertical and diagonal components, while for the approximation component it provides for finer block size around the mean, and larger blocks at the ends of histogram plot coefficients. It is found that the proposed algorithm has significantly less time complexity, achieves superior PSNR and Structural Similarity Measurement Index as compared to similar space domain algorithms[1]. In the process it highlights finer image structures not perceptible in the original image. It is worth emphasizing that after the segmentation only 16 (at threshold level 3) wavelet coefficients captures the significant variation of image.',

A digital wallet is a software component that allows a user to make an electronic payment in cash (such as a credit card or a digital coin), and hides the low-level details of executing the payment protocol that is used to make the payment.

	{'abstract': u'It remains an open question whether the apparent additional power of quantum computation derives inherently from quantum mechanics, or merely from the flexibility obtained by "lifting" Boolean functions to linear operators and evaluating their composition cleverly. Holographic algorithms provide a useful avenue for exploring this question. We describe a new, simplified construction of holographic algorithms in terms of Pfaffian circuits. Novel proofs of some key results are provided, and we extend the approach of [34] to nonsymmetric, odd, and homogenized signatures, circuits, and various models of execution flow. This shows our approach is as powerful as the matchgate approach. Holographic algorithms provide in general time algorithms, where is the order of Pfaffian evaluation in the ring of interest (with depending on the ring) and is the number of inclusions of variables into clauses. Our approach often requires just the evaluation of an Pfaffian, and at most needs an additional two rows per gate, whereas the matchgate approach is quartic in the arity of the largest gate. We give examples (even before any change of basis) including efficient algorithms for certain lattice path problems and an algorithm for evaluation of Tutte polynomials of lattice path matroids. Finally we comment on some of the geometric considerations in analyzing Pfaffian circuits under arbitrary basis change. Connections are made to the sum-product algorithm, classical simulation of quantum computation, and SLOCC equivalent entangled states.',

	{'abstract': u'The Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) underpins the solution to many inverse problems commonly possessing missing or un-measured frequency information. This incomplete coverage of Fourier space always produces systematic artefacts called Ghosts. In this paper, a fast and exact method for de-convolving cyclic artefacts caused by missing slices of the DFT is presented. The slices discussed here originate from the exact partitioning of DFT space, under the projective Discrete Radon Transform, called the Discrete Fourier Slice Theorem. The method has a computational complexity of O(n log2 n) (where n = N^2) and is constructed from a new Finite Ghost theory. This theory is also shown to unify several aspects of work done on Ghosts over the past three decades. The paper concludes with a significant application to fast, exact, non-iterative image reconstruction from sets of discrete slices obtained for a limited range of projection angles.',

	{'abstract': u"In this paper, we introduce the concept of dual universality of hash functions and present its applications to quantum cryptography. We begin by establishing the one-to-one correspondence between a linear function family and a code family , and thereby defining varepsilon-almost dual universal_2 hash functions, as a generalization of the conventional universal_2 hash functions. Then we show that this generalized (and thus broader) class of hash functions is in fact sufficient for the security of quantum cryptography. This result can be explained in two different formalisms. First, by noting its relation to the delta-biased family introduced by Dodis and Smith, we demonstrate that Renner's two-universal hashing lemma is generalized to our class of hash functions. Next, we prove that the proof technique by Shor and Preskill can be applied to quantum key distribution (QKD) systems that use our generalized class of hash functions for privacy amplification. While Shor-Preskill formalism requires an implementer of a QKD system to explicitly construct a linear code of the Calderbank-Shor-Steane type, this result removes the existing difficulty of the construction a linear code of CSS code by replacing it by the combination of an ordinary classical error correcting code and our proposed hash function. We also show that a similar result applies to the quantum wire-tap channel. Finally we compare our results in the two formalisms and show that, in typical QKD scenarios, the Shor-Preskill--type argument gives better security bounds in terms of the trace distance and Holevo information, than the method based on the delta-biased family.",

	{'abstract': u'In a landmark paper, Papadimitriou and Roughgarden described a polynomial-time algorithm ("Ellipsoid Against Hope") for computing sample correlated equilibria of concisely-represented games. Recently, Stein, Parrilo and Ozdaglar showed that this algorithm can fail to find an exact correlated equilibrium, but can be easily modified to efficiently compute approximate correlated equilibria. Currently, it remains unresolved whether the algorithm can be modified to compute an exact correlated equilibrium. We show that it can, presenting a variant of the Ellipsoid Against Hope algorithm that guarantees the polynomial-time identification of exact correlated equilibrium. Our new algorithm differs from the original primarily in its use of a separation oracle that produces cuts corresponding to pure-strategy profiles. As a result, we no longer face the numerical precision issues encountered by the original approach, and both the resulting algorithm and its analysis are considerably simplified. Our new separation oracle can be understood as a derandomization of Papadimitriou and Roughgarden\'s original separation oracle via the method of conditional probabilities. Also, the equilibria returned by our algorithm are distributions with polynomial-sized supports, which are simpler (in the sense of being representable in fewer bits) than the mixtures of product distributions produced previously; no tractable algorithm has previously been proposed for identifying such equilibria.',

	{'abstract': u"Solving mazes is not just a fun pastime. Mazes are prototype models in graph theory, topology, robotics, traffic optimization, psychology, and in many other areas of science and technology. However, when maze complexity increases their solution becomes cumbersome and very time consuming. Here, we show that a network of memristors - resistors with memory - can solve such a non-trivial problem quite easily. In particular, maze solving by the network of memristors occurs in a massively parallel fashion since all memristors in the network participate simultaneously in the calculation. The result of the calculation is then recorded into the memristors' states, and can be used and/or recovered at a later time. Furthermore, the network of memristors finds all possible solutions in multiple-solution mazes, and sorts out the solution paths according to their length. Our results demonstrate not only the first application of memristive networks to the field of massively-parallel computing, but also a novel algorithm to solve mazes which could find applications in different research fields.",

The algorithm, although not exact (it could produce false positives) has two very important features: (i) it has polynomial complexity and (ii) for every "NO" answer, a "short" proof is generated, which is of much interest since 3-colorability is a NP-complete problem and thus its complementary problem is in Co-NP. Hence the algorithm is exact when it determines that a given planar graph is not 3-colorable since this is verifiable via an automatic generation of short formal proofs (also human-readable).',

	{'abstract': u'We study Bayesian mechanism design problems in settings where agents have budgets. Specifically, an agent\'s utility for an outcome is given by his value for the outcome minus any payment he makes to the mechanism, as long as the payment is below his budget, and is negative infinity otherwise. This discontinuity in the utility function presents a significant challenge in the design of good mechanisms, and classical "unconstrained" mechanisms fail to work in settings with budgets. The goal of this paper is to develop general reductions from budget-constrained Bayesian MD to unconstrained Bayesian MD with small loss in performance. We consider this question in the context of the two most well-studied objectives in mechanism design---social welfare and revenue---and present constant factor approximations in a number of settings. Some of our results extend to settings where budgets are private and agents need to be incentivized to reveal them truthfully.',

	{'abstract': u'Histograms are widely used in medical imaging, network intrusion detection, packet analysis and other stream-based high throughput applications. However, while porting such software stacks to the GPU, the computation of the histogram is a typical bottleneck primarily due to the large impact on kernel speed by atomic operations. In this work, we propose a stream-based model implemented in CUDA, using a new adaptive kernel that can be optimized based on latency hidden CPU compute. We also explore the tradeoffs of using the new kernel vis- `a-vis the stock NVIDIA SDK kernel, and discuss an intelligent kernel switching method for the stream based on a degeneracy criterion that is adaptively computed from the input stream.',

	{'abstract': u'We propose an efficient Adaptive Random Convolutional Network Coding (ARCNC) algorithm to address the issue of field size in random network coding. ARCNC operates as a convolutional code, with the coefficients of local encoding kernels chosen randomly over a small finite field. The lengths of local encoding kernels increase with time until the global encoding kernel matrices at related sink nodes all have full rank. Instead of estimating the necessary field size a priori, ARCNC operates in a small finite field. It adapts to unknown network topologies without prior knowledge, by locally incrementing the dimensionality of the convolutional code. Because convolutional codes of different constraint lengths can coexist in different portions of the network, reductions in decoding delay and memory overheads can be achieved with ARCNC. We show through analysis that this method performs no worse than random linear network codes in general networks, and can provide significant gains in terms of average decoding delay in combination networks.',

Early work has shown that consistency checking of complete networks of basic CDC constraints is tractable while reasoning with the CDC in general is NP-hard. This paper shows, however, if allowing some constraints unspecified, then consistency checking of possibly incomplete networks of basic CDC constraints is already intractable. This draws a sharp boundary between the tractable and intractable subclasses of the CDC. The result is achieved by a reduction from the well-known 3-SAT problem.',

	{'abstract': u'In this work, we study the problem of power allocation in teams. Each team consists of two agents who try to split their available power between the tasks of communication and jamming the nodes of the other team. The agents have constraints on their total energy and instantaneous power usage. The cost function is the difference between the rates of erroneously transmitted bits of each team. We model the problem as a zero-sum differential game between the two teams and use approach to obtain the necessary conditions for the optimal trajectories. This leads to a continuous-kernel power allocation game among the players. Based on the communications model, we present sufficient conditions on the physical parameters of the agents for the existence of a pure strategy Nash equilibrium (PSNE). Finally, we present simulation results for the case when the agents are holonomic.',

Towards obtaining maximum performance, one of the holy grails of logic programming has been to design computational models that could be executed efficiently and that would allow both for a reduction of the search space and for exploiting all the available parallelism in the application. These goals have motivated the design of the Extended Andorra Model, a model where goals that do not constrain non-deterministic goals can execute first. In this work we present and evaluate the Basic design for Extended Andorra Model (BEAM), a system that builds upon David H. D. Warren's original EAM with Implicit Control. We provide a complete description and implementation of the BEAM System as a set of rewrite and control rules. We present the major data structures and execution algorithms that are required for efficient execution, and evaluate system performance. A detailed performance study of our system is included. Our results show that the system achieves acceptable base performance, and that a number of applications benefit from the advanced search inherent to the EAM.",

However, the extent of these effects has yet to be explored, and formally presented. In this paper, I empirically investigate this dependence for seven distributions and fifteen recovery algorithms. The two morals of this work are: 1) any judgement of the recovery performance of one algorithm over that of another must be prefaced by the conditions for which this is observed to be true, including sparse vector distributions, and the criterion for exact recovery; and 2) a recovery algorithm must be selected carefully based on what distribution one expects to underlie the sensed sparse signal.',

	{'abstract': u'Deterministic graph grammars generate regular graphs, that form a structural extension of configuration graphs of pushdown systems. In this paper, we study a probabilistic extension of regular graphs obtained by labelling the terminal arcs of the graph grammars by probabilities. Stochastic properties of these graphs are expressed using PCTL, a probabilistic extension of computation tree logic. We present here an algorithm to perform approximate verification of PCTL formulae. Moreover, we prove that the exact model-checking problem for PCTL on probabilistic regular graphs is undecidable, unless restricting to qualitative properties. Our results generalise those of EKM06, on probabilistic pushdown automata, using similar methods combined with graph grammars techniques.',

	{'abstract': u'We present and discuss the results of an experimental analysis in the design of Boolean networks by means of genetic algorithms. A population of networks is evolved with the aim of finding a network such that the attractor it reaches is of required length . In general, any target can be defined, provided that it is possible to model the task as an optimisation problem over the space of networks. We experiment with different initial conditions for the networks, namely in ordered, chaotic and critical regions, and also with different target length values. Results show that all kinds of initial networks can attain the desired goal, but with different success ratios: initial populations composed of critical or chaotic networks are more likely to reach the target. Moreover, the evolution starting from critical networks achieves the best overall performance. This study is the first step toward the use of search algorithms as tools for automatically design Boolean networks with required properties.',

	{'abstract': u'Most work on wireless network throughput ignores the temporal correlation inherent to wireless channels because it degrades tractability. To better model and quantify the temporal variations of wireless network throughput, this paper introduces a metric termed ergodic transmission capacity (ETC), which includes spatial and temporal ergodicity. All transmitters in the network form a homogeneous Poisson point process and all channels are modeled by a finite state Markov chain. The bounds on outage probability and ETC are characterized, and their scaling behaviors for a sparse and dense network are discussed. From these results, we show that the ETC can be characterized by the inner product of the channel-state related vector and the invariant probability vector of the Markov chain. This indicates that channel-aware opportunistic transmission does not always increase ETC. Finally, we look at outage probability with interference management from a stochastic geometry point of view. The improved bounds on outage probability and ETC due to interference management are characterized and they provide some useful insights on how to effectively manage interference in sparse and dense networks.',

	{'abstract': u'In this paper, we tackle the problem of opportunistic spectrum access in large-scale cognitive radio networks, where the unlicensed Secondary Users (SU) access the frequency channels partially occupied by the licensed Primary Users (PU). Each channel is characterized by an availability probability unknown to the SUs. We apply evolutionary game theory to model the spectrum access problem and develop distributed spectrum access policies based on imitation, a behavior rule widely applied in human societies consisting of imitating successful behavior. We first develop two imitation-based spectrum access policies based on the basic Proportional Imitation (PI) rule and the more advanced Double Imitation (DI) rule given that a SU can imitate any other SUs. We then adapt the proposed policies to a more practical scenario where a SU can only imitate the other SUs operating on the same channel. A systematic theoretical analysis is presented for both scenarios on the induced imitation dynamics and the convergence properties of the proposed policies to an imitation-stable equilibrium, which is also the -optimum of the system. Simple, natural and incentive-compatible, the proposed imitation-based spectrum access policies can be implemented distributedly based on solely local interactions and thus is especially suited in decentralized adaptive learning environments as cognitive radio networks.',

Our approach involves reducing the problem to that of finding a shortest odd cycle of length in a graph. Our algorithm runs in time, improving upon Shrem, Stern, and Golumbic's recent algorithm, which uses a local approach.

The language is a graphical variant of the Pi-calculus with iterators to express non-terminating behaviors. The operational semantics of Pi-graphs use ground notions of labelled transition and bisimulation, which means standard verification techniques can be applied. We show that bisimilarity is decidable for the proposed semantics, a result obtained thanks to an original notion of causal clock as well as the automatic garbage collection of unused names.',

	{'abstract': u'Vulnerabilities related to weak passwords are a pressing global economic and security issue. We report a novel, simple, and effective approach to address the weak password problem. Building upon chaotic dynamics, criticality at phase transitions, CAPTCHA recognition, and computational round-off errors we design an algorithm that strengthens security of passwords. The core idea of our method is to split a long and secure password into two components. The first component is memorized by the user. The second component is transformed into a CAPTCHA image and then protected using evolution of a two-dimensional dynamical system close to a phase transition, in such a way that standard brute-force attacks become ineffective. We expect our approach to have wide applications for authentication and encryption technologies.',

Furthermore, they have been recently proposed also as a source of design principles and guidelines. Boolean networks are a prominent example of complex dynamical systems and they have been shown to effectively capture important phenomena in gene regulation.

	{'abstract': u'Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithms (MOEAs) have been proved efficient to deal with Multi-objective Optimization Problems (MOPs). Until now tens of MOEAs have been proposed. The unified mode would provide a more systematic approach to build new MOEAs. Here a new model is proposed which includes two sub-models based on two classes of different schemas of MOEAs. According to the new model, some representatives algorithms are decomposed and some interesting issues are discussed.',

	{'abstract': u"Numerous properties of vector addition systems with states amount to checking the (un)boundedness of some selective feature (e.g., number of reversals, run length). Some of these features can be checked in exponential space by using Rackoff's proof or its variants, combined with Savitch's theorem. However, the question is still open for many others, e.g., reversal-boundedness. In the paper, we introduce the class of generalized unboundedness properties that can be verified in exponential space by extending Rackoff's technique, sometimes in an unorthodox way. We obtain new optimal upper bounds, for example for place-boundedness problem, reversal-boundedness detection (several variants exist), strong promptness detection problem and regularity detection. Our analysis is sufficiently refined so as we also obtain a polynomial-space bound when the dimension is fixed.",

	{'abstract': u'Irregular low-density parity check (LDPC) codes are particularly well-suited for transmission schemes that require unequal error protection (UEP) of the transmitted data due to the different connection degrees of its variable nodes. However, this UEP capability is strongly dependent on the connection profile among the protection classes. This paper applies a multi-edge type analysis of LDPC codes for optimizing such connection profile according to the performance requirements of each protection class. This allows the construction of UEP-LDPC codes where the difference between the performance of the protection classes can be adjusted and with an UEP capability that does not vanish as the number of decoding iterations grows.',

In this paper, we consider the problem of puncturing low-density parity-check codes and propose a new algorithm for intentional puncturing.

It is shown that the algorithm proposed here performs better than previous proposals for a range of coding rates and short proportions of punctured symbols.',

	{'abstract': u'We study a hypothesis testing problem in which data is compressed distributively and sent to a detector that seeks to decide between two possible distributions for the data. The aim is to characterize all achievable encoding rates and exponents of the type 2 error probability when the type 1 error probability is at most a fixed value. For related problems in distributed source coding, schemes based on random binning perform well and often optimal. For distributed hypothesis testing, however, the use of binning is hindered by the fact that the overall error probability may be dominated by errors in binning process. We show that despite this complication, binning is optimal for a class of problems in which the goal is to "test against conditional independence." We then use this optimality result to give an outer bound for a more general class of instances of the problem.',

	{'abstract': u'The memory consistency model is a fundamental system property characterizing a multiprocessor. The relative merits of strict versus relaxed memory models have been widely debated in terms of their impact on performance, hardware complexity and programmability. This paper adds a new dimension to this discussion: the impact of memory models on software reliability. By allowing some instructions to reorder, weak memory models may expand the window between critical memory operations. This can increase the chance of an undesirable thread-interleaving, thus allowing an otherwise-unlikely concurrency bug to manifest. To explore this phenomenon, we define and study a probabilistic model of shared-memory parallel programs that takes into account such reordering. We use this model to formally derive bounds on the emph to concurrency bugs of different memory models. Our results show that for 2 (or a small constant number of) concurrent threads, weaker memory models do indeed have a higher likelihood of allowing bugs. On the other hand, we show that as the number of parallel threads increases, the gap between the different memory models becomes proportionally insignificant. This suggests the counter-intuitive rule that emph; which potentially has major implications on the choice of memory consistency models in future multi-core systems.',

	{'abstract': u'On the Internet large service providers tend to control the digital identities of users. These defacto identity authorities wield significant power over users, compelling them to comply with non-negotiable terms, before access to services is granted. In doing so, users expose themselves to privacy risks, manipulation and exploitation via direct marketing. Against this backdrop, the emerging areas of Digital Ecosystems and user-centric identity emphasise decentralised environments with independent self-determining entities that control their own data and identity. We show that recent advances in user-centric identity, federated identity and trust have prepared the ground for decentralised identity provisioning. We show how social trust, rather than blind deference to authorities, can provide a basis for identity, where risks can be weighed and compared rather than merely accepted. Fundamentally, we are considering the move from authority-centric centralised identity provisioning to user-centric distributed identity provisioning. Finally, we highlight the potential impacts of distributed identity provisioning in the Information Society and give a brief roadmap for its general implementation and adoption.',

	{'abstract': u'Preferential attachment is the most popular explanation for the emergence of scaling behavior in the World Wide Web, but this explanation has been challenged by the global information hypothesis, the existence of linear preference and the emergence of new big internet companies in the real world. We notice that most websites have an obvious feature that their pages are organized as a tree (namely hidden tree) and hence propose a new model that introduces a hidden tree structure into the Erd Hs-R \'eyi model by adding a new rule: when one node connects to another, it should also connect to all nodes in the path between these two nodes in the hidden tree. The experimental results show that the degree distribution of the generated graphs would obey power law distributions and have variable high clustering coefficients and variable small average lengths of shortest paths. The proposed model provides an alternative explanation to the emergence of scaling in the World Wide Web without the above-mentioned difficulties, and also explains the "preferential attachment" phenomenon.',

AutoAnalyzer is unique in terms of two features: first, without any apriori knowledge, it automatically locates bottlenecks and uncovers their root causes for performance optimization; second, it is lightweight in terms of the size of performance data to be collected and analyzed. Our contributions are three-fold: first, we propose two effective clustering algorithms to investigate the existence of performance bottlenecks that cause process behavior dissimilarity or code region behavior disparity, respectively; meanwhile, we present two searching algorithms to locate bottlenecks; second, on a basis of the rough set theory, we propose an innovative approach to automatically uncovering root causes of bottlenecks; third, on the cluster systems with two different configurations, we use two production applications, written in Fortran 77, and one open source code-MPIBZIP2 (this http URL), written in C++, to verify the effectiveness and correctness of our methods. For three applications, we also propose an experimental approach to investigating the effects of different metrics on locating bottlenecks.',

	{'abstract': u'In this paper, we consider weighted nonbinary repeat multiple-accumulate (WNRMA) code ensembles obtained from the serial concatenation of a nonbinary rate-1/n repeat code and the cascade of L&gt;= 1 accumulators, where each encoder is followed by a nonbinary random weighter. The WNRMA codes are assumed to be iteratively decoded using the turbo principle with maximum a posteriori constituent decoders. We derive the exact weight enumerator of nonbinary accumulators and subsequently give the weight enumerators for WNRMA code ensembles. We formally prove that the symbol-wise minimum distance of WNRMA code ensembles asymptotically grows linearly with the block length when L &gt;= 3 and n &gt;= 2, and L=2 and n &gt;= 3, for all powers of primes q &gt;= 3 considered, where q is the field size. Thus, WNRMA code ensembles are asymptotically good for these parameters. We also give iterative decoding thresholds, computed by an extrinsic information transfer chart analysis, on the q-ary symmetric channel to show the convergence properties. Finally, we consider the binary image of WNRMA code ensembles and compare the asymptotic minimum distance growth rates with those of binary repeat multiple-accumulate code ensembles.',

	{'abstract': u"In the article a turn-based game played on four computers connected via network is investigated. There are three computers with natural intelligence and one with artificial intelligence. Game table is seen by each player's own view point in all players' monitors. Domino pieces are three dimensional. For distributed systems TCP/IP protocol is used. In order to get 3D image, Microsoft XNA technology is applied. Domino 101 game is nondeterministic game that is result of the game depends on the initial random distribution of the pieces. Number of the distributions is equal to the multiplication of following combinations: . Moreover, in this game that is played by four people, players are divided into 2 pairs. Accordingly, we cannot predict how the player uses the dominoes that is according to the dominoes of his/her partner or according to his/her own dominoes. The fact that the natural intelligence can be a player in any level affects the outcome. These reasons make it difficult to develop an AI. In the article four levels of AI are developed. The AI in the first level is equivalent to the intelligence of a child who knows the rules of the game and recognizes the numbers. The AI in this level plays if it has any domino, suitable to play or says pass. In most of the games which can be played on the internet, the AI does the same. But the AI in the last level is a master player, and it can develop itself according to its competitors' levels.",

	{'abstract': u'Since the birth of software engineering, it always are recognized as one pure engineering subject, therefore, the foundational scientific problems are not paid much attention. This paper proposes that Requirements Analysis, the kernel process of software engineering, can be modeled based on the concept of "common knowledge". Such a model would make us understand the nature of this process. This paper utilizes the formal language as the tool to characterize the "common knowledge"-based Requirements Analysis model, and theoretically proves that : 1) the precondition of success of software projects regardless of cost would be that the participants in a software project have fully known the requirement specification, if the participants do not understand the meaning of the other participants; 2) the precondition of success of software projects regardless of cost would be that the union set of knowledge of basic facts of the participants in a software project can fully cover the requirement specification, if the participants can always understand the meaning of the other participants. These two theorems may have potential meanings to propose new software engineering methodology.',

	{'abstract': u'We explore the interplay between interference, cooperation and connectivity in heterogeneous wireless interference networks. Specifically, we consider a 4-user locally-connected interference network with pairwise clustered decoding and show that its degrees of freedom (DoF) are bounded above by 12/5. Interestingly, when compared to the corresponding fully connected setting which is known to have 8/3 DoF, the locally connected network is only missing interference-carrying links, but still has lower DoF, i.e., eliminating these interference-carrying links reduces the DoF. The 12/5 DoF outer bound is obtained through a novel approach that translates insights from interference alignment over linear vector spaces into corresponding sub-modularity relationships between entropy functions.',

	{'abstract': u'Dynamic graphs have emerged as an appropriate model to capture the changing nature of many modern networks, such as peer-to-peer overlays and mobile ad hoc networks. Most of the recent research on dynamic networks has only addressed the undirected dynamic graph model. However, realistic networks such as the ones identified above are directed. In this paper we present early work in addressing the properties of directed dynamic graphs. In particular, we explore the problem of random walk in such graphs. We assume the existence of an oblivious adversary that makes arbitrary changes in every communication round. We explore the problem of covering the dynamic graph, that even in the static case can be exponential, and we establish an upper bound O(d_max n^3 log^2 n) of the cover time for balanced dynamic graphs.',

	{'abstract': u'The fundamental matrix and trifocal tensor are convenient algebraic representations of the epipolar geometry of two and three view configurations, respectively. The estimation of these entities is central to most reconstruction algorithms, and a solid understanding of their properties and constraints is therefore very important. The fundamental matrix has 1 internal constraint which is well understood, whereas the trifocal tensor has 8 independent algebraic constraints. The internal tensor constraints can be represented in many ways, although there is only one minimal and sufficient set of 8 constraints known. In this paper, we derive a second set of minimal and sufficient constraints that is simpler. We also show how this can be used in a new parameterization of the trifocal tensor. We hope that this increased understanding of the internal constraints may lead to improved algorithms for estimating the trifocal tensor, although the primary contribution is an improved theoretical understanding.',

	{'abstract': u'Sand pile models are dynamical systems emphasizing the phenomenon of Self Organized Criticality (SOC). From N stacked grains, iterating evolution rules leads to some critical configuration where a small disturbance has deep consequences on the system, involving numerous steps of grain fall. Physicists L. Kadanoff et al. inspire KSPM, a model presenting a sharp SOC behavior, extending the well known Sand Pile Model. In KSPM with parameter D we start from a pile of N stacked grains and apply the rule: D-1 grains can fall from column i onto the D-1 adjacent columns to the right if the difference of height between columns i and i+1 is greater or equal to D. We propose an iterative study of KSPM evolution where one single grain addition is repeated on a heap of sand. The sequence of grain falls following a single grain addition is called an avalanche. From a certain column precisely studied for D=3, we provide a plain process describing avalanches.',

A stream of packets, each attributed with a value representing its Class of Service (CoS), arrives over time at a network switch and demands a further transmission. The switch is equipped with multiple queues of limited capacities, where each queue stores packets of one value only. The objective is to maximize the total value of the transmitted packets (i.e., the weighted throughput). We analyze a natural greedy algorithm, GREEDY, which sends in each time step a packet with the greatest value. For general packet values , we show that GREEDY is -competitive, where .

One can find many ad-hoc embeddings of one of these models into the other. We build upon the seminal work of De Nicola and Vaandrager that firmly established the correspondence between stuttering equivalence in Kripke Structures and divergence-sensitive branching bisimulation in Labelled Transition Systems. We show that their embeddings can also be used for a range of other equivalences of interest, such as strong bisimilarity, simulation equivalence, and trace equivalence. Furthermore, we extend the results by De Nicola and Vaandrager by showing that there are additional translations that allow one to use minimisation techniques in one semantic domain to obtain minimal representatives in the other semantic domain for these equivalences.',

Current criteria to assess different models of a network mainly rely on how close a model matches the network in terms of topological characteristics. Typical topological metrics are clustering coefficient, distance distribution, the largest eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix, and the gap between the first and the second largest eigenvalues, which are widely used to evaluate and compare different models of a network. In this paper, we show that evaluating complex network models based on the current topological metrics can be quite misleading. Taking several models of the AS-level Internet as examples, we show that although a model seems to be good to describe the Internet in terms of the aforementioned topological characteristics, it is far from being realistic to represent the real Internet in performances such as robustness in resisting intentional attacks and traffic load distributions. We further show that it is not useful to assess network models by examining some topological characteristics such as clustering coefficient and distance distribution, if robustness of the Internet against random node removals is the only concern. Our findings shed new lights on how to reasonably evaluate different models of a network, not only the Internet but also other types of complex networks.',

	{'abstract': u'The has been modeled as the spread of an information within a group through a process of social influence, where the diffusion is driven by the so called . Such a process, which has been intensively studied under the name of , has the goal to select an initial good set of individuals that will promote a new idea (or message) by spreading the "rumor" within the entire social network through the word-of-mouth. Several studies used the where the group is represented by a graph, nodes have two possible states (active, non-active), and the threshold triggering the adoption (activation) of a new idea to a node is given by the number of the active neighbors. The problem of detecting in a graph the presence of the minimal number of nodes that will be able to activate the entire network is called (TSS). In this paper we extend TSS by allowing nodes to have more than two colors. The multicolored version of the TSS can be described as follows: let be a torus where every node is assigned a color from a finite set of colors. At each local time step, each node can recolor itself, depending on the local configurations, with the color held by the majority of its neighbors. We study the initial distributions of colors leading the system to a monochromatic configuration of color , focusing on the minimum number of initial -colored nodes. We conclude the paper by providing the time complexity to achieve the monochromatic configuration.',

Although computing the minimum number of moves required to flood an arbitrary graph is known to be NP-hard, we demonstrate a polynomial time algorithm to compute the minimum number of moves required to link each pair of vertices. We apply this result to compute in polynomial time the minimum number of moves required to flood a path, and an additive approximation to this quantity for an arbitrary k x n board, coloured with a bounded number of colours, for any fixed k.

	{'abstract': u'Several emerging classes of applications that run over wireless networks have a need for mathematical models and tools to systematically characterize the reliability of the network. We propose two metrics for measuring the reliability of wireless mesh routing topologies, one for flooding and one for unicast routing. The Flooding Path Probability (FPP) metric measures the end-to-end packet delivery probability when each node broadcasts a packet after hearing from all its upstream neighbors. The Unicast Retransmission Flow (URF) metric measures the end-to-end packet delivery probability when a relay node retransmits a unicast packet on its outgoing links until it receives an acknowledgement or it tries all the links. Both metrics rely on specific packet forwarding models, rather than heuristics, to derive explicit expressions of the end-to-end packet delivery probability from individual link probabilities and the underlying connectivity graph. We also propose a distributed, greedy algorithm that uses the URF metric to construct a reliable routing topology. This algorithm constructs a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) from a weighted, undirected connectivity graph, where each link is weighted by its success probability. The algorithm uses a vector of decreasing reliability thresholds to coordinate when nodes can join the routing topology. Simulations demonstrate that, on average, this algorithm constructs a more reliable topology than the usual minimum hop DAG.',

Assume that the error-trellis can be reduced using shifted error-subsequences. In this case, if the identical shifts occur in the subsequences of each code path, then the code-trellis can also be reduced. First, we obtain pairs of transformations which generate the identical shifts both in the subsequences of the code-path and in those of the error-path. Next, by applying these transformations to the generator matrix and the parity-check matrix, we show that reduction of these matrices is accomplished simultaneously, if it is possible.

	{'abstract': u'A well-known problem in Petri net theory is to formalise an appropriate causality-based concept of process or run for place/transition systems. The so-called individual token interpretation, where tokens are distinguished according to their causal history, giving rise to the processes of Goltz and Reisig, is often considered too detailed. The problem of defining a fully satisfying more abstract concept of process for general place/transition systems has so-far not been solved. In this paper, we recall the proposal of defining an abstract notion of process, here called BD-process, in terms of equivalence classes of Goltz-Reisig processes, using an equivalence proposed by Best and Devillers. It yields a fully satisfying solution for at least all one-safe nets. However, for certain nets which intuitively have different conflicting behaviours, it yields only one maximal abstract process. Here we identify a class of place/transition systems, called structural conflict nets, where conflict and concurrency due to token multiplicity are clearly separated. We show that, in the case of structural conflict nets, the equivalence proposed by Best and Devillers yields a unique maximal abstract process only for conflict-free nets. Thereby BD-processes constitute a simple and fully satisfying solution in the class of structural conflict nets.',

Because the conditional independencies between different nodes correspond to zero entries in the inverse covariance matrix of the Gaussian distribution, one can learn the structure of the graph by estimating a sparse inverse covariance matrix from sample data, by solving a convex maximum likelihood problem with an -regularization term. In this paper, we propose a first-order method based on an alternating linearization technique that exploits the problem's special structure; in particular, the subproblems solved in each iteration have closed-form solutions. Moreover, our algorithm obtains an -optimal solution in iterations.

The problem is solved by obtaining winning strategies in concurrent two-player emph with safety objectives. To prevent a player from winning by blocking time, we restrict each player to strategies that ensure that the player cannot be responsible for causing a zeno run. We construct winning strategies for the controller which require access only to (1) the system clocks (thus, controllers which require their own internal infinitely precise clocks are not necessary), and (2) a linear (in the number of clocks) number of memory bits. Precisely, we show that a memory of size bits suffices for winning controller strategies for safety objectives, where is the set of clocks of the timed automaton game, significantly improving the previous known exponential bound. We also settle the open question of whether emph strategies for controllers require memory for safety objectives by showing with an example that region strategies do require memory for safety objectives.',

Language Oriented Programming (LOP) is a software development paradigm that aims to close this gap, through extensive use of Domain Specific Languages (DSLs). With LOP, the high-level reusable concepts become reusable DSL constructs, and their translation into code level concepts is done in the DSL implementation. Particular products are implemented using DSL code, thus reusing only high-level concepts. In this paper we provide a comparison between two implementation approaches for LOP: (a) using external DSLs with a projectional language workbench (MPS); and (b) using internal DSLs with an LOP language (Cedalion). To demonstrate how reuse is achieved in each approach, we present a small case study, where LOP is used to build a Software Product Line (SPL) of calculator software.',

Most quantization methods are essentially based on data clustering algorithms. However, despite its popularity as a general purpose clustering algorithm, k-means has not received much respect in the color quantization literature because of its high computational requirements and sensitivity to initialization. In this paper, a fast color quantization method based on k-means is presented. The method involves several modifications to the conventional (batch) k-means algorithm including data reduction, sample weighting, and the use of triangle inequality to speed up the nearest neighbor search. Experiments on a diverse set of images demonstrate that, with the proposed modifications, k-means becomes very competitive with state-of-the-art color quantization methods in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency.',

	{'abstract': u'Now a day\'s many organizations are required to communicate online on a daily basis, 24-hour, seven-days-a-week, to gain the desired competitive advantages and profits; although there are a variety of disruptions that may occur within business application such as broken (off-line) database-links and unhanded database exceptions. Such cases will end the automated business work, and force business users to continue business procedures and functionalities via paper work, which causes additional resources with less business competitive advantages. In this paper, we will propose a new model in which we embed short message services (SMS) within business applications using the SMS Gateway such as "Ozeki Message Server", and programmed application packages. By using our proposed model, we can maintain business continuity when a partial disruption occurs and then switch to our application model. As a result to the experimental work, we conclude that our model supports business continuity since it supports the account balance modification while the database link is disrupted. In addition, we carried out each step twice and the scenario was reliable since all of its steps were reliable.',

	{'abstract': u'The 4th Workshop on Membrane Computing and Biologically Inspired Process Calculi (MeCBIC 2010) is organized in Jena as a satellite event of the Eleventh International Conference on Membrane Computing (CMC11). Biological membranes play a fundamental role in the complex reactions which take place in cells of living organisms. The importance of this role has been considered in two different types of formalisms introduced recently. Membrane systems were introduced as a class of distributed parallel computing devices inspired by the observation that any biological system is a complex hierarchical structure, with a flow of biochemical substances and information that underlies their functioning. The modeling and analysis of biological systems has also attracted considerable interest of the process algebra research community. Thus the notions of membranes and compartments have been explicitly represented in a family of calculi, such as ambients and brane calculi. A cross fertilization of these two research areas has recently started. A deeper investigation of the relationships between these related formalisms is interesting, as it is important to understand the crucial similarities and the differences. The main aim of the workshop is to bring together researchers working on membrane computing, in biologically inspired process calculi, and in other related fields, in order to present recent results and to discuss new ideas concerning such formalisms, their properties and relationships.',

	{'abstract': u"The degrees of freedom (DoF) region of the 2-user multiple-antenna or MIMO (multiple-input, multiple-output) interference channel (IC) is studied under fast fading and the assumption of channel state information (CSI) wherein all terminals know all (or certain) channel matrices perfectly, but with a delay, and each receiver in addition knows its own incoming channels instantaneously. The general MIMO IC is considered with an arbitrary number of antennas at each of the four terminals. Dividing it into several classes depending on the relation between the numbers of antennas at the four terminals, the fundamental DoF regions are characterized under the delayed CSI assumption for possible values of number of antennas at the four terminals. In particular, an outer bound on the DoF region of the general MIMO IC is derived. This bound is then shown to be tight for all MIMO ICs by developing interference alignment based achievability schemes for each class. A comparison of these DoF regions under the delayed CSI assumption is made with those of the idealistic `perfect CSI' assumption where perfect and instantaneous CSI is available at all terminals on the one hand and with the DoF regions of the conservative `no CSI' assumption on the other, where CSI is available at the receivers but not at all at the transmitters.",

	{'abstract': u'Discontinuity preserving smoothing is a fundamentally important procedure that is useful in a wide variety of image processing contexts. It is directly useful for noise reduction, and frequently used as an intermediate step in higher level algorithms. For example, it can be particularly useful in edge detection and segmentation. Three well known algorithms for discontinuity preserving smoothing are nonlinear anisotropic diffusion, bilateral filtering, and mean shift filtering. Although slight differences make them each better suited to different tasks, all are designed to preserve discontinuities while smoothing. However, none of them satisfy this goal perfectly: they each have exception cases in which smoothing may occur across hard edges. The principal contribution of this paper is the identification of a property we call edge awareness that should be satisfied by any discontinuity preserving smoothing algorithm. This constraint can be incorporated into existing algorithms to improve quality, and usually has negligible changes in runtime performance and/or complexity. We present modifications necessary to augment diffusion and mean shift, as well as a new formulation of the bilateral filter that unifies the spatial and range spaces to achieve edge awareness.',

	{'abstract': u'We develop a novel method, based on the statistical concept of the Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension, to evaluate the selectivity (output cardinality) of SQL queries - a crucial step in optimizing the execution of large scale database and data-mining operations. The major theoretical contribution of this work, which is of independent interest, is an explicit bound to the VC-dimension of a range space defined by all possible outcomes of a collection (class) of queries. We prove that the VC-dimension is a function of the maximum number of Boolean operations in the selection predicate and of the maximum number of select and join operations in any individual query in the collection, but it is neither a function of the number of queries in the collection nor of the size (number of tuples) of the database. We leverage on this result and develop a method that, given a class of queries, builds a concise random sample of a database, such that with high probability the execution of any query in the class on the sample provides an accurate estimate for the selectivity of the query on the original large database. The error probability holds simultaneously for the selectivity estimates of all queries in the collection, thus the same sample can be used to evaluate the selectivity of multiple queries, and the sample needs to be refreshed only following major changes in the database. The sample representation computed by our method is typically sufficiently small to be stored in main memory. We present extensive experimental results, validating our theoretical analysis and demonstrating the advantage of our technique when compared to complex selectivity estimation techniques used in PostgreSQL and the Microsoft SQL Server.',

	{'abstract': u'We propose a new approach to value function approximation which combines linear temporal difference reinforcement learning with subspace identification. In practical applications, reinforcement learning (RL) is complicated by the fact that state is either high-dimensional or partially observable. Therefore, RL methods are designed to work with features of state rather than state itself, and the success or failure of learning is often determined by the suitability of the selected features. By comparison, subspace identification (SSID) methods are designed to select a feature set which preserves as much information as possible about state. In this paper we connect the two approaches, looking at the problem of reinforcement learning with a large set of features, each of which may only be marginally useful for value function approximation. We introduce a new algorithm for this situation, called Predictive State Temporal Difference (PSTD) learning. As in SSID for predictive state representations, PSTD finds a linear compression operator that projects a large set of features down to a small set that preserves the maximum amount of predictive information. As in RL, PSTD then uses a Bellman recursion to estimate a value function. We discuss the connection between PSTD and prior approaches in RL and SSID. We prove that PSTD is statistically consistent, perform several experiments that illustrate its properties, and demonstrate its potential on a difficult optimal stopping problem.',

Time is slotted and users arrive and depart upon service completion. This may model for example the flow-level behavior of end-users in a narrowband HDR wireless channel (CDMA 1xEV-DO). As performance criteria we consider the stability of the system and the mean delay experienced by the users. Given the complexity of the problem we investigate the fluid-scaled system, which allows to obtain important results and insights for the original system: (1) We characterize for a large class of scheduling policies the stability conditions and identify a set of maximum stable policies, giving in each time slot preference to users being in their best possible channel condition. We find in particular that many opportunistic scheduling policies like Score-Based, Proportionally Best or Potential Improvement are stable under the maximum stability conditions, whereas the opportunistic scheduler Relative-Best or the cmu-rule are not. (2) We show that choosing the right tie-breaking rule is crucial for the performance (e.g. average delay) as perceived by a user. We prove that a policy is asymptotically optimal if it is maximum stable and the tie-breaking rule gives priority to the user with the highest departure probability. We will refer to such tie-breaking rule as myopic. (3) We derive the growth rates of the number of users in the system in overload settings under various policies, which give additional insights on the performance. (4) We conclude that simple priority-index policies with the myopic tie-breaking rule, are stable and asymptotically optimal. All our findings are validated with extensive numerical experiments.',

	{'abstract': u'In this work we are analyzing scalability of the heuristic algorithm we used in the past to discover knowledge from multi-valued symbolic attributes in fuzzy databases. The non-atomic descriptors, characterizing a single attribute of a database record, are commonly used in fuzzy databases to reflect uncertainty about the recorded observation. In this paper, we present implementation details and scalability tests of the algorithm, which we developed to precisely interpret such non-atomic values and to transfer (i.e. defuzzify) the fuzzy tuples to the forms acceptable for many regular (i.e. atomic values based) data mining algorithms. Important advantages of our approach are: (1) its linear scalability, and (2) its unique capability of incorporating background knowledge, implicitly stored in the fuzzy database models in the form of fuzzy similarity hierarchy, into the interpretation/defuzzification process.',

The main goal of application-layer multicast is to construct and maintain efficient distribution structures between endhosts. In this paper we focus on the implementation of an application-layer multicast network using PlanetLab. We observe that the total time required to measure network latency over TCP is influenced dramatically by the TCP connection time. We argue that end-host distribution is not only influenced by the quality of network links but also by the time required to make connections between nodes.

	{'abstract': u'This paper is concerned with the problem of implementing an unbounded timestamp object from multi-writer atomic registers, in an asynchronous distributed system of n processors with distinct identifiers where timestamps are taken from an arbitrary universe. Ellen, Fatourou and Ruppert (2008) showed that sqrt/2-O(1) registers are required for any obstruction-free implementation of long-lived timestamp systems from atomic registers (meaning processors can repeatedly get timestamps). We improve this existing lower bound in two ways. First we establish a lower bound of n/6 - O(1) registers for the obstruction-free long-lived timestamp problem. Previous such linear lower bounds were only known for constrained versions of the timestamp problem. This bound is asymptotically tight; Ellen, Fatourou and Ruppert (2008) constructed a wait-free algorithm that uses n-1 registers. Second we show that sqrt - O(1) registers are required for any obstruction-free implementation of one-shot timestamp systems(meaning each processor can get a timestamp at most once). We show that this bound is also asymptotically tight by providing a wait-free one-shot timestamp system that uses fewer than 2 sqrt registers, thus establishing a space complexity gap between one-shot and long-lived timestamp systems.',

	{'abstract': u'We consider the problem of simultaneous user-scheduling, power-allocation, and rate-selection in an OFDMA downlink, with the goal of maximizing expected sum-utility under a sum-power constraint. In doing so, we consider a family of generic goodput-based utilities that facilitate, e.g., throughput-based pricing, quality-of-service enforcement, and/or the treatment of practical modulation-and-coding schemes (MCS). Since perfect knowledge of channel state information (CSI) may be difficult to maintain at the base-station, especially when the number of users and/or subchannels is large, we consider scheduling and resource allocation under imperfect CSI, where the channel state is described by a generic probability distribution. First, we consider the "continuous" case where multiple users and/or code rates can time-share a single OFDMA subchannel and time slot. This yields a non-convex optimization problem that we convert into a convex optimization problem and solve exactly using a dual optimization approach. Second, we consider the "discrete" case where only a single user and code rate is allowed per OFDMA subchannel per time slot. For the mixed-integer optimization problem that arises, we discuss the connections it has with the continuous case and show that it can solved exactly in some situations. For the other situations, we present a bound on the optimality gap. For both cases, we provide algorithmic implementations of the obtained solution. Finally, we study, numerically, the performance of the proposed algorithms under various degrees of CSI uncertainty, utilities, and OFDMA system configurations. In addition, we demonstrate advantages relative to existing state-of-the-art algorithms.',

	{'abstract': u'A novel framework of compressed sensing, namely statistical compressed sensing (SCS), that aims at efficiently sampling a collection of signals that follow a statistical distribution, and achieving accurate reconstruction on average, is introduced. SCS based on Gaussian models is investigated in depth. For signals that follow a single Gaussian model, with Gaussian or Bernoulli sensing matrices of O(k) measurements, considerably smaller than the O(k log(N/k)) required by conventional CS based on sparse models, where N is the signal dimension, and with an optimal decoder implemented via linear filtering, significantly faster than the pursuit decoders applied in conventional CS, the error of SCS is shown tightly upper bounded by a constant times the best k-term approximation error, with overwhelming probability. The failure probability is also significantly smaller than that of conventional sparsity-oriented CS. Stronger yet simpler results further show that for any sensing matrix, the error of Gaussian SCS is upper bounded by a constant times the best k-term approximation with probability one, and the bound constant can be efficiently calculated. For Gaussian mixture models (GMMs), that assume multiple Gaussian distributions and that each signal follows one of them with an unknown index, a piecewise linear estimator is introduced to decode SCS. The accuracy of model selection, at the heart of the piecewise linear decoder, is analyzed in terms of the properties of the Gaussian distributions and the number of sensing measurements. A maximum a posteriori expectation-maximization algorithm that iteratively estimates the Gaussian models parameters, the signals model selection, and decodes the signals, is presented for GMM-based SCS. In real image sensing applications, GMM-based SCS is shown to lead to improved results compared to conventional CS, at a considerably lower computational cost.',

Moreover, we consider the memory requirements for both players and give matching upper and lower bounds on the size of winning strategies.

The results obtained from this model match the available experimental results, which are for routing and opportunistic network coding, with fidelity. Using this model, we show that fairness allocation by the MAC can seriously impact performance; hence, we devise a new MAC that not only substantially improves throughput relative to the current 802.11 MAC, but also provides fairness to flows of information rather than to nodes. We show that the proper combination of network coding, multi-packet reception, and our new MAC protocol achieves super-additive throughput gains of up to 6.3 times that of routing alone with the use of the standard 802.11 MAC. Finally, we extend the model to analyze the asymptotic behavior of our new MAC as the number of nodes increases.',

Inspired by the work of Etkin, Tse and Wang, which derived a capacity region outer bound for the two-user Gaussian interference channel and proved that a simple Han-Kobayashi power splitting scheme can achieve to within one bit of the capacity region for all values of channel parameters, this paper shows that a similar strategy also achieves the capacity region for the -user cyclic interference channel to within a constant gap in the weak interference regime. Specifically, a compact representation of the Han-Kobayashi achievable rate region using Fourier-Motzkin elimination is first derived, a capacity region outer bound is then established. It is shown that the Etkin-Tse-Wang power splitting strategy gives a constant gap of at most two bits (or one bit per dimension) in the weak interference regime. Finally, the capacity result of the -user cyclic Gaussian interference channel in the strong interference regime is also given.',

	{'abstract': u'This paper presents a new effective method for image encryption which employs magnitude and phase manipulation using Differential Evolution (DE) approach. The novelty of this work lies in deploying the concept of keyed discrete Fourier transform (DFT) followed by DE operations for encryption purpose. To this end, a secret key is shared between both encryption and decryption sides. Firstly two dimensional (2-D) keyed discrete Fourier transform is carried out on the original image to be encrypted. Secondly crossover is performed between two components of the encrypted image, which are selected based on Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR) index generator. Similarly, keyed mutation is performed on the real parts of a certain components selected based on LFSR index generator. The LFSR index generator initializes it seed with the shared secret key to ensure the security of the resulting indices. The process shuffles the positions of image pixels. A new image encryption scheme based on the DE approach is developed which is composed with a simple diffusion mechanism. The deciphering process is an invertible process using the same key. The resulting encrypted image is found to be fully distorted, resulting in increasing the robustness of the proposed work. The simulation results validate the proposed image encryption scheme.',

When Administrator is updating the system, at the same time that updation is visible to the user.",

	{'abstract': u"Dual energy computerized tomography has gained great interest because of its ability to characterize the chemical composition of a material rather than simply providing relative attenuation images as in conventional tomography. The purpose of this paper is to introduce a novel polychromatic dual energy processing algorithm with an emphasis on detection and characterization of piecewise constant objects embedded in an unknown, cluttered background. Physical properties of the objects, specifically the Compton scattering and photoelectric absorption coefficients, are assumed to be known with some level of uncertainty. Our approach is based on a level-set representation of the characteristic function of the object and encompasses a number of regularization techniques for addressing both the prior information we have concerning the physical properties of the object as well as fundamental, physics-based limitations associated with our ability to jointly recover the Compton scattering and photoelectric absorption properties of the scene. In the absence of an object with appropriate physical properties, our approach returns a null characteristic function and thus can be viewed as simultaneously solving the detection and characterization problems. Unlike the vast majority of methods which define the level set function non-parametrically, i.e., as a dense set of pixel values), we define our level set parametrically via radial basis functions (RBF's) and employ a Gauss-Newton type algorithm for cost minimization. Numerical results show that the algorithm successfully detects objects of interest, finds their shape and location, and gives a adequate reconstruction of the background.",

	{'abstract': u'Currently there is considerable interest in making use of many-core processor architectures, such as Nvidia and AMD graphics processing units (GPUs) for scientific computing. In this work we explore the use of the Open Computing Language (OpenCL) for a typical Numerical Relativity application: a time-domain Teukolsky equation solver (a linear, hyperbolic, partial differential equation solver using finite-differencing). OpenCL is the only vendor-agnostic and multi-platform parallel computing framework that has been adopted by all major processor vendors. Therefore, it allows us to write portable source-code and run it on a wide variety of compute hardware and perform meaningful comparisons. The outcome of our experimentation suggests that it is relatively straightforward to obtain order-of-magnitude gains in overall application performance by making use of many-core GPUs over multi-core CPUs and this fact is largely independent of the specific hardware architecture and vendor. We also observe that a single high-end GPU can match the performance of a small-sized, message-passing based CPU cluster.',

	{'abstract': u'In this paper, we consider maximizing the sum-rate in the uplink of a multi-cell OFDMA network. The problem has a non-convex combinatorial structure and is known to be NP hard. Due to the inherent complexity of implementing the optimal solution, firstly, we derive an upper and lower bound to the optimal average network throughput. Moreover, we investigate the performance of a near optimal single cell resource allocation scheme in the presence of ICI which leads to another easily computable lower bound. We then develop a centralized sub-optimal scheme that is composed of a geometric programming based power control phase in conjunction with an iterative subcarrier allocation phase. Although, the scheme is computationally complex, it provides an effective benchmark for low complexity schemes even without the power control phase. Finally, we propose less complex centralized and distributed schemes that are well-suited for practical scenarios. The computational complexity of all schemes is analyzed and performance is compared through simulations. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed low complexity schemes can achieve comparable performance to the centralized sub-optimal scheme in various scenarios. Moreover, comparisons with the upper and lower bounds provide insight on the performance gap between the proposed schemes and the optimal solution.',

	{'abstract': u"Recovery algorithms play a key role in compressive sampling (CS). Most of current CS recovery algorithms are originally designed for one-dimensional (1D) signal, while many practical signals are two-dimensional (2D). By utilizing 2D separable sampling, 2D signal recovery problem can be converted into 1D signal recovery problem so that ordinary 1D recovery algorithms, e.g. orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP), can be applied directly. However, even with 2D separable sampling, the memory usage and complexity at the decoder is still high. This paper develops a novel recovery algorithm called 2D-OMP, which is an extension of 1D-OMP. In the 2D-OMP, each atom in the dictionary is a matrix. At each iteration, the decoder projects the sample matrix onto 2D atoms to select the best matched atom, and then renews the weights for all the already selected atoms via the least squares. We show that 2D-OMP is in fact equivalent to 1D-OMP, but it reduces recovery complexity and memory usage significantly. What's more important, by utilizing the same methodology used in this paper, one can even obtain higher dimensional OMP (say 3D-OMP, etc.) with ease.",

	{'abstract': u'A natural requirement of many distributed structures is fault-tolerance: after some failures, whatever remains from the structure should still be effective for whatever remains from the network. In this paper we examine spanners of general graphs that are tolerant to vertex failures, and significantly improve their dependence on the number of faults , for all stretch bounds. For stretch we design a simple transformation that converts every -spanner construction with at most edges into an -fault-tolerant -spanner construction with at most edges. Applying this to standard greedy spanner constructions gives -fault tolerant -spanners with edges. The previous construction by Chechik, Langberg, Peleg, and Roddity [STOC 2009] depends similarly on but exponentially on (approximately like ). For the case and unit-length edges, an -approximation algorithm is known from recent work of Dinitz and Krauthgamer [arXiv 2010], where several spanner results are obtained using a common approach of rounding a natural flow-based linear programming relaxation. Here we use a different (stronger) LP relaxation and improve the approximation ratio to , which is, notably, independent of the number of faults . We further strengthen this bound in terms of the maximum degree by using the Lovasz Local Lemma. Finally, we show that most of our constructions are inherently local by designing equivalent distributed algorithms in the LOCAL model of distributed computation.',

	{'abstract': u'In this paper, the optimal spectral efficiency (data rate divided by the message bandwidth) that minimizes the probability of causing disruptive interference for ad hoc wireless networks or cognitive radios is investigated. Two basic problem constraints are considered: a given message size, or fixed data rate. Implicitly, the trade being optimized is between longer transmit duration and wider bandwidth versus higher transmit power. Both single-input single-output (SISO) and multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) links are considered. Here, a link optimizes its spectral efficiency to be a "good neighbor." The probability of interference is characterized by the probability that the signal power received by a hidden node in a wireless network exceeds some threshold. The optimized spectral efficiency is a function of the transmitter-to-hidden-node channel exponent, exclusively. It is shown that for typical channel exponents a spectral efficiency of slightly greater than 1~b/s/Hz per antenna is optimal. It is also shown that the optimal spectral efficiency is valid in the environment with multiple hidden nodes. Also explicit evaluations of the probability of collisions is presented as a function of spectral efficiency.',

	{'abstract': u'A fundamental question of longstanding theoretical interest is to prove the lowest exact count of real additions and multiplications required to compute a power-of-two discrete Fourier transform (DFT). For 35 years the split-radix algorithm held the record by requiring just 4n log n - 6n + 8 arithmetic operations on real numbers for a size-n DFT, and was widely believed to be the best possible. Recent work by Van Buskirk et al. demonstrated improvements to the split-radix operation count by using multiplier coefficients or "twiddle factors" that are not n-th roots of unity for a size-n DFT. This paper presents a Boolean Satisfiability-based proof of the lowest operation count for certain classes of DFT algorithms. First, we present a novel way to choose new yet valid twiddle factors for the nodes in flowgraphs generated by common power-of-two fast Fourier transform algorithms, FFTs. With this new technique, we can generate a large family of FFTs realizable by a fixed flowgraph. This solution space of FFTs is cast as a Boolean Satisfiability problem, and a modern Satisfiability Modulo Theory solver is applied to search for FFTs requiring the fewest arithmetic operations. Surprisingly, we find that there are FFTs requiring fewer operations than the split-radix even when all twiddle factors are n-th roots of unity.',

	{'abstract': u'In this paper, we explore how to constructively manipulate qubits by rotating Bloch spheres. It is revealed that three-rotation and one-rotation Hamiltonian controls can be constructed to steer qubits when two tunable Hamiltonian controls are available. It is demonstrated in this research that local-wave function controls such as Bang-Bang, triangle-function and quadratic function controls can be utilized to manipulate quantum states on the Bloch sphere. A new kind of time-energy performance index is proposed to trade-off time and energy resource cost, in which control magnitudes are optimized in terms of this kind of performance. It is further exemplified that this idea can be generalized to manipulate encoded qubits on the controllable subspace.',

	{'abstract': u'In this paper, delay-free, low complexity, joint source-channel coding (JSCC) for transmission of two correlated Gaussian memoryless sources over a Gaussian Multiple Access Channel (GMAC) is considered. The main contributions of the paper are two distributed JSCC schemes: one discrete scheme based on nested scalar quantization, and one hybrid discrete-analog scheme based on a scalar quantizer and a linear continuous mapping. The proposed schemes show promising performance which improve with increasing correlation and are robust against variations in noise level. Both schemes exhibit a constant gap to the performance upper bound when the channel signal-to-noise ratio gets large.',

	{'abstract': u"Interference Alignment (IA) is the process of designing signals in such a way that they cast overlapping shadows at their unintended receivers, while remaining distinguishable at the intended ones. Our goal in this paper is to come up with an algorithm for IA that runs at the transmitters only (and is transparent to the receivers), that doesn't require channel reciprocity, and that alleviates the need to alternate between the forward and reverse network as is the case in Distributed IA (Gomadam, Cadambe, Jafar 08'), thereby inducing significant overhead in certain environments where the channel changes frequently. Most importantly, our effort is focused on ensuring that this one-sided approach does not degrade the performance of the system w.r.t. Distributed IA (since it cannot improve it). As a first step, we model the interference in each receiver's desired signal as a function of the transmitters' beamforming vectors. We then propose a simple steepest descent (SD) algorithm and use it to minimize the interference in each receiver's desired signal space. We mathematically establish equivalences between our approach and the Distributed IA algorithm (Gomadam, Cadambe, Jafar 08') and show that our algorithm also converges to an alignment solution (when the solution is feasible).",

	{'abstract': u'Finding a match between partially available deformable shapes is a challenging problem with numerous applications. The problem is usually approached by computing local descriptors on a pair of shapes and then establishing a point-wise correspondence between the two. In this paper, we introduce an alternative correspondence-less approach to matching fragments to an entire shape undergoing a non-rigid deformation. We use diffusion geometric descriptors and optimize over the integration domains on which the integral descriptors of the two parts match. The problem is regularized using the Mumford-Shah functional. We show an efficient discretization based on the Ambrosio-Tortorelli approximation generalized to triangular meshes. Experiments demonstrating the success of the proposed method are presented.',

	{'abstract': u'Finite state automata (FSA) are ubiquitous in computer science. Two of the most important algorithms for FSA processing are the conversion of a non-deterministic finite automaton (NFA) to a deterministic finite automaton (DFA), and then the production of the unique minimal DFA for the original NFA. We exhibit a parallel disk-based algorithm that uses a cluster of 29 commodity computers to produce an intermediate DFA with almost two billion states and then continues by producing the corresponding unique minimal DFA with less than 800,000 states. The largest previous such computation in the literature was carried out on a 512-processor CM-5 supercomputer in 1996. That computation produced an intermediate DFA with 525,000 states and an unreported number of states for the corresponding minimal DFA. The work is used to provide strong experimental evidence satisfying a conjecture on a series of token passing networks. The conjecture concerns stack sortable permutations for a finite stack and a 3-buffer. The origins of this problem lie in the work on restricted permutations begun by Knuth and Tarjan in the late 1960s. The parallel disk-based computation is also compared with both a single-threaded and multi-threaded RAM-based implementation using a 16-core 128 GB large shared memory computer.',

	{'abstract': u'We investigate the high-dimensional regression problem using adjacency matrices of unbalanced expander graphs. In this frame, we prove that the -prediction error and the -risk of the lasso and the Dantzig selector are optimal up to an explicit multiplicative constant. Thus we can estimate a high-dimensional target vector with an error term similar to the one obtained in a situation where one knows the support of the largest coordinates in advance. Moreover, we show that these design matrices have an explicit restricted eigenvalue. Precisely, they satisfy the restricted eigenvalue assumption and the compatibility condition with an explicit constant. Eventually, we capitalize on the recent construction of unbalanced expander graphs due to Guruswami, Umans, and Vadhan, to provide a deterministic polynomial time construction of these design matrices.',

In this paper we extend the general theory to randomized multi-step Lyapunov theory to obtain criteria for stability and steady-state performance bounds, such as finite moments. These results are applied to a remote stabilization problem, in which a controller receives measurements from an erasure channel with limited capacity. Based on the general results in the paper it is shown that stability of the closed loop system is assured provided that the channel capacity is greater than the logarithm of the unstable eigenvalue, plus an additional correction term. The existence of a finite second moment in steady-state is established under additional conditions.',

	{'abstract': u'The idea that many important classes of signals can be well-represented by linear combinations of a small set of atoms selected from a given dictionary has had dramatic impact on the theory and practice of signal processing. For practical problems in which an appropriate sparsifying dictionary is not known ahead of time, a very popular and successful heuristic is to search for a dictionary that minimizes an appropriate sparsity surrogate over a given set of sample data. While this idea is appealing, the behavior of these algorithms is largely a mystery; although there is a body of empirical evidence suggesting they do learn very effective representations, there is little theory to guarantee when they will behave correctly, or when the learned dictionary can be expected to generalize. In this paper, we take a step towards such a theory. We show that under mild hypotheses, the dictionary learning problem is locally well-posed: the desired solution is indeed a local minimum of the norm. Namely, if is an incoherent (and possibly overcomplete) dictionary, and the coefficients follow a random sparse model, then with high probability is a local minimum of the norm over the manifold of factorizations satisfying , provided the number of samples . For overcomplete , this is the first result showing that the dictionary learning problem is locally solvable. Our analysis draws on tools developed for the problem of completing a low-rank matrix from a small subset of its entries, which allow us to overcome a number of technical obstacles; in particular, the absence of the restricted isometry property.',

	{'abstract': u'We analyze push and pull for data collection in wireless sensor networks. Most applications to date use the traditional push approach, where nodes transmit sensed data immedi- ately to the sink. Using a pull approach, nodes store the data in their local flash memory, and only engage in commu- nication during dedicated collection phases. We show how one can transform an existing push-based collection protocol into a pull-based one, and compare the power consumption of both approaches on a 35-node testbed. Our results show that substantial energy gains are possible with pull, provided that the application can tolerate a long latency.',

	{'abstract': u"As we add rigid bars between points in the plane, at what point is there a giant (linear-sized) rigid component, which can be rotated and translated, but which has no internal flexibility? If the points are generic, this depends only on the combinatorics of the graph formed by the bars. We show that if this graph is an Erdos-Renyi random graph G(n,c/n), then there exists a sharp threshold for a giant rigid component to emerge. For c &lt; c_2, w.h.p. all rigid components span one, two, or three vertices, and when c &gt; c_2, w.h.p. there is a giant rigid component. The constant c_2 approx 3.588 is the threshold for 2-orientability, discovered independently by Fernholz and Ramachandran and Cain, Sanders, and Wormald in SODA'07. We also give quantitative bounds on the size of the giant rigid component when it emerges, proving that it spans a (1-o(1))-fraction of the vertices in the (3+2)-core. Informally, the (3+2)-core is maximal induced subgraph obtained by starting from the 3-core and then inductively adding vertices with 2 neighbors in the graph obtained so far.",

	{'abstract': u'We present algorithms revealing new families of polynomials allowing sub-exponential detection of p-adic rational roots, relative to the sparse encoding. For instance, we show that the case of honest n-variate (n+1)-nomials is doable in NP and, for p exceeding the Newton polytope volume and not dividing any coefficient, in constant time. Furthermore, using the theory of linear forms in p-adic logarithms, we prove that the case of trinomials in one variable can be done in NP. The best previous complexity bounds for these problems were EXPTIME or worse. Finally, we prove that detecting p-adic rational roots for sparse polynomials in one variable is NP-hard with respect to randomized reductions. The last proof makes use of an efficient construction of primes in certain arithmetic progressions. The smallest n where detecting p-adic rational roots for n-variate sparse polynomials is NP-hard appears to have been unknown.',

	{'abstract': u'Recent research in multi-robot exploration and mapping has focused on sampling environmental fields, which are typically modeled using the Gaussian process (GP). Existing information-theoretic exploration strategies for learning GP-based environmental field maps adopt the non-Markovian problem structure and consequently scale poorly with the length of history of observations. Hence, it becomes computationally impractical to use these strategies for in situ, real-time active sampling. To ease this computational burden, this paper presents a Markov-based approach to efficient information-theoretic path planning for active sampling of GP-based fields. We analyze the time complexity of solving the Markov-based path planning problem, and demonstrate analytically that it scales better than that of deriving the non-Markovian strategies with increasing length of planning horizon. For a class of exploration tasks called the transect sampling task, we provide theoretical guarantees on the active sampling performance of our Markov-based policy, from which ideal environmental field conditions and sampling task settings can be established to limit its performance degradation due to violation of the Markov assumption. Empirical evaluation on real-world temperature and plankton density field data shows that our Markov-based policy can generally achieve active sampling performance comparable to that of the widely-used non-Markovian greedy policies under less favorable realistic field conditions and task settings while enjoying significant computational gain over them.',

In an overlay network where each node has a local utility value, a Gradient overlay network is characterized by the properties that each node has a set of neighbors with the same utility value (a similar view) and a set of neighbors containing higher utility values (gradient neighbor set), such that paths of increasing utilities emerge in the network topology. The Gradient overlay network is built using gossiping and a preference function that samples from nodes using a uniform random peer sampling service. We analyze it using tools from matrix analysis, and we prove both the necessary and sufficient conditions for convergence to a complete gradient structure, as well as estimating the convergence time and providing bounds on worst-case convergence time. Finally, we show in simulations the potential of the Gradient overlay, by building a more efficient live-streaming peer-to-peer (P2P) system than one built using uniform random peer sampling.',

	{'abstract': u"We study the optimal pricing strategies of a monopolist selling a divisible good (service) to consumers that are embedded in a social network. A key feature of our model is that consumers experience a (positive) local network effect. In particular, each consumer's usage level depends directly on the usage of her neighbors in the social network structure. Thus, the monopolist's optimal pricing strategy may involve offering discounts to certain agents, who have a central position in the underlying network. First, we consider a setting where the monopolist can offer individualized prices and derive an explicit characterization of the optimal price for each consumer as a function of her network position. In particular, we show that it is optimal for the monopolist to charge each agent a price that is proportional to her Bonacich centrality in the social network. In the second part of the paper, we discuss the optimal strategy of a monopolist that can only choose a single uniform price for the good and derive an algorithm polynomial in the number of agents to compute such a price. Thirdly, we assume that the monopolist can offer the good in two prices, full and discounted, and study the problem of determining which set of consumers should be given the discount. We show that the problem is NP-hard, however we provide an explicit characterization of the set of agents that should be offered the discounted price. Next, we describe an approximation algorithm for finding the optimal set of agents. We show that if the profit is nonnegative under any feasible price allocation, the algorithm guarantees at least 88% of the optimal profit. Finally, we highlight the value of network information by comparing the profits of a monopolist that does not take into account the network effects when choosing her pricing policy to those of a monopolist that uses this information optimally.",

	{'abstract': u'Rainbow connection number rc(G) of a connected graph G is the minimum number of colours needed to colour the edges of G, so that every pair of vertices is connected by at least one path in which no two edges are coloured the same. In this paper we show that for every connected graph G, with minimum degree at least 2, the rainbow connection number is upper bounded by _c(G) + 2, where _c(G) is the connected domination number of G. Bounds of the form diameter(G) leq rc(G) leq diameter(G) + c, 1 leq c leq 4, for many special graph classes follow as easy corollaries from this result. This includes interval graphs, AT-free graphs, circular arc graphs, threshold graphs, and chain graphs all with minimum degree at least 2 and connected. We also show that every bridge-less chordal graph G has rc(G) leq 3.radius(G). In most of these cases, we also demonstrate the tightness of the bounds. An extension of this idea to two-step dominating sets is used to show that for every connected graph on n vertices with minimum degree , the rainbow connection number is upper bounded by 3n/( + 1) + 3. This solves an open problem of Schiermeyer (2009), improving the previously best known bound of 20n/ by Krivelevich and Yuster (2010). Moreover, this bound is seen to be tight up to additive factors by a construction of Caro et al. (2008).',

	{'abstract': u'Deploying cloud computing in an enterprise infrastructure bring significant security concerns. Successful implementation of cloud computing in an enterprise requires proper planning and understanding of emerging risks, threats, vulnerabilities, and possible countermeasures. We believe enterprise should analyze the company/organization security risks, threats, and available countermeasures before adopting this technology. In this paper, we have discussed security risks and concerns in cloud computing and enlightened steps that an enterprise can take to reduce security risks and protect their resources. We have also explained cloud computing strengths/benefits, weaknesses, and applicable areas in information risk management.',

	{'abstract': u'In low-dimensional topology, many important decision algorithms are based on normal surface enumeration, which is a form of vertex enumeration over a high-dimensional and highly degenerate polytope. Because this enumeration is subject to extra combinatorial constraints, the only practical algorithms to date have been variants of the classical double description method. In this paper we present the first practical normal surface enumeration algorithm that breaks out of the double description paradigm. This new algorithm is based on a tree traversal with feasibility and domination tests, and it enjoys a number of advantages over the double description method: incremental output, significantly lower time and space complexity, and a natural suitability for parallelisation. Experimental comparisons of running times are included.',

	{'abstract': u'We address the problem of estimating a random vector X from two sets of measurements Y and Z, such that the estimator is linear in Y. We show that the partially linear minimum mean squared error (PLMMSE) estimator does not require knowing the joint distribution of X and Y in full, but rather only its second-order moments. This renders it of potential interest in various applications. We further show that the PLMMSE method is minimax-optimal among all estimators that solely depend on the second-order statistics of X and Y. We demonstrate our approach in the context of recovering a signal, which is sparse in a unitary dictionary, from noisy observations of it and of a filtered version of it. We show that in this setting PLMMSE estimation has a clear computational advantage, while its performance is comparable to state-of-the-art algorithms. We apply our approach both in static and dynamic estimation applications. In the former category, we treat the problem of image enhancement from blurred/noisy image pairs, where we show that PLMMSE estimation performs only slightly worse than state-of-the art algorithms, while running an order of magnitude faster. In the dynamic setting, we provide a recursive implementation of the estimator and demonstrate its utility in the context of tracking maneuvering targets from position and acceleration measurements.',

	{'abstract': u'Recent experimental work has suggested that the neural firing rate can be interpreted as a fractional derivative, at least when signal variation induces neural adaptation. Here, we show that the actual neural spike-train itself can be considered as the fractional derivative, provided that the neural signal is approximated by a sum of power-law kernels. A simple standard thresholding spiking neuron suffices to carry out such an approximation, given a suitable refractory response. Empirically, we find that the online approximation of signals with a sum of power-law kernels is beneficial for encoding signals with slowly varying components, like long-memory self-similar signals. For such signals, the online power-law kernel approximation typically required less than half the number of spikes for similar SNR as compared to sums of similar but exponentially decaying kernels. As power-law kernels can be accurately approximated using sums or cascades of weighted exponentials, we demonstrate that the corresponding decoding of spike-trains by a receiving neuron allows for natural and transparent temporal signal filtering by tuning the weights of the decoding kernel.',

	{'abstract': u'Suppose you find the same username on different online services, what is the probability that these usernames refer to the same physical person? This work addresses what appears to be a fairly simple question, which has many implications for anonymity and privacy on the Internet. One possible way of estimating this probability would be to look at the public information associated to the two accounts and try to match them. However, for most services, these information are chosen by the users themselves and are often very heterogeneous, possibly false and difficult to collect. Furthermore, several websites do not disclose any additional public information about users apart from their usernames (e.g., discus- sion forums or Blog comments), nonetheless, they might contain sensitive information about users. This paper explores the possibility of linking users profiles only by looking at their usernames. The intuition is that the probability that two usernames refer to the same physical person strongly depends on the "entropy" of the username string itself. Our experiments, based on crawls of real web services, show that a significant portion of the users\' profiles can be linked using their usernames. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that usernames are considered as a source of information when profiling users on the Internet.',

	{'abstract': u"Historical documents such as old books and manuscripts have a high aesthetic value and highly appreciated. Unfortunately, there are some documents cannot be read due to quality problems like faded paper, ink expand, uneven colour tone, torn paper and other elements disruption such as the existence of small spots. The study aims to produce a copy of manuscript that shows clear wordings so they can easily be read and the copy can also be displayed for visitors. 16 samples of Jawi historical manuscript with different quality problems were obtained from The Royal Museum of Pahang, Malaysia. We applied three binarization techniques; Otsu's method represents global threshold technique; Sauvola and Niblack method which are categorized as local threshold techniques. We compared the binarized images with the original manuscript to be visually inspected by the museum's curator. The unclear features were marked and analyzed. Most of the examined images show that with optimal parameters and effective pre processing technique, local thresholding methods are work well compare with the other one. Niblack's and Sauvola's techniques seem to be the suitable approaches for these types of images. Most of binarized images with these two methods show improvement for readability and character recognition. For this research, even the differences of image result were hard to be distinguished by human capabilities, after comparing the time cost and overall achievement rate of recognized symbols, Niblack's method is performing better than Sauvola's. We could improve the post processing step by adding edge detection techniques and further enhanced by an innovative image refinement technique and a formulation of a class proper method.",

	{'abstract': u'The notion of was advocated in work of Feige, Immorlica, Mirrokni and Nazerzadeh [Approx 2009] as a measure of quality for approximation algorithms. There this concept was applied to facility location problems. In the current work we apply a similar framework to the maximum independent set problem (MIS). We say that an approximation algorithm has , if for every graph it recovers an independent set of size at least , where is the degree of vertex , and ranges over all independent sets in . Hence, in a sense, from every vertex in the maximum independent set the algorithm recovers a value of at least towards the solution. This quality measure is most effective in graphs in which the maximum independent set is composed of low degree vertices. It easily follows from known results that some simple algorithms for MIS ensure . We design a new randomized algorithm for MIS that ensures an expected recoverable value of at least . In addition, we show that approximating MIS in graphs with a given -coloring within a ratio larger than is unique games hard. This rules out a natural approach for obtaining .',

	{'abstract': u'Complex networks are an important paradigm of modern complex systems sciences which allows quantitatively assessing the structural properties of systems composed of different interacting entities. During the last years, intensive efforts have been spent on applying network-based concepts also for the analysis of dynamically relevant higher-order statistical properties of time series. Notably, many corresponding approaches are closely related with the concept of recurrence in phase space. In this paper, we review recent methodological advances in time series analysis based on complex networks, with a special emphasis on methods founded on recurrence plots. The potentials and limitations of the individual methods are discussed and illustrated for paradigmatic examples of dynamical systems as well as for real-world time series. Complex network measures are shown to provide information about structural features of dynamical systems that are complementary to those characterized by other methods of time series analysis and, hence, substantially enrich the knowledge gathered from other existing (linear as well as nonlinear) approaches.',

	{'abstract': u'Privacy-preserving techniques for distributed computation have been proposed recently as a promising framework in collaborative inter-domain network monitoring. Several different approaches exist to solve such class of problems, e.g., Homomorphic Encryption (HE) and Secure Multiparty Computation (SMC) based on Shamir\'s Secret Sharing algorithm (SSS). Such techniques are complete from a computation-theoretic perspective: given a set of private inputs, it is possible to perform arbitrary computation tasks without revealing any of the intermediate results. In fact, HE and SSS can operate also on secret inputs and/or provide secret outputs. However, they are computationally expensive and do not scale well in the number of players and/or in the rate of computation tasks. In this paper we advocate the use of "elementary" (as opposite to "complete") Secure Multiparty Computation (E-SMC) procedures for traffic monitoring. E-SMC supports only simple computations with private input and public output, i.e., it can not handle secret input nor secret (intermediate) output. Such a simplification brings a dramatic reduction in complexity and enables massive-scale implementation with acceptable delay and overhead. Notwithstanding its simplicity, we claim that an E-SMC scheme is sufficient to perform a great variety of computation tasks of practical relevance to collaborative network monitoring, including, e.g., anonymous publishing and set operations. This is achieved by combining a E-SMC scheme with data structures like Bloom Filters and bitmap strings.',

The Proper Interval Completion problem finds applications in molecular biology and genomic research. First announced by Kaplan, Tarjan and Shamir in FOCS '94, this problem is known to be FPT, but no polynomial kernel was known to exist. We settle this question by proving that Proper Interval Completion admits a kernel with at most O(k^5) vertices.

	{'abstract': u"In this Letter, we show that the explosive percolation is a novel continuous phase transition. The order-parameter-distribution histogram at the percolation threshold is studied in Erd Hs-R 'nyi networks, scale-free networks, and square lattice. In finite system, two well-defined Gaussian-like peaks coexist, and the valley between the two peaks is suppressed with the system size increasing. This finite-size effect always appears in typical first-order phase transition. However, both of the two peaks shift to zero point in a power law manner, which indicates the explosive percolation is continuous in the thermodynamic limit. The nature of explosive percolation in all the three structures belongs to this novel continuous phase transition. Various scaling exponents concerning the order-parameter-distribution are obtained.",

	{'abstract': u'The problem of storing a set of strings --- a string dictionary --- in compact form appears naturally in many cases. While classically it has represented a small part of the whole data to be processed (e.g., for Natural Language processing or for indexing text collections), more recent applications in Web engines, Web mining, RDF graphs, Internet routing, Bioinformatics, and many others, make use of very large string dictionaries, whose size is a significant fraction of the whole data. Thus novel approaches to compress them efficiently are necessary. In this paper we experimentally compare time and space performance of some existing alternatives, as well as new ones we propose. We show that space reductions of up to 20% of the original size of the strings is possible while supporting fast dictionary searches.',

	{'abstract': u"Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have many potential applications [1, 5] and unique challenges. They usually consist of hundreds or thousands small sensor nodes such as MICA2, which operate autonomously; conditions such as cost, invisible deployment and many application domains, lead to small size and limited resources sensors [2]. WSNs are susceptible to many types of link layer attacks [1] and most of traditional networks security techniques are unusable on WSNs [2]; due to wireless and shared nature of communication channel, untrusted transmissions, deployment in open environments, unattended nature and limited resources [1]. So, security is a vital requirement for these networks; but we have to design a proper security mechanism that attends to WSN's constraints and requirements. In this paper, we focus on security of WSNs, divide it (the WSNs security) into four categories and will consider them, include: an overview of WSNs, security in WSNs, the threat model on WSNs, a wide variety of WSNs' link layer attacks and a comparison of them. This work enables us to identify the purpose and capabilities of the attackers; also, the goal and effects of the link layer attacks on WSNs are introduced. Also, this paper discusses known approaches of security detection and defensive mechanisms against the link layer attacks; this would enable it security managers to manage the link layer attacks of WSNs more effectively.",

	{'abstract': u'In a data center network, for example, it is quite often to use controllers to manage resources in a centralized man- ner. Centralized control, however, imposes a scalability problem. In this paper, we investigate the use of multiple independent controllers instead of a single omniscient controller to manage resources. Each controller looks after a portion of the network only, but they together cover the whole network. This therefore solves the scalability problem. We use flow allocation as an example to see how this approach can manage the bandwidth use in a distributed manner. The focus is on how to assign components of a network to the controllers so that (1) each controller only need to look after a small part of the network but (2) there is at least one controller that can answer any request. We outline a way to configure the controllers to fulfill these requirements as a proof that the use of devolved controllers is possible. We also discuss several issues related to such implementation.',

	{'abstract': u'We present a novel method of simulating wave effects in graphics using ray--based renderers with a new function: the Wave BSDF (Bidirectional Scattering Distribution Function). Reflections from neighboring surface patches represented by local BSDFs are mutually independent. However, in many surfaces with wavelength-scale microstructures, interference and diffraction requires a joint analysis of reflected wavefronts from neighboring patches. We demonstrate a simple method to compute the BSDF for the entire microstructure, which can be used independently for each patch. This allows us to use traditional ray--based rendering pipelines to synthesize wave effects of light and sound. We exploit the Wigner Distribution Function (WDF) to create transmissive, reflective, and emissive BSDFs for various diffraction phenomena in a physically accurate way. In contrast to previous methods for computing interference, we circumvent the need to explicitly keep track of the phase of the wave by using BSDFs that include positive as well as negative coefficients. We describe and compare the theory in relation to well understood concepts in rendering and demonstrate a straightforward implementation. In conjunction with standard raytracers, such as PBRT, we demonstrate wave effects for a range of scenarios such as multi--bounce diffraction materials, holograms and reflection of high frequency surfaces.',

	{'abstract': u'In this research report details of design of a miniature wheel arrangement are presented. This miniature wheel arrangement is essentially a direction control mechanism intended for use on a mobile robot platform or base. The design is a specific one employing a stepper motor as actuator and as described can only be used on a certain type of wheeled robots. However, as a basic steering control element, more than one of these miniature wheel arrangements can be grouped together to implement more elaborate and intelligent direction control schemes on varying configurations of wheeled mobile robot platforms.',

	{'abstract': u'We provide a simple proof that graphs in a general class of self-similar networks have zero percolation threshold. The considered self-similar networks include random scale-free graphs with given expected node degrees and zero clustering, scale-free graphs with finite clustering and metric structure, growing scale-free networks, and many real networks. The proof and the derivation of the giant component size do not require the assumption that networks are treelike. Our results rely only on the observation that self-similar networks possess a hierarchy of nested subgraphs whose average degree grows with their depth in the hierarchy. We conjecture that this property is pivotal for percolation in networks.',

	{'abstract': u'Our objective is to sample the node set of a large unknown graph via crawling, to accurately estimate a given metric of interest. We design a random walk on an appropriately defined weighted graph that achieves high efficiency by preferentially crawling those nodes and edges that convey greater information regarding the target metric. Our approach begins by employing the theory of stratification to find optimal node weights, for a given estimation problem, under an independence sampler. While optimal under independence sampling, these weights may be impractical under graph crawling due to constraints arising from the structure of the graph. Therefore, the edge weights for our random walk should be chosen so as to lead to an equilibrium distribution that strikes a balance between approximating the optimal weights under an independence sampler and achieving fast convergence. We propose a heuristic approach (stratified weighted random walk, or S-WRW) that achieves this goal, while using only limited information about the graph structure and the node properties. We evaluate our technique in simulation, and experimentally, by collecting a sample of Facebook college users. We show that S-WRW requires 13-15 times fewer samples than the simple re-weighted random walk (RW) to achieve the same estimation accuracy for a range of metrics.',

	{'abstract': u'The promise of punishment and reward in promoting public cooperation is debatable. While punishment is traditionally considered more successful than reward, the fact that the cost of punishment frequently fails to offset gains from enhanced cooperation has lead some to reconsider reward as the main catalyst behind collaborative efforts. Here we elaborate on the "stick versus carrot" dilemma by studying the evolution of cooperation in the spatial public goods game, where besides the traditional cooperators and defectors, rewarding cooperators supplement the array of possible strategies. The latter are willing to reward cooperative actions at a personal cost, thus effectively downgrading pure cooperators to second-order free-riders due to their unwillingness to bear these additional costs. Consequently, we find that defection remains viable, especially if the rewarding is costly. Rewards, however, can promote cooperation, especially if the synergetic effects of cooperation are low. Surprisingly, moderate rewards may promote cooperation better than high rewards, which is due to the spontaneous emergence of cyclic dominance between the three strategies.',

	{'abstract': u'The emerging need for qualitative approaches in context-aware information processing calls for proper modeling of context information and efficient handling of its inherent uncertainty resulted from human interpretation and usage. Many of the current approaches to context-awareness either lack a solid theoretical basis for modeling or ignore important requirements such as modularity, high-order uncertainty management and group-based context-awareness. Therefore, their real-world application and extendability remains limited. In this paper, we present f-Context as a service-based context-awareness framework, based on language-action perspective (LAP) theory for modeling. Then we identify some of the complex, informational parts of context which contain high-order uncertainties due to differences between members of the group in defining them. An agent-based perceptual computer architecture is proposed for implementing f-Context that uses computing with words (CWW) for handling uncertainty. The feasibility of f-Context is analyzed using a realistic scenario involving a group of mobile users. We believe that the proposed approach can open the door to future research on context-awareness by offering a theoretical foundation based on human communication, and a service-based layered architecture which exploits CWW for context-aware, group-based and platform-independent access to information systems.',

	{'abstract': u'Current progresses in home automation and service robotic environment have highlighted the need to develop interoperability mechanisms that allow a standard communication between the two systems. During the development of the DHCompliant protocol, the problem of locating mobile devices in an indoor environment has been investigated. The communication of the device with the location service has been carried out to study the time delay that web services offer in front of the sockets. The importance of obtaining data from real-time location systems portends that a basic tool for interoperability, such as web services, can be ineffective in this scenario because of the delays added in the invocation of services. This paper is focused on introducing a web service to resolve a coordinates request without any significant delay in comparison with the sockets.',

This answers (negatively) the question of whether this probabilistic bound was exact, which has remained open for more than 30 years.

	{'abstract': u'A general theory of resource-bounded measurability and measure is developed. Starting from any feasible probability measure on the Cantor space and any suitable complexity class , the theory identifies the subsets of that are -measurable in and assigns measures to these sets, thereby endowing with internal measure-theoretic structure. Classes to which the theory applies include various exponential time and space complexity classes, the class of all decidable languages, and the Cantor space itself, on which the resource-bounded theory is shown to agree with the classical theory. The sets that are -measurable in are shown to form an algebra relative to which -measure is well-behaved. This algebra is also shown to be complete and closed under sufficiently uniform infinitary unions and intersections, and -measure in is shown to have the appropriate additivity and monotone convergence properties with respect to such infinitary operations. A generalization of the classical Kolmogorov zero-one law is proven, showing that when is any feasible coin-toss probability measure on , every set that is -measurable in and (like most complexity classes) invariant under finite alterations must have -measure 0 or -measure 1 in . The theory is presented here is based on resource-bounded martingale splitting operators, which are type-2 functionals, each of which maps into , where is the set of all -martingales. This type-2 aspect of the theory appears to be essential for general -measure in complexity classes , but the sets of -measure 0 or 1 in C are shown to be characterized by the success conditions for martingales (type-1 functions) that have been used in resource-bounded measure to date.',

The main challenge in DFE is the feedback symbol selection rule. In this paper, we give a theoretical framework for a simple, sparsity based thresholding algorithm. We feed back multiple symbols in each iteration, so the algorithm converges fast and has a low computational cost. We show how the initial solution can be obtained via convex relaxation instead of linear equalization, and illustrate the impact that the choice of the initial solution has on the bit error rate performance of our algorithm. The algorithm is applicable in several existing wireless communication systems (SC-FDMA, MC-CDMA, MIMO-OFDM). Numerical results illustrate significant performance improvement in terms of bit error rate compared to the MMSE solution.',

	{'abstract': u'We present a nested lattice-code-based strategy that achieves the random-coding based Compress-and-Forward (CF) rate for the three node Gaussian relay channel. To do so, we first outline a lattice-based strategy for the Wyner-Ziv lossy source-coding with side-information problem in Gaussian noise, a re-interpretation of the nested lattice-code-based Gaussian Wyner-Ziv scheme presented by Zamir, Shamai, and Erez. We use the notation Wyner-Ziv to mean that the source is of the form and the side-information at the receiver is of the form , for independent Gaussian and . We next use this Wyner-Ziv scheme to implement a "structured" or lattice-code-based CF scheme which achieves the classic CF rate for Gaussian relay channels. This suggests that lattice codes may not only be useful in point-to-point single-hop source and channel coding, in multiple access and broadcast channels, but that they may also be useful in larger relay networks. The usage of lattice codes in larger networks is motivated by their structured nature (possibly leading to rate gains) and decoding (relatively simple) being more practically realizable than their random coding based counterparts. We furthermore expect the proposed lattice-based CF scheme to constitute a first step towards a generic structured achievability scheme for networks such as a structured version of the recently introduced "noisy network coding".',

	{'abstract': u"We consider two important time scales---the Markov and cryptic orders---that monitor how an observer synchronizes to a finitary stochastic process. We show how to compute these orders exactly and that they are most efficiently calculated from the epsilon-machine, a process's minimal unifilar model. Surprisingly, though the Markov order is a basic concept from stochastic process theory, it is not a probabilistic property of a process. Rather, it is a topological property and, moreover, it is not computable from any finite-state model other than the epsilon-machine. Via an exhaustive survey, we close by demonstrating that infinite Markov and infinite cryptic orders are a dominant feature in the space of finite-memory processes. We draw out the roles played in statistical mechanical spin systems by these two complementary length scales.",

	{'abstract': u'Goedel\'s functional "Dialectica" interpretation can be used to extract functional programs from non-constructive proofs in arithmetic by employing two sorts of higher-order witnessing terms: positive realisers and negative counterexamples. In the original interpretation decidability of atoms is required to compute the correct counterexample from a set of candidates. When combined with recursion, this choice needs to be made for every step in the extracted program, however, in some special cases the decision on negative witnesses can be calculated only once. We present a variant of the interpretation in which the time complexity of extracted programs can be improved by marking the chosen witness and thus avoiding recomputation. The achieved effect is similar to using an abortive control operator to interpret computational content of non-constructive principles.',

To introduce this notion, we show how entanglement-assisted (EA) repetition codes and accumulator codes are dual to each other, much like their classical counterparts, and we give an explicit, general quantum shift-register circuit that encodes both classes of codes.We later show that our constructions are optimal, and this result completes our understanding of these dual classes of codes. We also establish the Gilbert-Varshamov bound and the Plotkin bound for EAQEC codes, and we use these to examine the existence of some EAQEC codes.

It is sometimes presented as a symmetric constructive subsystem of classical logic. In this paper, we compare three sequent calculi for bi-intuitionistic propositional logic: (1) a basic standard-style sequent calculus that restricts the premises of implication-right and exclusion-left inferences to be single-conclusion resp. single-assumption and is incomplete without the cut rule, (2) the calculus with nested sequents by Gore et al., where a complete class of cuts is encapsulated into special "unnest" rules and (3) a cut-free labelled sequent calculus derived from the Kripke semantics of the logic. We show that these calculi can be translated into each other and discuss the ineliminable cuts of the standard-style sequent calculus.',

	{'abstract': u'The quality of image encryption is commonly measured by the Shannon entropy over the ciphertext image. However, this measurement does not consider to the randomness of local image blocks and is inappropriate for scrambling based image encryption methods. In this paper, a new information entropy-based randomness measurement for image encryption is introduced which, for the first time, answers the question of whether a given ciphertext image is sufficiently random-like. It measures the randomness over the ciphertext in a fairer way by calculating the averaged entropy of a series of small image blocks within the entire test image. In order to fulfill both quantitative and qualitative measurement, the expectation and the variance of this averaged block entropy for a true-random image are strictly derived and corresponding numerical reference tables are also provided. Moreover, a hypothesis test at significance?-level is given to help accept or reject the hypothesis that the test image is ideally encrypted/random-like. Simulation results show that the proposed test is able to give both e?ectively quantitative and qualitative results for image encryption. The same idea can also be applied to measure other digital data, like audio and video.',

	{'abstract': u"Studies of cooperation have traditionally focused on discrete games such as the well-known prisoner's dilemma, in which players choose between two pure strategies: cooperation and defection. Increasingly, however, cooperation is being studied in continuous games that feature a continuum of strategies determining the level of cooperative investment. For the continuous snowdrift game, it has been shown that a gradually evolving monomorphic population may undergo evolutionary branching, resulting in the emergence of a defector strategy that coexists with a cooperator strategy. This phenomenon has been dubbed the 'tragedy of the commune'. Here we study the effects of fluctuating group size on the tragedy of the commune and derive analytical conditions for evolutionary branching. Our results show that the effects of fluctuating group size on evolutionary dynamics critically depend on the structure of payoff functions. For games with additively separable benefits and costs, fluctuations in group size make evolutionary branching less likely, and sufficiently large fluctuations in group size can always turn an evolutionary branching point into a locally evolutionarily stable strategy. For games with multiplicatively separable benefits and costs, fluctuations in group size can either prevent or induce the tragedy of the commune. For games with general interactions between benefits and costs, we derive a general classification scheme based on second derivatives of the payoff function, to elucidate when fluctuations in group size help or hinder cooperation.",

All our results are in the standard word RAM model for points in rank space: ** We present two data structures for 2-d orthogonal range emptiness. The first achieves O(n lglg n) space and O(lglg n) query time. This improves the previous results by Alstrup, Brodal, and Rauhe(FOCS'00), with O(n lg^eps n) space and O(lglg n) query time, or with O(nlglg n) space and O(lg^2 lg n) query time. Our second data structure uses O(n) space and answers queries in O(lg^eps n) time. The best previous O(n)-space data structure, due to Nekrich (WADS'07), answers queries in O(lg n/lglg n) time. ** For 3-d orthogonal range reporting, we obtain space O(n lg^ n) and query time O(lglg n + k), for any constant eps&gt;0. This improves previous results by Afshani (ESA'08), Karpinski and Nekrich (COCOON'09), and Chan (SODA'11), with O(n lg^3 n) space and O(lglg n + k) query time, or with O(n lg^ n) space and O(lg^2 lg n + k) query time. This implies improved bounds for orthogonal range reporting in all constant dimensions above 3. ** We give a randomized algorithm for 4-d offline dominance range reporting/emptiness with running time O(n lg n + k). This resolves two open problems from Preparata and Shamos' seminal book: **** given n axis-aligned rectangles in the plane, we can report all k enclosure pairs in O(n lg n + k) expected time. The best known result was an O([n lg n + k] lglg n) algorithm from SoCG'95 by Gupta, Janardan, Smid, and Dasgupta. **** given n points in 4-d, we can find all maximal points in O(n lg n) expected time. The best previous result was an O(n lg n lglg n) algorithm due to Gabow, Bentley, and Tarjan (STOC'84). This implies record time bounds for the maxima problem in all constant dimensions above 4.",

	{'abstract': u'We introduce a new type of cryptographic primitive that we call hiding fingerprinting. A (quantum) fingerprinting scheme translates a binary string of length to (qu)bits, typically , such that given any string and a fingerprint of , one can decide with high accuracy whether . Classical fingerprinting schemes cannot hide information very well: a classical fingerprint of that guarantees error at most necessarily reveals bits about . We call a scheme hiding if it reveals bits; accordingly, no classical scheme is hiding. For any constant , we construct two kinds of hiding fingerprinting schemes, both mapping -bit strings to qubits and guaranteeing one-sided error probability at most . The first kind uses pure states and leaks at most bits, and the second kind uses mixed states and leaks at most bits, where the "leakage" is bounded via accessible information. The schemes are computationally efficient. Our mixed-state scheme is optimal, as shown via a generic strategy that extracts bits from any fingerprint over qubits.',

	{'abstract': u'Several proof translations of classical mathematics into intuitionistic mathematics have been proposed in the literature over the past century. These are normally referred to as negative translations or double-negation translations. Among those, the most commonly cited are translations due to Kolmogorov, Godel, Gentzen, Kuroda and Krivine (in chronological order). In this paper we propose a framework for explaining how these different translations are related to each other. More precisely, we define a notion of a (modular) simplification starting from Kolmogorov translation, which leads to a partial order between different negative translations. In this derived ordering, Kuroda and Krivine are minimal elements. Two new minimal translations are introduced, with Godel and Gentzen translations sitting in between Kolmogorov and one of these new translations.',

	{'abstract': u"The notion of information pervades informal descriptions of biological systems, but formal treatments face the problem of defining a quantitative measure of information rooted in a concept of fitness, which is itself an elusive notion. Here, we present a model of population dynamics where this problem is amenable to a mathematical analysis. In the limit where any information about future environmental variations is common to the members of the population, our model is equivalent to known models of financial investment. In this case, the population can be interpreted as a portfolio of financial assets and previous analyses have shown that a key quantity of Shannon's communication theory, the mutual information, sets a fundamental limit on the value of information. We show that this bound can be violated when accounting for features that are irrelevant in finance but inherent to biological systems, such as the stochasticity present at the individual level. This leads us to generalize the measures of uncertainty and information usually encountered in information theory.",

In this paper, the problem of sensor selection is studied for the MAC layer design of wireless sensor networks for regulating the voltages in smart grid. The framework of hybrid dynamical system is proposed, using Kalman filter for voltage state estimation and LQR feedback control for voltage adjustment. The approach to obtain the optimal sensor selection sequence is studied. A sub- optimal sequence is obtained by applying the sliding window algorithm. Simulation results show that the proposed sensor selection strategy achieves a 40% performance gain over the baseline algorithm of the round-robin sensor polling.",

In the Watts Strogatz type network, rewiring has been done in different ways and although the qualitative results remain same, finite differences in the exponents are observed. In the Euclidean type networks, where at least one finite phase transition occurs, two models differing in a similar way have been considered. The results show a possible shift in one of the phase transition points but no change in the values of the exponents.

	{'abstract': u'A primary motivation for our research in digital ecosystems is the desire to exploit the self-organising properties of biological ecosystems. Ecosystems are thought to be robust, scalable architectures that can automatically solve complex, dynamic problems. However, the computing technologies that contribute to these properties have not been made explicit in digital ecosystems research. Here, we discuss how different computing technologies can contribute to providing the necessary self-organising features, including Multi-Agent Systems (MASs), Service-Oriented Architectures (SOAs), and distributed evolutionary computing (DEC). The potential for exploiting these properties in digital ecosystems is considered, suggesting how several key features of biological ecosystems can be exploited in Digital Ecosystems, and discussing how mimicking these features may assist in developing robust, scalable self-organising architectures. An example architecture, the Digital Ecosystem, is considered in detail. The Digital Ecosystem is then measured experimentally through simulations, considering the self-organised diversity of its evolving agent populations relative to the user request behaviour.',

	{'abstract': u'We consider the two-user interference channel with rate-limited feedback. Related prior works focus on the case where feedback links have infinite capacity, while no research has been done for the rate-limited feedback problem. Several new challenges arise due to the capacity limitations of the feedback links, both in deriving inner-bounds and outer-bounds. We study this problem under three different interference models: the El Gamal-Costa deterministic model, the linear deterministic model, and the Gaussian model. For the first two models, we develop an achievable scheme that employs three techniques: Han-Kobayashi message splitting, quantize-and-binning, and decode-and-forward. We also derive new outer-bounds for all three models and we show the optimality of our scheme under the linear deterministic model. In the Gaussian case, we propose a transmission strategy that incorporates lattice codes, inspired by the ideas developed in the first two models. For symmetric channel gains, we prove that the gap between the achievable sum-rate of the proposed scheme and our new outer-bounds is bounded by a constant number of bits, independent of the channel gains.',

In this work, the set of linear extensions is embedded in a larger state space with a continuous parameter ?. The introduction of a continuous parameter allows for the use of a more efficient method for approximating called TPA. Our primary result is that it is possible to sample from this continuous embedding in time that as fast or faster than the best known methods for sampling uniformly from linear extensions.

	{'abstract': u'We present a study on connection errors in networks of linear features and methods of error detection. Connection errors occur in network datasets when the network elements are not connected according to specifications. We model networks with special connection specifications as networks with hierarchically connected features and define errors considering the spatial relationships and the functionality of the network elements. For the description of the necessary spatial relationships a spatial object model and an intersection model are proposed. A general definition of the problem of the detection of connection errors which takes into account the functionality of the network elements is discussed. Then a series of spatial algorithms that solve different aspects of the problem is presented. We also define and analyze the notion of geometrical reduction. The algorithms that we present use geometrical reduction so as to achieve efficient performance.',

	{'abstract': u'Most real-world complex systems can be modelled by coupled networks with multiple layers. How and to what extent the pattern of couplings between network layers may influence the interlaced structure and function of coupled networks are not clearly understood. Here we study the impact of correlated inter-layer couplings on the network robustness of coupled networks using percolation concept. We found that the positive correlated inter-layer coupling enhaces network robustness in the sense that it lowers the percolation threshold of the interlaced network than the negative correlated coupling case. At the same time, however, positive inter-layer correlation leads to smaller giant component size in the well-connected region, suggesting potential disadvantage for network connectivity, as demonstrated also with some real-world coupled network structures.',

	{'abstract': u'In this paper we consider methods for dynamically storing a set of different objects ("modules") in a physical array. Each module requires one free contiguous subinterval in order to be placed. Items are inserted or removed, resulting in a fragmented layout that makes it harder to insert further modules. It is possible to relocate modules, one at a time, to another free subinterval that is contiguous and does not overlap with the current location of the module. These constraints clearly distinguish our problem from classical memory allocation. We present a number of algorithmic results, including a bound of Theta(n^2) on physical sorting if there is a sufficiently large free space and sum up NP-hardness results for arbitrary initial layouts. For online scenarios in which modules arrive one at a time, we present a method that requires O(1) moves per insertion or deletion and amortized cost O(m_i log M) per insertion or deletion, where m_i is the module\'s size, M is the size of the largest module and costs for moves are linear in the size of a module.',

	{'abstract': u'We analyze the organization, promotion and public perception of V-day, a political rally that took place on September 8, 2007, to protest against corruption in the Italian Parliament. Launched by blogger Beppe Grillo, and promoted via a word of mouth mobilization on the Italian blogosphere, V-day brought close to one million Italians in the streets on a single day, but was mostly ignored by mainstream media. This article is divided into two parts. In the first part, we analyze the volume and content of online articles published by both bloggers and mainstream news sources from June 14 (the day V-day was announced) until September 15, 2007 (one week after it took place) . We find that the success of V-day can be attributed to the coverage of bloggers and small-scale local news outlets only, suggesting a strong grassroots component in the organization of the rally. We also find a dissonant thematic relationship between content published by blogs and mainstream media: while the majority of blogs analyzed promote V-day, major mainstream media sources critique the methods of information production and dissemination employed by Grillo. Based on this finding, in the second part of the study, we explore the role of Grillo in the organization of the rally from a network analysis perspective. We study the interlinking structure of the V-day blogosphere network, to determine its structure, its levels of heterogeneity, and resilience. Our analysis contradicts the hypothesis that Grillo served as a top-down, broadcast-like source of information. Rather, we find that information about V-day was transferred across heterogeneous nodes in a moderately robust and resilient core network of blogs. We speculate that the organization of V-day represents the very first case, in Italian history, of a political demonstration developed and promoted primarily via the use of social media on the web.',

	{'abstract': u'This paper studies geometrical structure of the manifold of escort probability distributions and shows its new applicability to information science. In order to realize escort probabilities we use a conformal transformation that flattens so-called alpha-geometry of the space of discrete probability distributions, which well characterizes nonadditive statistics on the space. As a result escort probabilities are proved to be flat coordinates of the usual probabilities for the derived dually flat structure. Finally, we demonstrate that escort probabilities with the new structure admits a simple algorithm to compute Voronoi diagrams and centroids with respect to alpha-divergences.',

	{'abstract': u'We study the problem of indexing text with wildcard positions, motivated by the challenge of aligning sequencing data to large genomes that contain millions of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)---positions known to differ between individuals. SNPs modeled as wildcards can lead to more informed and biologically relevant alignments. We improve the space complexity of previous approaches by giving a succinct index requiring bits for a text of length over an alphabet of size containing groups of wildcards. A key to the space reduction is a result we give showing how any compressed suffix array can be supplemented with auxiliary data structures occupying bits to also support efficient dictionary matching queries. The query algorithm for our wildcard index is faster than previous approaches using reasonable working space. More importantly our new algorithm greatly reduces the query working space to bits. We note that compared to previous results this reduces the working space by two orders of magnitude when aligning short read data to the Human genome.',

	{'abstract': u'Much of the current theory of networked control systems uses simple point-to-point communication models as an abstraction of the underlying network. As a result, the controller has very limited information on the network conditions and performs suboptimally. This work models the underlying wireless multihop mesh network as a graph of links with transmission success probabilities, and uses a recursive Bayesian estimator to provide packet delivery predictions to the controller. The predictions are a joint probability distribution on future packet delivery sequences, and thus capture correlations between successive packet deliveries. We look at finite horizon LQG control over a lossy actuation channel and a perfect sensing channel, both without delay, to study how the controller can compensate for predicted network outages.',

	{'abstract': u'The outage probability limit is a fundamental and achievable lower bound on the word error rate of coded communication systems affected by fading. This limit is mainly determined by two parameters: the diversity order and the coding gain. With linear precoding, full diversity on a block fading channel can be achieved without error-correcting code. However, the effect of precoding on the coding gain is not well known, mainly due to the complicated expression of the outage probability. Using a geometric approach, this paper establishes simple upper bounds on the outage probability, the minimization of which yields to precoding matrices that achieve very good performance. For discrete alphabets, it is shown that the combination of constellation expansion and precoding is sufficient to closely approach the minimum possible outage achieved by an i.i.d. Gaussian input distribution, thus essentially maximizing the coding gain.',

	{'abstract': u'Among the novel metrics used to study the relative importance of nodes in complex networks, k-core decomposition has found a number of applications in areas as diverse as sociology, proteinomics, graph visualization, and distributed system analysis and design. This paper proposes new distributed algorithms for the computation of the k-core decomposition of a network, with the purpose of (i) enabling the run-time computation of k-cores in "live" distributed systems and (ii) allowing the decomposition, over a set of connected machines, of very large graphs, that cannot be hosted in a single machine. Lower bounds on the algorithms complexity are given, and an exhaustive experimental analysis on real-world graphs is provided.',

	{'abstract': u'Cloud computing is a powerful new technology that is widely used in the business world. Recently, we have been investigating the benefits it offers to scientific computing. We have used three workflow applications to compare the performance of processing data on the Amazon EC2 cloud with the performance on the Abe high-performance cluster at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA). We show that the Amazon EC2 cloud offers better performance and value for processor- and memory-limited applications than for I/O-bound applications. We provide an example of how the cloud is well suited to the generation of a science product: an atlas of periodograms for the 210,000 light curves released by the NASA Kepler Mission. This atlas will support the identification of periodic signals, including those due to transiting exoplanets, in the Kepler data sets.',

	{'abstract': u'Despite the increasing maturity of model-driven software development (MDD), some research challenges remain open in the field of information systems (IS). For instance, there is a need to improve modelling techniques so that they cover several development stages in an integrated way, and they facilitate the transition from analysis to design. This paper presents Message Structures, a technique for the specification of communicative interactions between the IS and organisational actors. This technique can be used both in the analysis stage and in the design stage. During analysis, it allows abstracting from the technology that will support the IS, and to complement business process diagramming techniques with the specification of the communicational needs of the organisation. During design, Message Structures serves two purposes: (i) it allows to systematically derive a specification of the IS memory (e.g. a UML class diagram), (ii) and it allows to reason the user interface design using abstract patterns. This technique is part of Communication Analysis, a communication-oriented requirements engineering method, but it can be adopted in order to extend widely-used business process and functional requirements modelling techniques (e.g. BPMN, Use Cases). Moreover, the paper presents two tools that support Message Structures, one uses the Xtext technology, and the other uses the Eclipse Modelling Framework. Industrial experience has shown us that the technique can be adopted and applied in complex projects.',

	{'abstract': u'We consider the use of energy harvesters, in place of conventional batteries with fixed energy storage, for point-to-point wireless communications. In addition to the challenge of transmitting in a channel with time selective fading, energy harvesters provide a perpetual but unreliable energy source. In this paper, we consider the problem of energy allocation over a finite horizon, taking into account channel conditions and energy sources that are time varying, so as to maximize the throughput. Two types of side information (SI) on the channel conditions and harvested energy are assumed to be available: causal SI (of the past and present slots) or full SI (of the past, present and future slots). We obtain structural results for the optimal energy allocation, via the use of dynamic programming and convex optimization techniques. In particular, if unlimited energy can be stored in the battery with harvested energy and the full SI is available, we prove the optimality of a water-filling energy allocation solution where the so-called water levels follow a staircase function.',

	{'abstract': u'Information theory has explained the organization of many biological phenomena, from the physiology of sensory receptive fields to the variability of certain DNA sequence ensembles. Some scholars have proposed that information should provide the central explanatory principle in biology, in the sense that any behavioral strategy that is optimal for an organism\'s survival must necessarily involve efficient information processing. We challenge this view by providing a counterexample. We present an analytically tractable model for a particular instance of a perception-action loop: a creature searching for a food source confined to a one-dimensional ring world. The model incorporates the statistical structure of the creature\'s world, the effects of the creature\'s actions on that structure, and the creature\'s strategic decision process. The model takes the form of a Markov process on an infinite dimensional state space. To analyze it we construct an exact coarse graining that reduces the model to a Markov process on a finite number of "information states". This technique allows us to make quantitative comparisons between the performance of an information-theoretically optimal strategy with other candidate strategies on a food gathering task. We find that: 1. Information optimal search does not necessarily optimize utility (expected food gain). 2. The rank ordering of search strategies by information performance does not predict their ordering by expected food obtained. 3. The relative advantage of different strategies depends on the statistical structure of the environment, in particular the variability of motion of the source. We conclude that there is no simple relationship between information and utility. Behavioral optimality does not imply information efficiency, nor is there a simple tradeoff between gaining information about a food source versus obtaining the food itself.',

In our study, we consider a regenerative opportunistic relaying scheme in which the direct path can be considered unusable, and takes into account the effect of the possible erroneously detected and transmitted data at the best relay. We first derive statistics based on exact probability density function (PDF) of each hop. Then, the PDFs are used to determine accurate closed form expressions for end-to-end bit-error rate (BER) of binary phase-shift keying (BPSK) modulation. Furthermore, we evaluate the asymptotical performance analysis and the diversity order is deduced. Finally, we validate our analysis by showing that performance simulation results coincide with our analytical results over different network architectures.',

	{'abstract': u'We consider two styles of proof calculi for a family of tense logics, presented in a formalism based on nested sequents. A nested sequent can be seen as a tree of traditional single-sided sequents. Our first style of calculi is what we call "shallow calculi", where inference rules are only applied at the root node in a nested sequent. Our shallow calculi are extensions of Kashima\'s calculus for tense logic and share an essential characteristic with display calculi, namely, the presence of structural rules called "display postulates". Shallow calculi enjoy a simple cut elimination procedure, but are unsuitable for proof search due to the presence of display postulates and other structural rules. The second style of calculi uses deep-inference, whereby inference rules can be applied at any node in a nested sequent. We show that, for a range of extensions of tense logic, the two styles of calculi are equivalent, and there is a natural proof theoretic correspondence between display postulates and deep inference. The deep inference calculi enjoy the subformula property and have no display postulates or other structural rules, making them a better framework for proof search.',

	{'abstract': u'Many web databases can be seen as providing partial and overlapping information about entities in the world. To answer queries effectively, we need to integrate the information about the individual entities that are fragmented over multiple sources. At first blush this is just the inverse of traditional database normalization problem - rather than go from a universal relation to normalized tables, we want to reconstruct the universal relation given the tables (sources). The standard way of reconstructing the entities will involve joining the tables. Unfortunately, because of the autonomous and decentralized way in which the sources are populated, they often do not have Primary Key - Foreign Key relations. While tables may share attributes, naive joins over these shared attributes can result in reconstruction of many spurious entities thus seriously compromising precision. Our system, smartint is aimed at addressing the problem of data integration in such scenarios. Given a query, our system uses the Approximate Functional Dependencies (AFDs) to piece together a tree of relevant tables to answer it. The result tuples produced by our system are able to strike a favorable balance between precision and recall.',

When restricted to the single-agent decision-theoretic setting, inverse optimal control techniques assume that observed behavior is an approximately optimal solution to an unknown decision problem. These techniques learn a utility function that explains the example behavior and can then be used to accurately predict or imitate future behavior in similar observed or unobserved situations. In this work, we consider similar tasks in competitive and cooperative multi-agent domains. Here, unlike single-agent settings, a player cannot myopically maximize its reward --- it must speculate on how the other agents may act to influence the game's outcome. Employing the game-theoretic notion of regret and the principle of maximum entropy, we introduce a technique for predicting and generalizing behavior, as well as recovering a reward function in these domains.",

	{'abstract': u'Several challenging problem in clustering, partitioning and imaging have traditionally been solved using the "spectral technique". These problems include the normalized cut problem, the graph expander ratio problem, the Cheeger constant problem and the conductance problem. These problems share several common features: all seek a bipartition of a set of elements; the problems are formulated as a form of ratio cut; the formulation as discrete optimization is shown here to be equivalent to a quadratic ratio, sometimes referred to as the Raleigh ratio, on discrete variables and a single sum constraint which we call the balance or orthogonality constraint; when the discrete nature of the variables is disregarded, the continuous relaxation is solved by the spectral method. Indeed the spectral relaxation technique is a dominant method providing an approximate solution to these problems. We propose an algorithm for these problems which involves a relaxation of the orthogonality constraint only. This relaxation is shown here to be solved optimally, and in strongly polynomial time, in O(mn log((n^2) / m) for a graph on nodes and edges. The algorithm, using HPF (Hochbaum\'s Pseudo-Flow) as subroutine, is efficient enough to be used to solve these bi-partitioning problems on millions of elements and more than 300 million edges within less than 10 minutes. It is also demonstrated, via a preliminary experimental study, that the results of the combinatorial algorithm proposed often improve dramatically on the quality of the results of the spectral method.',

	{'abstract': u'The control software of the CERN Compact Muon Solenoid experiment contains over 30,000 finite state machines. These state machines are organised hierarchically: commands are sent down the hierarchy and state changes are sent upwards. The sheer size of the system makes it virtually impossible to fully understand the details of its behaviour at the macro level. This is fuelled by unclarities that already exist at the micro level. We have solved the latter problem by formally describing the finite state machines in the mCRL2 process algebra. The translation has been implemented using the ASF+SDF meta-environment, and its correctness was assessed by means of simulations and visualisations of individual finite state machines and through formal verification of subsystems of the control software. Based on the formalised semantics of the finite state machines, we have developed dedicated tooling for checking properties that can be verified on finite state machines in isolation.',

	{'abstract': u'In bibliometrics, the association of "impact" with central-tendency statistics is mistaken. Impacts add up, and citation curves should therefore be integrated instead of averaged. For example, the journals MIS Quarterly and JASIST differ by a factor of two in terms of their respective impact factors (IF), but the journal with the lower IF has the higher impact. Using percentile ranks (e.g., top-1%, top-10%, etc.), an integrated impact indicator (I3) can be based on integration of the citation curves, but after normalization of the citation curves to the same scale. The results across document sets can be compared as percentages of the total impact of a reference set. Total number of citations, however, should not be used instead because the shape of the citation curves is then not appreciated. I3 can be applied to any document set and any citation window. The results of the integration (summation) are fully decomposable in terms of journals or instititutional units such as nations, universities, etc., because percentile ranks are determined at the paper level. In this study, we first compare I3 with IFs for the journals in two ISI Subject Categories ("Information Science &amp; Library Science" and "Multidisciplinary Sciences"). The LIS set is additionally decomposed in terms of nations. Policy implications of this possible paradigm shift in citation impact analysis are specified.',

	{'abstract': u'Learning and decision making in the brain are key processes critical to survival, and yet are processes implemented by non-ideal biological building blocks which can impose significant error. We explore quantitatively how the brain might cope with this inherent source of error by taking advantage of two ubiquitous mechanisms, redundancy and synchronization. In particular we consider a neural process whose goal is to learn a decision function by implementing a nonlinear gradient dynamics. The dynamics, however, are assumed to be corrupted by perturbations modeling the error which might be incurred due to limitations of the biology, intrinsic neuronal noise, and imperfect measurements. We show that error, and the associated uncertainty surrounding a learned solution, can be controlled in large part by trading off synchronization strength among multiple redundant neural systems against the noise amplitude. The impact of the coupling between such redundant systems is quantified by the spectrum of the network Laplacian, and we discuss the role of network topology in synchronization and in reducing the effect of noise. A range of situations in which the mechanisms we model arise in brain science are discussed, and we draw attention to experimental evidence suggesting that cortical circuits capable of implementing the computations of interest here can be found on several scales. Finally, simulations comparing theoretical bounds to the relevant empirical quantities show that the theoretical estimates we derive can be tight.',

	{'abstract': u'The richness of natural images makes the quest for optimal representations in image processing and computer vision challenging. The latter observation has not prevented the design of image representations, which trade off between efficiency and complexity, while achieving accurate rendering of smooth regions as well as reproducing faithful contours and textures. The most recent ones, proposed in the past decade, share an hybrid heritage highlighting the multiscale and oriented nature of edges and patterns in images. This paper presents a panorama of the aforementioned literature on decompositions in multiscale, multi-orientation bases or dictionaries. They typically exhibit redundancy to improve sparsity in the transformed domain and sometimes its invariance with respect to simple geometric deformations (translation, rotation). Oriented multiscale dictionaries extend traditional wavelet processing and may offer rotation invariance. Highly redundant dictionaries require specific algorithms to simplify the search for an efficient (sparse) representation. We also discuss the extension of multiscale geometric decompositions to non-Euclidean domains such as the sphere or arbitrary meshed surfaces. The etymology of panorama suggests an overview, based on a choice of partially overlapping "pictures". We hope that this paper will contribute to the appreciation and apprehension of a stream of current research directions in image understanding.',

	{'abstract': u'Recent studies have shown that a system composed from several randomly interdependent networks is extremely vulnerable to random failure. However, real interdependent networks are usually not randomly interdependent, rather a pair of dependent nodes are coupled according to some regularity which we coin inter-similarity. For example, we study a system composed from an interdependent world wide port network and a world wide airport network and show that well connected ports tend to couple with well connected airports. We introduce two quantities for measuring the level of inter-similarity between networks (i) Inter degree-degree correlation (IDDC) (ii) Inter-clustering coefficient (ICC). We then show both by simulation models and by analyzing the port-airport system that as the networks become more inter-similar the system becomes significantly more robust to random failure.',

	{'abstract': u'Current network models assume one type of links to define the relations between the network entities. However, many real networks can only be correctly described using two different types of relations. Connectivity links that enable the nodes to function cooperatively as a network and dependency links that bind the failure of one network element to the failure of other network elements. Here we present for the first time an analytical framework for studying the robustness of networks that include both connectivity and dependency links. We show that the synergy between the two types of failures leads to an iterative process of cascading failures that has a devastating effect on the network stability and completely alters the known assumptions regarding the robustness of networks. We present exact analytical results for the dramatic change in the network behavior when introducing dependency links. For a high density of dependency links the network disintegrates in a form of a first order phase transition while for a low density of dependency links the network disintegrates in a second order transition. Moreover, opposed to networks containing only connectivity links where a broader degree distribution results in a more robust network, when both types of links are present a broad degree distribution leads to higher vulnerability.',

Around forty thousands answers were collected across disciplines and around the world, showing an overwhelming support for the idea of open access, while highlighting funding and (perceived) quality as the main barriers to publishing in open access journals. This article serves as an introduction to the survey and presents this and other highlights from a preliminary analysis of the survey responses.

Computationally, this process is simple and easily implemented for the analysis of any network.

	{'abstract': u"Differential privacy is a notion of privacy that has become very popular in the database community. Roughly, the idea is that a randomized query mechanism provides sufficient privacy protection if the ratio between the probabilities that two adjacent datasets give the same answer is bound by e^epsilon. In the field of information flow there is a similar concern for controlling information leakage, i.e. limiting the possibility of inferring the secret information from the observables. In recent years, researchers have proposed to quantify the leakage in terms of R 'enyi min mutual information, a notion strictly related to the Bayes risk. In this paper, we show how to model the query system in terms of an information-theoretic channel, and we compare the notion of differential privacy with that of mutual information. We show that differential privacy implies a bound on the mutual information (but not vice-versa). Furthermore, we show that our bound is tight. Then, we consider the utility of the randomization mechanism, which represents how close the randomized answers are, in average, to the real ones. We show that the notion of differential privacy implies a bound on utility, also tight, and we propose a method that under certain conditions builds an optimal randomization mechanism, i.e. a mechanism which provides the best utility while guaranteeing differential privacy.",

	{'abstract': u"Network virtualization is an important concept to overcome the ossification of today's Internet as it facilitates innovation also in the network core and as it promises a more efficient use of the given resources and infrastructure. Virtual networks (VNets) provide an abstraction of the physical network: multiple VNets may cohabit the same physical network, but can be based on completely different protocol stacks (also beyond IP). One of the main challenges in network virtualization is the efficient admission control and embedding of VNets. The demand for virtual networks (e.g., for a video conference) can be hard to predict, and once the request is accepted, the specification / QoS guarantees must be ensured throughout the VNet's lifetime. This requires an admission control algorithm which only selects high-benefit VNets in times of scarce resources, and an embedding algorithm which realizes the VNet in such a way that the likelihood that future requests can be embedded as well is maximized. This article describes a generic algorithm for the online VNet embedding problem which does not rely on any knowledge of the future VNet requests but whose performance is competitive to an optimal offline algorithm that has complete knowledge of the request sequence in advance: the so-called competitive ratio is, loosely speaking, logarithmic in the sum of the resources. Our algorithm is generic in the sense that it supports multiple traffic models, multiple routing models, and even allows for nonuniform benefits and durations of VNet requests.",

	{'abstract': u'Differential privacy has recently emerged as the de facto standard for private data release. This makes it possible to provide strong theoretical guarantees on the privacy and utility of released data. While it is well-known how to release data based on counts and simple functions under this guarantee, it remains to provide general purpose techniques to release different kinds of data. In this paper, we focus on spatial data such as locations and more generally any data that can be indexed by a tree structure. Directly applying existing differential privacy methods to this type of data simply generates noise. Instead, we introduce a new class of "private spatial decompositions": these adapt standard spatial indexing methods such as quadtrees and kd-trees to provide a private description of the data distribution. Equipping such structures with differential privacy requires several steps to ensure that they provide meaningful privacy guarantees. Various primitives, such as choosing splitting points and describing the distribution of points within a region, must be done privately, and the guarantees of the different building blocks composed to provide an overall guarantee. Consequently, we expose the design space for private spatial decompositions, and analyze some key examples. Our experimental study demonstrates that it is possible to build such decompositions efficiently, and use them to answer a variety of queries privately with high accuracy.',

	{'abstract': u'Spectral analysis has been successfully applied at the detection of community structure of networks, respectively being based on the adjacency matrix, the standard Laplacian matrix, the normalized Laplacian matrix, the modularity matrix, the correlation matrix and several other variants of these matrices. However, the comparison between these spectral methods is less reported. More importantly, it is still unclear which matrix is more appropriate for the detection of community structure. This paper answers the question through evaluating the effectiveness of these five matrices against the benchmark networks with heterogeneous distributions of node degree and community size. Test results demonstrate that the normalized Laplacian matrix and the correlation matrix significantly outperform the other three matrices at identifying the community structure of networks. This indicates that it is crucial to take into account the heterogeneous distribution of node degree when using spectral analysis for the detection of community structure. In addition, to our surprise, the modularity matrix exhibits very similar performance to the adjacency matrix, which indicates that the modularity matrix does not gain desired benefits from using the configuration model as reference network with the consideration of the node degree heterogeneity.',

	{'abstract': u'The problem of broadcasting a parallel Gaussian source over an additive white Gaussian noise broadcast channel under the mean-squared error distortion criterion is studied. A hybrid digital-analog coding strategy which combines source coding with side information, channel coding with side information, layered source coding, and superposition broadcast channel coding is presented. When specialized to the open problem of broadcasting a white Gaussian source over an additive white Gaussian noise broadcast channel with bandwidth mismatch which has been the subject of several previous investigations, this coding scheme strictly improves on the state-of-the-art.',

	{'abstract': u'We show how to combine Bayes nets and game theory to predict the behavior of hybrid systems involving both humans and automated components. We call this novel framework "Semi Network-Form Games," and illustrate it by predicting aircraft pilot behavior in potential near mid-air collisions. At present, at the beginning of such potential collisions, a collision avoidance system in the aircraft cockpit advises the pilots what to do to avoid the collision. However studies of mid-air encounters have found wide variability in pilot responses to avoidance system advisories. In particular, pilots rarely perfectly execute the recommended maneuvers, despite the fact that the collision avoidance system\'s effectiveness relies on their doing so. Rather pilots decide their actions based on all information available to them (advisory, instrument readings, visual observations). We show how to build this aspect into a semi network-form game model of the encounter and then present computational simulations of the resultant model.',

	{'abstract': u'The fact that classical mathematical proofs of simply existential statements can be read as programs was established by Goedel and Kreisel half a century ago. But the possibility of extracting useful computational content from classical proofs was taken seriously only from the 1990s on when it was discovered that proof interpretations based on Goedel\'s and Kreisel\'s ideas can provide new nontrivial algorithms and numerical results, and the Curry-Howard correspondence can be extended to classical logic via programming concepts such as continuations and control operators. The workshop series "Classical Logic and Computation" aims to support a fruitful exchange of ideas between the various lines of research on computational aspects of classical logic. This volume contains the abstracts of the invited lectures and the accepted contributed papers of the third CL&amp;C workshop which was held jointly with the workshop "Program Extraction and Constructive Mathematics" at the University of Brno in August 21-22, 2010, as a satellite of CSL and MFCS. The workshops were held in honour of Helmut Schwichtenberg who became "professor emeritus" in September 2010. The topics of the papers include the foundations, optimizations and applications of proof interpretations such as Hilbert\'s epsilon substitution method, Goedel\'s functional interpretation, learning based realizability and negative translations as well as special calculi and theories capturing computational and complexity-theoretic aspects of classical logic such as the lambda-mu-calculus, applicative theories, sequent-calculi, resolution and cut-elimination',

	{'abstract': u'We develop a framework for computing two foundational analyses for concurrent higher-order programs: (control-)flow analysis (CFA) and may-happen-in-parallel analysis (MHP). We pay special attention to the unique challenges posed by the unrestricted mixture of first-class continuations and dynamically spawned threads. To set the stage, we formulate a concrete model of concurrent higher-order programs: the P(CEK*)S machine. We find that the systematic abstract interpretation of this machine is capable of computing both flow and MHP analyses. Yet, a closer examination finds that the precision for MHP is poor. As a remedy, we adapt a shape analytic technique-singleton abstraction-to dynamically spawned threads (as opposed to objects in the heap). We then show that if MHP analysis is not of interest, we can substantially accelerate the computation of flow analysis alone by collapsing thread interleavings with a second layer of abstraction.',

We generalize the method in [arXiv:1007.4338] by employing non-orthogonal measurements on the harmonic oscillator. This method can increase the probability of obtaining the factors by repeatedly using the nonlinear interactions between the oscillators and non-orthogonal measurements. However, this approach requires an exponential amount of resources for implementation. Thus, this method cannot provide a speed-up over classical algorithms unless its limitations are resolved.',

	{'abstract': u'This paper proposes a strict authentication watermarking for medical images. In this scheme, we define region of interest (ROI) by taking the smallest rectangle around an image. The watermark is generated from hashing the area of interest. The embedding region is considered to be outside the region of interest as to preserve the area from distortion as a result from watermarking. The strict authentication watermarking is robust to some degree of JPEG compression (SAW-JPEG). JPEG compression will be reviewed. To embed a watermark in the spatial domain, we have to make sure that the embedded watermark will survive JPEG quantization process. The watermarking scheme, including data embedding, extracting and verifying procedure were presented. Experimental results showed that such a scheme could embed and extract the watermark at a high compression rate. The watermark is robust to a high compression rate up to 90.6%. The JPEG image quality threshold is 60 for the least significant bit embedding. The image quality threshold is increased to 61 for 2nd and 3rd LSB manipulations.',

	{'abstract': u"As a major part of the daily operation in an enterprise, purchasing frequency is of constant change. Recent approaches on the human dynamics can provide some new insights into the economic behaviors of companies in the supply chain. This paper captures the attributes of creation times of purchase orders to an individual vendor, as well as to all vendors, and further investigates whether they have some kind of dynamics by applying logarithmic binning to the construction of distribution plot. It's found that the former displays a power-law distribution with approximate exponent 2.0, while the latter is fitted by a mixture distribution with both power-law and exponential characteristics. Obviously, two distinctive characteristics are presented for the interval time distribution from the perspective of individual dynamics and group dynamics. Actually, this mixing feature can be attributed to the fitting deviations as they are negligible for individual dynamics, but those of different vendors are cumulated and then lead to an exponential factor for group dynamics. To better describe the mechanism generating the heterogeneity of purchase order assignment process from the objective company to all its vendors, a model driven by product life cycle is introduced, and then the analytical distribution and the simulation result are obtained, which are in good line with the empirical data.",

	{'abstract': u'Since its introduction by Erik Winfree in 1998, the abstract Tile Assembly Model (aTAM) has inspired a wealth of research. As an abstract model for tile based self-assembly, it has proven to be remarkably powerful and expressive in terms of the structures which can self-assemble within it. As research has progressed in the aTAM, the self-assembling structures being studied have become progressively more complex. This increasing complexity, along with a need for standardization of definitions and tools among researchers, motivated the development of the Iowa State University Tile Assembly Simulator (ISU TAS). ISU TAS is a graphical simulator and tile set editor for designing and building 2-D and 3-D aTAM tile assembly systems and simulating their self-assembly. This paper reviews the features and functionality of ISU TAS and describes how it can be used to further research into the complexities of the aTAM.

	{'abstract': u'Consider a sensor network made of remote nodes connected to a common fusion center. In a recent work Blum and Sadler [1] propose the idea of ordered transmissions -sensors with more informative samples deliver their messages first- and prove that optimal detection performance can be achieved using only a subset of the total messages. Taking to one extreme this approach, we show that just a single delivering allows making the detection errors as small as desired, for a sufficiently large network size: a one-bit detection scheme can be asymptotically consistent. The transmission ordering is based on the modulus of some local statistic (MO system). We derive analytical results proving the asymptotic consistency and, for the particular case that the local statistic is the log-likelihood ( ell-MO system), we also obtain a bound on the error convergence rate. All the theorems are proved under the general setup of random number of sensors. Computer experiments corroborate the analysis and address typical examples of applications including: non-homogeneous Poisson-deployed networks, detection by per-sensor censoring, monitoring of energy-constrained phenomenon.',

	{'abstract': u'Modern scientific data mainly consist of huge datasets gathered by a very large number of techniques and stored in very diversified and often incompatible data repositories. More in general, in the e-science environment, it is considered as a critical and urgent requirement to integrate services across distributed, heterogeneous, dynamic "virtual organizations" formed by different resources within a single enterprise. In the last decade, Astronomy has become an immensely data rich field due to the evolution of detectors (plates to digital to mosaics), telescopes and space instruments. The Virtual Observatory approach consists into the federation under common standards of all astronomical archives available worldwide, as well as data analysis, data mining and data exploration applications. The main drive behind such effort being that once the infrastructure will be completed, it will allow a new type of multi-wavelength, multi-epoch science which can only be barely imagined. Data Mining, or Knowledge Discovery in Databases, while being the main methodology to extract the scientific information contained in such MDS (Massive Data Sets), poses crucial problems since it has to orchestrate complex problems posed by transparent access to different computing environments, scalability of algorithms, reusability of resources, etc. In the present paper we summarize the present status of the MDS in the Virtual Observatory and what is currently done and planned to bring advanced Data Mining methodologies in the case of the DAME (DAta Mining &amp; Exploration) project.',

	{'abstract': u'Fractional frequency reuse (FFR) is an interference management technique well-suited to OFDMA-based cellular networks wherein the cells are partitioned into spatial regions with different frequency reuse factors. To date, FFR techniques have been typically been evaluated through system-level simulations using a hexagonal grid for the base station locations. This paper instead focuses on analytically evaluating the two main types of FFR deployments - Strict FFR and Soft Frequency Reuse (SFR) - using a Poisson point process to model the base station locations. The results are compared with the standard grid model and an actual urban deployment. Under reasonable special cases for modern cellular networks, our results reduce to simple closed-form expressions, which provide insight into system design guidelines and the relative merits of Strict FFR, SFR, universal reuse, and fixed frequency reuse. We observe that FFR provides an increase in the sum-rate as well as the well-known benefit of improved coverage for cell-edge users. Finally, a SINR-proportional resource allocation strategy is proposed based on the analytical expressions, showing that Strict FFR provides greater overall network throughput at low traffic loads, while SFR better balances the requirements of interference reduction and resource efficiency when the traffic load is high.',

	{'abstract': u'Consider the emph (SRC) which consists of a set of relay channels where the source wishes to transmit common and private information to each of the destinations. This problem is recognized as being equivalent to that of sending common and private information to several destinations in presence of helper relays where each channel outcome becomes a branch of the emph (BRC). Cooperative schemes and capacity region for a set with two memoryless relay channels are investigated. The proposed coding schemes, based on emph (DF) and emph (CF) must be capable of transmitting information simultaneously to all destinations in such set. Depending on the quality of source-to-relay and relay-to-destination channels, inner bounds on the capacity of the general BRC are derived. Three cases of particular interest are considered: cooperation is based on DF strategy for both users --referred to as DF-DF region--, cooperation is based on CF strategy for both users --referred to as CF-CF region--, and cooperation is based on DF strategy for one destination and CF for the other --referred to as DF-CF region--. These results can be seen as a generalization and hence unification of previous works. An outer-bound on the capacity of the general BRC is also derived. Capacity results are obtained for the specific cases of semi-degraded and degraded Gaussian simultaneous relay channels. Rates are evaluated for Gaussian models where the source must guarantee a minimum amount of information to both users while additional information is sent to each of them.',

	{'abstract': u'We study the community structure of networks representing voting on resolutions in the United Nations General Assembly. We construct networks from the voting records of the separate annual sessions between 1946 and 2008 in three different ways: (1) by considering voting similarities as weighted unipartite networks; (2) by considering voting similarities as weighted, signed unipartite networks; and (3) by examining signed bipartite networks in which countries are connected to resolutions. For each formulation, we detect communities by optimizing network modularity using an appropriate null model. We compare and contrast the results that we obtain for these three different network representations. In so doing, we illustrate the need to consider multiple resolution parameters and explore the effectiveness of each network representation for identifying voting groups amidst the large amount of agreement typical in General Assembly votes.',

	{'abstract': u'Digital watermarking technique has been presented and widely researched to solve some important issues in the digital world, such as copyright protection, copy protection and content authentication. Several robust watermarking schemes based on vector quantization (VQ) have been presented. In this paper, we present a new digital image watermarking method based on SOFM vector quantizer for color images. This method utilizes the codebook partition technique in which the watermark bit is embedded into the selected VQ encoded block. The main feature of this scheme is that the watermark exists both in VQ compressed image and in the reconstructed image. The watermark extraction can be performed without the original image. The watermark is hidden inside the compressed image, so much transmission time and storage space can be saved when the compressed data are transmitted over the Internet. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method has robustness against various image processing operations without sacrificing compression performance and the computational speed.',

We introduce a model whose topology interpolates between the one-dimensional euclidean lattice (a ring) and the complete graph by changing the value of one parameter (the probability p to add a link between two nodes not already connected in the euclidean configuration). We show that there is a region of values of p in which cooperation is largely enhanced, whilst for smaller values of p only a few cooperators are present in the final state, and for p rightarrow 1- cooperation is totally suppressed.

By extending the results by Chow and Liu on dependence tree approximations, we show that the best causal dependence tree approximation is the one which maximizes the sum of directed informations on its edges, where best is defined in terms of minimizing the KL-divergence between the original and the approximate distribution. Moreover, we describe a low-complexity algorithm to efficiently pick this approximate distribution.',

The prosperity of software radio has motivated us to investigate the implementation of LDPC decoders on processors. In this paper, we estimate and compare complexity and power consumption of LDPC decoding algorithms running on general purpose processors. Using the estimation results, we show two power control schemes for software radio: SNR-based algorithm diversity and joint transmit power and receiver energy management. Overall, this paper discusses general concerns about using processors as the software radio platform for the implementation of LDPC decoders.',

We find that the interevent time distributions of bookmarking decays powerlike as interevent time increases at both individual and population level. Remarkably, we observe a significant change in the exponent when interevent time increases from intra-day to inter-day range. In addition, dependence of exponent on individual Activity is found to be different in the two ranges. These results suggests that mechanisms driving human actions are different in intra- and inter-day range. Instead of monotonically increasing with Activity, we find that inter-day exponent peaks at value around 3. We further show that less active users are more likely to resemble poisson process in bookmarking. Based on the temporal-preference model, preliminary explanations for this dependence have been given . Finally, a universal behavior in inter-day scale is observed by considering the rescaled variable.',

Contrary to existing multiple-membership models that scale quadratically in the number of vertices the proposed model scales linearly in the number of links admitting multiple-membership analysis in large scale networks.

	{'abstract': u"We consider the problem of broadcasting a viral video (a large file) over an ad hoc wireless network (e.g., students in a campus). Many smartphones are GPS enabled, and equipped with peer-to-peer (ad hoc) transmission mode, allowing them to wirelessly exchange files over short distances rather than use the carrier's WAN. The demand for the file however is transmitted through the social network (e.g., a YouTube link posted on Facebook). To address this coupled-network problem (demand on the social network; bandwidth on the wireless network) where the two networks have different topologies, we propose a file dissemination algorithm. In our scheme, users query their social network to find geographically nearby friends that have the desired file, and utilize the underlying ad hoc network to route the data via multi-hop transmissions. We show that for many popular models for social networks, the file dissemination time scales sublinearly with n; the number of users, compared to the linear scaling required if each user who wants the file must download it from the carrier's WAN.",

Each correspondent is distributed a different disposable home address. If attacked on a given home address, the mobile user can block packets to that address and become unreachable to the attacker. Blocking one address does not affect other addresses. Other correspondents can still reach the mobile host. A new home address can also be requested via e-mail, instant messaging, or directly from the target host using a protocol that we develop. This model is especially useful against battery exhausting Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks and CPU exhausting distributed DoS attacks, since it seems to be the only viable solution, currently. We show however that this model can also be used to defeat other attacks and also to stop spam.',

	{'abstract': u"We consider the problem of learning about and comparing the consequences of dynamic treatment strategies on the basis of observational data. We formulate this within a probabilistic decision-theoretic framework. Our approach is compared with related work by Robins and others: in particular, we show how Robins's 'G-computation' algorithm arises naturally from this decision-theoretic perspective. Careful attention is paid to the mathematical and substantive conditions required to justify the use of this formula. These conditions revolve around a property we term stability, which relates the probabilistic behaviours of observational and interventional regimes. We show how an assumption of 'sequential randomization' (or 'no unmeasured confounders'), or an alternative assumption of 'sequential irrelevance', can be used to infer stability. Probabilistic influence diagrams are used to simplify manipulations, and their power and limitations are discussed. We compare our approach with alternative formulations based on causal DAGs or potential response models. We aim to show that formulating the problem of assessing dynamic treatment strategies as a problem of decision analysis brings clarity, simplicity and generality.",

	{'abstract': u'We present data-oblivious algorithms in the external-memory model for compaction, selection, and sorting. Motivation for such problems comes from clients who use outsourced data storage services and wish to mask their data access patterns. We show that compaction and selection can be done data-obliviously using I/Os, and sorting can be done, with a high probability of success, using I/Os. Our methods use a number of new algorithmic techniques, including data-oblivious uses of invertible Bloom lookup tables, a butterfly-like compression network, randomized data thinning, and "shuffle-and-deal" data perturbation. In addition, since data-oblivious sorting is the bottleneck in the "inner loop" in existing oblivious RAM simulations, our sorting result improves the amortized time overhead to do oblivious RAM simulation by a logarithmic factor in the external-memory model.',

	{'abstract': u'It is well known that the spectral radius of a tree whose maximum degree is D cannot exceed 2sqrt. Similar upper bound holds for arbitrary planar graphs, whose spectral radius cannot exceed sqrt+10, and more generally, for all d-degenerate graphs, where the corresponding upper bound is sqrt. Following this, we say that a graph G is spectrally d-degenerate if every subgraph H of G has spectral radius at most sqrt. In this paper we derive a rough converse of the above-mentioned results by proving that each spectrally d-degenerate graph G contains a vertex whose degree is at most 4dlog_2(D/d) (if D&gt;=2d). It is shown that the dependence on D in this upper bound cannot be eliminated, as long as the dependence on d is subexponential. It is also proved that the problem of deciding if a graph is spectrally d-degenerate is co-NP-complete.',

	{'abstract': u'This article presents a model which is capable of learning and abstracting new concepts based on comparing observations and finding the resemblance between the observations. In the model, the new observations are compared with the templates which have been derived from the previous experiences. In the first stage, the objects are first represented through a geometric description which is used for finding the object boundaries and a descriptor which is inspired by the human visual system and then they are fed into the model. Next, the new observations are identified through comparing them with the previously-learned templates and are used for producing new templates. The comparisons are made based on measures like Euclidean or correlation distance. The new template is created by applying onion-pealing algorithm. The algorithm consecutively uses convex hulls which are made by the points representing the objects. If the new observation is remarkably similar to one of the observed categories, it is no longer utilized in creating a new template. The existing templates are used to provide a description of the new observation. This description is provided in the templates space. Each template represents a dimension of the feature space. The degree of the resemblance each template bears to each object indicates the value associated with the object in that dimension of the templates space. In this way, the description of the new observation becomes more accurate and detailed as the time passes and the experiences increase. We have used this model for learning and recognizing the new polygons in the polygon space. Representing the polygons was made possible through employing a geometric method and a method inspired by human visual system. Various implementations of the model have been compared. The evaluation results of the model prove its efficiency in learning and deriving new templates.',

	{'abstract': u'The order statistics based list decoding techniques for linear binary block codes of small to medium block length are investigated. The construction of the list of the test error patterns is considered. The original order statistics decoding is generalized by assuming segmentation of the most reliable independent positions of the received bits. The segmentation is shown to overcome several drawbacks of the original order statistics decoding. The complexity of the order statistics based decoding is further reduced by assuming a partial ordering of the received bits in order to avoid the complex Gauss elimination. The probability of the test error patterns in the decoding list is derived. The bit error rate performance and the decoding complexity trade-off of the proposed decoding algorithms is studied by computer simulations. Numerical examples show that, in some cases, the proposed decoding schemes are superior to the original order statistics decoding in terms of both the bit error rate performance as well as the decoding complexity.',

More precisely we study the effect of cost policies used by these resources in the convergence time to a pure Nash equilibrium. The work is divided in two parts. In the theoretical part we prove lower and upper bounds on the convergence time for various cost policies. We then implement all the models we study and provide some experimental results. These results follows the theoretical with one exception which is the most interesting among the experiments. In the case of coalitional users the theoretical upper bound is pseudo-polynomial to the number of users but the experimental results shows that the convergence time is polynomial.',

We present a core calculus, System D, that merges these two modes of reasoning into a single powerful mechanism of nested refinement types wherein the typing relation is itself a predicate in the refinement logic. System D coordinates SMT-based logical implication and syntactic subtyping to automatically typecheck sophisticated dynamic language programs. By coupling nested refinements with McCarthy's theory of finite maps, System D can precisely reason about the interaction of higher-order functions, polymorphism, and dictionaries. The addition of type predicates to the refinement logic creates a circularity that leads to unique technical challenges in the metatheory, which we solve with a novel stratification approach that we use to prove the soundness of System D.",

	{'abstract': u'In this paper, we propose an opportunistic buffered decode-wait-and-forward (OBDWF) protocol to exploit both relay buffering and relay mobility to enhance the system throughput and the end-to-end packet delay under bursty arrivals. We consider a point-to-point communication link assisted by K mobile relays. We illustrate that the OBDWF protocol could achieve a better throughput and delay performance compared with existing baseline systems such as the conventional dynamic decode-and-forward (DDF) and amplified-and-forward (AF) protocol. In addition to simulation performance, we also derived closed-form asymptotic throughput and delay expressions of the OBDWF protocol. Specifically, the proposed OBDWF protocol achieves an asymptotic throughput O(logK) with O(1) total transmit power in the relay network. This is a significant gain compared with the best known performance in conventional protocols (O(logK) throughput with O(K) total transmit power). With bursty arrivals, we show that both the stability region and average delay of the proposed OBDWF protocol can achieve order-wise performance gain O(K) compared with conventional DDF protocol.',

	{'abstract': u'A probabilistic cellular automaton (PCA) can be viewed as a Markov chain. The cells are updated synchronously and independently, according to a distribution depending on a finite neighborhood. We investigate the ergodicity of this Markov chain. A classical cellular automaton is a particular case of PCA. For a 1-dimensional cellular automaton, we prove that ergodicity is equivalent to nilpotency, and is therefore undecidable. We then propose an efficient perfect sampling algorithm for the invariant measure of an ergodic PCA. Our algorithm does not assume any monotonicity property of the local rule. It is based on a bounding process which is shown to be also a PCA. Last, we focus on the PCA Majority, whose asymptotic behavior is unknown, and perform numerical experiments using the perfect sampling procedure.',

	{'abstract': u'With the forecast increase in air traffic demand over the next decades, it is imperative to develop tools to provide traffic flow managers with the information required to support decision making. In particular, decision-support tools for traffic flow management should aid in limiting controller workload and complexity, while supporting increases in air traffic throughput. While many decision-support tools exist for short-term traffic planning, few have addressed the strategic needs for medium- and long-term planning for time horizons greater than 30 minutes. This paper seeks to address this gap through the introduction of 3D aircraft proximity maps that evaluate the future probability of presence of at least one or two aircraft at any given point of the airspace. Three types of proximity maps are presented: presence maps that indicate the local density of traffic; conflict maps that determine locations and probabilities of potential conflicts; and outliers maps that evaluate the probability of conflict due to aircraft not belonging to dominant traffic patterns. These maps provide traffic flow managers with information relating to the complexity and difficulty of managing an airspace. The intended purpose of the maps is to anticipate how aircraft flows will interact, and how outliers impact the dominant traffic flow for a given time period. This formulation is able to predict which "critical" regions may be subject to conflicts between aircraft, thereby requiring careful monitoring. These probabilities are computed using a generative aircraft flow model. Time-varying flow characteristics, such as geometrical configuration, speed, and probability density function of aircraft spatial distribution within the flow, are determined from archived Enhanced Traffic Management System data, using a tailored clustering algorithm. Aircraft not belonging to flows are identified as outliers.',

	{'abstract': u'Research shows that comment spamming (comments which are unsolicited, unrelated, abusive, hateful, commercial advertisements etc) in online discussion forums has become a common phenomenon in Web 2.0 applications and there is a strong need to counter or combat comment spamming. We present a method to automatically detect comment spammer in YouTube (largest and a popular video sharing website) forums. The proposed technique is based on mining comment activity log of a user and extracting patterns (such as time interval between subsequent comments, presence of exactly same comment across multiple unrelated videos) indicating spam behavior. We perform empirical analysis on data crawled from YouTube and demonstrate that the proposed method is effective for the task of comment spammer detection.',

	{'abstract': u'A general relation for the dependence of nearest neighbor degree correlations on degree is derived. Dependence of local clustering on degree is shown to be the sole determining factor of assortative versus disassortative mixing in networks. The characteristics of networks derived from spatial atomic/molecular systems exemplified by self-organized residue networks and block copolymers, atomic clusters and well-compressed polymeric melts are studied. Distributions of statistical properties of the networks are presented. For these densely-packed systems, assortative mixing in the network construction is found to apply, and conditions are derived for a simple linear dependence. Together, these measures (i) reveal patterns that are common to close-packed clusters of atoms/molecules, (ii) identify the type of surface effects prominent in different systems, and (iii) associate fingerprints that may be used to classify networks with varying types of correlations.',

	{'abstract': u'Higher-order recursion schemes are recursive equations defining new operations from given ones called "terminals". Every such recursion scheme is proved to have a least interpreted semantics in every Scott\'s model of lambda-calculus in which the terminals are interpreted as continuous operations. For the uninterpreted semantics based on infinite lambda-terms we follow the idea of Fiore, Plotkin and Turi and work in the category of sets in context, which are presheaves on the category of finite sets. Fiore et al showed how to capture the type of variable binding in lambda-calculus by an endofunctor H lambda and they explained simultaneous substitution of lambda-terms by proving that the presheaf of lambda-terms is an initial H lambda-monoid. Here we work with the presheaf of rational infinite lambda-terms and prove that this is an initial iterative H lambda-monoid. We conclude that every guarded higher-order recursion scheme has a unique uninterpreted solution in this monoid.',

	{'abstract': u'Understanding how users tailor their SPARQL queries is crucial when designing query evaluation engines or fine-tuning RDF stores with performance in mind. In this paper we analyze 3 million real-world SPARQL queries extracted from logs of the DBPedia and SWDF public endpoints. We aim at finding which are the most used language elements both from syntactical and structural perspectives, paying special attention to triple patterns and joins, since they are indeed some of the most expensive SPARQL operations at evaluation phase. We have determined that most of the queries are simple and include few triple patterns and joins, being Subject-Subject, Subject-Object and Object-Object the most common join types. The graph patterns are usually star-shaped and despite triple pattern chains exist, they are generally short.',

	{'abstract': u'Hybrid learning methods use theoretical knowledge of a domain and a set of classified examples to develop a method for classification. Methods that use domain knowledge have been shown to perform better than inductive learners. However, there is no general method to include domain knowledge into all inductive learning algorithms as all hybrid methods are highly specialized for a particular algorithm. We present an algorithm that will take domain knowledge in the form of propositional rules, generate artificial examples from the rules and also remove instances likely to be flawed. This enriched dataset then can be used by any learning algorithm. Experimental results of different scenarios are shown that demonstrate this method to be more effective than simple inductive learning.',

	{'abstract': u'The location determination in obstructed area can be very challenging especially if Global Positioning System are blocked. Users will find it difficult to navigate directly on-site in such condition, especially indoor car park lot or obstructed environment. Sometimes, it needs to combine with other sensors and positioning methods in order to determine the location with more intelligent, reliable and ubiquity. By using ubiquitous positioning in mobile navigation system, it is a promising ubiquitous location technique in a mobile phone since as it is a familiar personal electronic device for many people. However, as research on ubiquitous positioning systems goes beyond basic methods there is an increasing need for better comparison of proposed ubiquitous positioning systems. System developers are also lacking of good frameworks for understanding different options during building ubiquitous positioning systems. This paper proposes taxonomy to address both of these problems. The proposed taxonomy has been constructed from a literature study of papers and articles on positioning estimation that can be used to determine location everywhere on mobile navigation system. For researchers the taxonomy can also be used as an aid for scoping out future research in the area of ubiquitous positioning.',

	{'abstract': u'Different features have different relevance to a particular learning problem. Some features are less relevant; while some very important. Instead of selecting the most relevant features using feature selection, an algorithm can be given this knowledge of feature importance based on expert opinion or prior learning. Learning can be faster and more accurate if learners take feature importance into account. Correlation aided Neural Networks (CANN) is presented which is such an algorithm. CANN treats feature importance as the correlation coefficient between the target attribute and the features. CANN modifies normal feed-forward Neural Network to fit both correlation values and training data. Empirical evaluation shows that CANN is faster and more accurate than applying the two step approach of feature selection and then using normal learning algorithms.',

	{'abstract': u'The existence of quantum uncertainty relations is the essential reason that some classically impossible cryptographic primitives become possible when quantum communication is allowed. One direct operational manifestation of these uncertainty relations is a purely quantum effect referred to as information locking. A locking scheme can be viewed as a cryptographic protocol in which a uniformly random n-bit message is encoded in a quantum system using a classical key of size much smaller than n. Without the key, no measurement of this quantum state can extract more than a negligible amount of information about the message, in which case the message is said to be "locked". Furthermore, knowing the key, it is possible to recover, that is "unlock", the message. In this paper, we make the following contributions by exploiting a connection between uncertainty relations and low-distortion embeddings of L2 into L1. We introduce the notion of metric uncertainty relations and connect it to low-distortion embeddings of L2 into L1. A metric uncertainty relation also implies an entropic uncertainty relation. We prove that random bases satisfy uncertainty relations with a stronger definition and better parameters than previously known. Our proof is also considerably simpler than earlier proofs. We apply this result to show the existence of locking schemes with key size independent of the message length. We give efficient constructions of metric uncertainty relations. The bases defining these metric uncertainty relations are computable by quantum circuits of almost linear size. This leads to the first explicit construction of a strong information locking scheme. Moreover, we present a locking scheme that is close to being implementable with current technology. We apply our metric uncertainty relations to exhibit communication protocols that perform quantum equality testing.',

The assumption is that we are dealing with a large Web site providing content to a large number of users accessing the site. The proposed approach represents each user by a set of features derived from the different data sources, where some feature values may be missing for some users. It further enables user modeling based on the provided characteristics of the targeted user subset. The approach is evaluated on real-world data where we compare performance of the automatic assignment of a user to a predefined user segment when different data sources are used to represent the users.',

	{'abstract': u'The hairpin completion is an operation on formal languages which is inspired by the hairpin formation in biochemistry. Hairpin formations occur naturally within DNA-computing. It has been known that the hairpin completion of a regular language is linear context-free, but not regular, in general. However, for some time it is was open whether the regularity of the hairpin completion of a regular language is is decidable. In 2009 this decidability problem has been solved positively by providing a polynomial time algorithm. In this paper we improve the complexity bound by showing that the decision problem is actually NL-complete. This complexity bound holds for both, the one-sided and the two-sided hairpin completions.',

	{'abstract': u'The model checking problem for CTL is known to be P-complete (Clarke, Emerson, and Sistla (1986), see Schnoebelen (2002)). We consider fragments of CTL obtained by restricting the use of temporal modalities or the use of negations---restrictions already studied for LTL by Sistla and Clarke (1985) and Markey (2004). For all these fragments, except for the trivial case without any temporal operator, we systematically prove model checking to be either inherently sequential (P-complete) or very efficiently parallelizable (LOGCFL-complete). For most fragments, however, model checking for CTL is already P-complete. Hence our results indicate that, in cases where the combined complexity is of relevance, approaching CTL model checking by parallelism cannot be expected to result in any significant speedup. We also completely determine the complexity of the model checking problem for all fragments of the extensions ECTL, CTL+, and ECTL+.',

	{'abstract': u"Is it possible to abstract a formal mechanism originating schisms and governing the size evolution of social conversations? In this work a constructive solution to such problem is proposed: an abstract model of a generic N-party turn-taking conversation. The model develops from simple yet realistic assumptions derived from experimental evidence, abstracts from conversation content and semantics while including topological information, and is driven by stochastic dynamics. We find that a single mechanism - namely the dynamics of conversational party's individual fitness, as related to conversation size - controls the development of the self-organized schisming phenomenon. Potential generalizations of the model - including individual traits and preferences, memory effects and more elaborated conversational topologies - may find important applications also in other fields of research, where dynamically-interacting and networked agents play a fundamental role.",

	{'abstract': u'This paper investigates the optimum source transmission strategy to maximize the capacity of a multiple-input single-output (MISO) amplify-and-forward relay channel, assuming source-relay channel mean feedback at the source. The challenge here is that relaying introduces a nonconvex structure in the objective function, thereby excluding the possible use of previous methods dealing with mean feedback that generally rely on the concavity of the objective function. A novel method is employed, which divides the feasible set into two subsets and establishes the optimum from one of them by comparison. As such, the optimization is transformed into the comparison of two nonnegative random variables in the Laplace transform order, which is one of the important stochastic orders. It turns out that the optimum transmission strategy is to transmit along the known channel mean and its orthogonal eigenchannels. The condition for rank-one precoding (beamforming) to achieve capacity is also determined. Our results subsume those for traditional MISO precoding with mean feedback.',

	{'abstract': u'Compressed sensing is a technique for finding sparse solutions to underdetermined linear systems. This technique relies on properties of the sensing matrix such as the restricted isometry property. Sensing matrices that satisfy the restricted isometry property with optimal parameters are mainly obtained via probabilistic arguments. Given any matrix, deciding whether it satisfies the restricted isometry property is a non-trivial computational problem. In this paper, we give reductions from dense subgraph problems to the certification of the restricted isometry property. This gives evidence that certifying the restricted isometry property is unlikely to be feasible in polynomial-time. Moreover, on the positive side we propose an improvement on the brute-force enumeration algorithm for checking the restricted isometry property. Another contribution of independent interest is a spectral algorithm for certifying that a random graph does not contain any dense k-subgraph. This "skewed spectral algorithm" performs better than the basic spectral algorithm in a certain range of parameters.',

	{'abstract': u'We present a simple and efficient variational finite difference method for simulating time-dependent Stokes flow in the presence of irregular free surfaces and moving solid boundaries. The method uses an embedded boundary approach on staggered Cartesian grids, avoiding the need for expensive remeshing operations, and can be applied to flows in both two and three dimensions. It uses fully implicit backwards Euler integration to provide stability and supports spatially varying density and viscosity, while requiring the solution of just a single sparse, symmetric positive-definite linear system per time step. By expressing the problem in a variational form, challenging irregular domains are supported implicitly through the use of natural boundary conditions. In practice, the discretization requires only centred finite difference stencils and per-cell volume fractions, and is straightforward to implement. The variational form further permits generalizations to coupling other mechanics, all the while reducing to a sparse symmetric positive definite matrix. We demonstrate consistent first order convergence of velocity in L1 and Linf norms on a range of analytical test cases in two dimensions. Furthermore, we apply our method as part of a simple Navier-Stokes solver to illustrate that it can reproduce the characteristic jet buckling phenomenon of Newtonian liquids at moderate viscosities, in both two and three dimensions.',

	{'abstract': u'Game semantics describe the interactive behavior of proofs by interpreting formulas as games on which proofs induce strategies. Such a semantics is introduced here for capturing dependencies induced by quantifications in first-order propositional logic. One of the main difficulties that has to be faced during the elaboration of this kind of semantics is to characterize definable strategies, that is strategies which actually behave like a proof. This is usually done by restricting the model to strategies satisfying subtle combinatorial conditions, whose preservation under composition is often difficult to show. Here, we present an original methodology to achieve this task, which requires to combine advanced tools from game semantics, rewriting theory and categorical algebra. We introduce a diagrammatic presentation of the monoidal category of definable strategies of our model, by the means of generators and relations: those strategies can be generated from a finite set of atomic strategies and the equality between strategies admits a finite axiomatization, this equational structure corresponding to a polarized variation of the notion of bialgebra. This work thus bridges algebra and denotational semantics in order to reveal the structure of dependencies induced by first-order quantifiers, and lays the foundations for a mechanized analysis of causality in programming languages.',

	{'abstract': u'Link prediction is an open problem in the complex network, which attracts much research interest currently. However, little attention has been paid to the relation between network structure and the performance of prediction methods. In order to fill this vital gap, we try to understand how the network structure affects the performance of link prediction methods in the view of clustering. Our experiments on both synthetic and real-world networks show that as the clustering grows, the precision of these methods could be improved remarkably, while for the sparse and weakly clustered network, they perform poorly. We explain this through the distinguishment caused by increased clustering between the score distribution of positive and negative instances. Our finding also sheds light on the problem of how to select appropriate approaches for different networks with various densities and clusterings.',

	{'abstract': u'High-dimensional statistical inference deals with models in which the the number of parameters p is comparable to or larger than the sample size n. Since it is usually impossible to obtain consistent procedures unless , a line of recent work has studied models with various types of low-dimensional structure, including sparse vectors, sparse and structured matrices, low-rank matrices and combinations thereof. In such settings, a general approach to estimation is to solve a regularized optimization problem, which combines a loss function measuring how well the model fits the data with some regularization function that encourages the assumed structure. This paper provides a unified framework for establishing consistency and convergence rates for such regularized M-estimators under high-dimensional scaling. We state one main theorem and show how it can be used to re-derive some existing results, and also to obtain a number of new results on consistency and convergence rates, in both -error and related norms. Our analysis also identifies two key properties of loss and regularization functions, referred to as restricted strong convexity and decomposability, that ensure corresponding regularized M-estimators have fast convergence rates and which are optimal in many well-studied cases.',

	{'abstract': u'The paper presents Multi-Level Steganography (MLS), which defines a new concept for hidden communication in telecommunication networks. In MLS, at least two steganographic methods are utilised simultaneously, in such a way that one method (called the upper-level) serves as a carrier for the second one (called the lower-level). Such a relationship between two (or more) information hiding solutions has several potential benefits. The most important is that the lower-level method steganographic bandwidth can be utilised to make the steganogram unreadable even after the detection of the upper-level method: e.g., it can carry a cryptographic key that deciphers the steganogram carried by the upper-level one. It can also be used to provide the steganogram with integrity. Another important benefit is that the lower-layer method may be used as a signalling channel in which to exchange information that affects the way that the upper-level method functions, thus possibly making the steganographic communication harder to detect. The prototype of MLS for IP networks was also developed, and the experimental results are included in this paper.',

	{'abstract': u'In this paper, we propose an efficient mobility control algorithm for the downlink multi-cell orthogonal frequency division multiplexing access (OFDMA) system for co-channel interference reduction. It divides each cell into several areas. The mobile nodes in each area find their own optimal position according to their present location. Both the signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR) and the capacity for each node are increased by the proposed mobility control algorithm. Simulation results say that, even the frequency reuse factor (FRF) is equal to 1, the average capacity is improved after applying the mobility control algorithm, compared to existing partial frequency reuse (PFR) scheme.',

Its dual constructs a high entropy distribution upon which weak learners and training labels are uncorrelated. This manuscript studies this primal-dual relationship under a broad family of losses, including the exponential loss of AdaBoost and the logistic loss, revealing: - Weak learnability aids the whole loss family: for any &gt;0, O(ln(1/)) iterations suffice to produce a predictor with empirical risk -close to the infimum; - The circumstances granting the existence of an empirical risk minimizer may be characterized in terms of the primal and dual problems, yielding a new proof of the known rate O(ln(1/)); - Arbitrary instances may be decomposed into the above two, granting rate O(1/), with a matching lower bound provided for the logistic loss.',

	{'abstract': u"Cooperation is of utmost importance to society as a whole, but is often challenged by individual self-interests. While game theory has studied this problem extensively, there is little work on interactions within and across groups with different preferences or beliefs. Yet, people from different social or cultural backgrounds often meet and interact. This can yield conflict, since behavior that is considered cooperative by one population might be perceived as non-cooperative from the viewpoint of another. To understand the dynamics and outcome of the competitive interactions within and between groups, we study game-dynamical replicator equations for multiple populations with incompatible interests and different power (be this due to different population sizes, material resources, social capital, or other factors). These equations allow us to address various important questions: For example, can cooperation in the prisoner's dilemma be promoted, when two interacting groups have different preferences? Under what conditions can costly punishment, or other mechanisms, foster the evolution of norms? When does cooperation fail, leading to antagonistic behavior, conflict, or even revolutions? And what incentives are needed to reach peaceful agreements between groups with conflicting interests? Our detailed quantitative analysis reveals a large variety of interesting results, which are relevant for society, law and economics, and have implications for the evolution of language and culture as well.",

We suggest that the set of citing papers can be considered as the relevant representation of the field of impact. In order to normalize for differences in citation behavior among fields, citations can be fractionally counted proportionately to the length of the reference lists in the citing papers. This new method enables us to compare among units with different disciplinary affiliations at the paper level and also to assess the statistical significance of differences among sets. Twenty-seven departments of the Tsinghua University in Beijing are thus compared. Among them, the Department of Chinese Language and Linguistics is upgraded from the 19th to the second position in the ranking. The overall impact of 19 of the 27 departments is not significantly different at the 5% level when thus normalized for different citation potentials.',

	{'abstract': u'The line graphs are clustered and assortative. They share these topological features with some social networks. We argue that this similarity reveals the cliquey character of the social networks. In the model proposed here, a social network is the line graph of an initial network of families, communities, interest groups, school classes and small companies. These groups play the role of nodes, and individuals are represented by links between these nodes. The picture is supported by the data on the LiveJournal network of about 8 x 10^6 people. In particular, sharp maxima of the observed data of the degree dependence of the clustering coefficient C(k) are associated with cliques in the social network.',

	{'abstract': u'In this paper, an Entropy functional based online Adaptive Decision Fusion (EADF) framework is developed for image analysis and computer vision applications. In this framework, it is assumed that the compound algorithm consists of several sub-algorithms each of which yielding its own decision as a real number centered around zero, representing the confidence level of that particular sub-algorithm. Decision values are linearly combined with weights which are updated online according to an active fusion method based on performing entropic projections onto convex sets describing sub-algorithms. It is assumed that there is an oracle, who is usually a human operator, providing feedback to the decision fusion method. A video based wildfire detection system is developed to evaluate the performance of the algorithm in handling the problems where data arrives sequentially. In this case, the oracle is the security guard of the forest lookout tower verifying the decision of the combined algorithm. Simulation results are presented. The EADF framework is also tested with a standard dataset.',

	{'abstract': u'Time synchronization for wireless sensor networks (WSNs) has been studied in recent years as a fundamental and significant research issue. Many applications based on these WSNs assume local clocks at each sensor node that need to be synchronized to a common notion of time. Time synchronization in a WSN is critical for accurate time stamping of events and fine-tuned coordination among the sensor nodes to reduce power consumption. This paper proposes a bidirectional, reference based, tree structured time synchronization service for WSNs along with network evaluation phase. This offers a push mechanism for (i) accurate and (ii) low overhead for global time synchronization. Analysis study of proposed approach shows that it is lightweight as the number of required broadcasting messages is constant in one broadcasting domain.',

	{'abstract': u'Let A be a bounded subset of IR^d. We give an upper bound on the volume of the symmetric difference of A and f(A) where f is a translation, a rotation, or the composition of both, a rigid motion. The volume is measured by the d-dimensional Hausdorff measure, which coincides with the Lebesgue measure for Lebesgue measurable sets. We bound the volume of the symmetric difference of A and f(A) in terms of the (d-1)-dimensional volume of the boundary of A and the maximal distance of a boundary point to its image under f. The boundary is measured by the (d-1)-dimensional Hausdorff measure, which matches the surface area for sufficiently nice sets. In the case of translations, our bound is sharp. In the case of rotations, we get a sharp bound under the assumption that the boundary is sufficiently nice. The motivation to study these bounds comes from shape matching. For two shapes A and B in IR^d and a class of transformations, the matching problem asks for a transformation f such that f(A) and B match optimally. The quality of the match is measured by some similarity measure, for instance the volume of overlap. Let A and B be bounded subsets of IR^d, and let F be the function that maps a rigid motion r to the volume of overlap of r(A) and B. Maximizing this function is a shape matching problem, and knowing that F is Lipschitz continuous helps to solve it. We apply our results to bound the difference |F(r) - F(s)| for rigid motions r,s that are close, implying that F is Lipschitz continuous for many metrics on the space of rigid motions. Depending on the metric, also a Lipschitz constant can be deduced from the bound.',

	{'abstract': u"Valiant's (2007) model of evolvability models the evolutionary process of acquiring useful functionality as a restricted form of learning from random examples. Linear threshold functions and their various subclasses, such as conjunctions and decision lists, play a fundamental role in learning theory and hence their evolvability has been the primary focus of research on Valiant's framework (2007). One of the main open problems regarding the model is whether conjunctions are evolvable distribution-independently (Feldman and Valiant, 2008). We show that the answer is negative. Our proof is based on a new combinatorial parameter of a concept class that lower-bounds the complexity of learning from correlations. We contrast the lower bound with a proof that linear threshold functions having a non-negligible margin on the data points are evolvable distribution-independently via a simple mutation algorithm. Our algorithm relies on a non-linear loss function being used to select the hypotheses instead of 0-1 loss in Valiant's (2007) original definition. The proof of evolvability requires that the loss function satisfies several mild conditions that are, for example, satisfied by the quadratic loss function studied in several other works (Michael, 2007; Feldman, 2009; Valiant, 2010). An important property of our evolution algorithm is monotonicity, that is the algorithm guarantees evolvability without any decreases in performance. Previously, monotone evolvability was only shown for conjunctions with quadratic loss (Feldman, 2009) or when the distribution on the domain is severely restricted (Michael, 2007; Feldman, 2009; Kanade et al., 2010)",

	{'abstract': u'In this paper we propose an algebra of synchronous scheduling interfaces which combines the expressiveness of Boolean algebra for logical and functional behaviour with the min-max-plus arithmetic for quantifying the non-functional aspects of synchronous interfaces. The interface theory arises from a realisability interpretation of intuitionistic modal logic (also known as Curry-Howard-Isomorphism or propositions-as-types principle). The resulting algebra of interface types aims to provide a general setting for specifying type-directed and compositional analyses of worst-case scheduling bounds. It covers synchronous control flow under concurrent, multi-processing or multi-threading execution and permits precise statements about exactness and coverage of the analyses supporting a variety of abstractions. The paper illustrates the expressiveness of the algebra by way of some examples taken from network flow problems, shortest-path, task scheduling and worst-case reaction times in synchronous programming.',

	{'abstract': u'Strong resilience properties of dynamical flow networks are analyzed for distributed routing policies. The latter are characterized by the property that the way the inflow at a non-destination node gets split among its outgoing links is allowed to depend only on local information about the current particle densities on the outgoing links. The strong resilience of the network is defined as the infimum sum of link-wise flow capacity reductions under which the network cannot maintain the asymptotic total inflow to the destination node to be equal to the inflow at the origin. A class of distributed routing policies that are locally responsive to local information is shown to yield the maximum possible strong resilience under such local information constraints for an acyclic dynamical flow network with a single origin-destination pair. The maximal strong resilience achievable is shown to be equal to the minimum node residual capacity of the network. The latter depends on the limit flow of the unperturbed network and is defined as the minimum, among all the non-destination nodes, of the sum, over all the links outgoing from the node, of the differences between the maximum flow capacity and the limit flow of the unperturbed network. We propose a simple convex optimization problem to solve for equilibrium limit flows of the unperturbed network that minimize average delay subject to strong resilience guarantees, and discuss the use of tolls to induce such an equilibrium limit flow in transportation networks. Finally, we present illustrative simulations to discuss the connection between cascaded failures and the resilience properties of the network.',

	{'abstract': u'A Semidefinite Programming (SDP) relaxation is an effective computational method to solve a Sensor Network Localization problem, which attempts to determine the locations of a group of sensors given the distances between some of them [11]. In this paper, we analyze and determine new sufficient conditions and formulations that guarantee that the SDP relaxation is exact, i.e., gives the correct solution. These conditions can be useful for designing sensor networks and managing connectivities in practice. Our main contribution is twofold: We present the first non-asymptotic bound on the connectivity or radio range requirement of the sensors in order to ensure the network is uniquely localizable. Determining this range is a key component in the design of sensor networks, and we provide a result that leads to a correct localization of each sensor, for any number of sensors. Second, we introduce a new class of graphs that can always be correctly localized by an SDP relaxation. Specifically, we show that adding a simple objective function to the SDP relaxation model will ensure that the solution is correct when applied to a triangulation graph. Since triangulation graphs are very sparse, this is informationally efficient, requiring an almost minimal amount of distance information. We also analyze a number objective functions for the SDP relaxation to solve the localization problem for a general graph.',

In some examples, agents are able to realize synergy by aggregating information and moving based on local judgments about maximal information gathering expectations. We also explore one- and two-dimensional simplified situations analytically and numerically to provide a framework for analyzing more complex problems. These general considerations provide a guide for designing optimal algorithms for real-world search problems.',

	{'abstract': u'This paper illustrates the application of recent research in region-of-attraction analysis for nonlinear hybrid limit cycles. Three example systems are analyzed in detail: the van der Pol oscillator, the "rimless wheel", and the "compass gait", the latter two being simplified models of underactuated walking robots. The method used involves decomposition of the dynamics about the target cycle into tangential and transverse components, and a search for a Lyapunov function in the transverse dynamics using sum-of-squares analysis (semidefinite programming). Each example illuminates different aspects of the procedure, including optimization of transversal surfaces, the handling of impact maps, optimization of the Lyapunov function, and orbitally-stabilizing control design.',

	{'abstract': u'We propose a factor-graph-based approach to joint channel-estimation-and-decoding (JCED) of bit- interleaved coded orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (BICM-OFDM). In contrast to existing designs, ours is capable of exploiting not only sparsity in sampled channel taps but also clustering among the large taps, behaviors which are known to manifest at larger communication bandwidths. In order to exploit these channel-tap structures, we adopt a two-state Gaussian mixture prior in conjunction with a Markov model on the hidden state. For loopy belief propagation, we exploit a "generalized approximate message passing" (GAMP) algorithm recently developed in the context of compressed sensing, and show that it can be successfully coupled with soft-input soft-output decoding, as well as hidden Markov inference, through the standard sum-product framework. For N subcarriers and any channel length L &lt; N, the resulting JCED-GAMP scheme has a computational complexity of only O(N log2 N + N|S|), where |S| is the constellation size. Numerical experiments using IEEE 802.15.4a channels show that our scheme yields BER performance within 1 dB of the known-channel bound and 3-4 dB better than soft equalization based on LMMSE and LASSO.',

	{'abstract': u'Nowadays, several industrial applications are being ported to parallel architectures. These applications take advantage of the potential parallelism provided by multiple core processors. Many-core processors, especially the GPUs(Graphics Processing Unit), have led the race of floating-point performance since 2003. While the performance improvement of general- purpose microprocessors has slowed significantly, the GPUs have continued to improve relentlessly. As of 2009, the ratio between many-core GPUs and multicore CPUs for peak floating-point calculation throughput is about 10 times. However, as parallel programming requires a non-trivial distribution of tasks and data, developers find it hard to implement their applications effectively. Aiming to improve the use of many-core processors, this work presents an case-study using UML and MARTE profile to specify and generate OpenCL code for intensive signal processing applications. Benchmark results show us the viability of the use of MDE approaches to generate GPU applications.',

	{'abstract': u"This paper studies the opinion dynamics model recently introduced by Hegselmann and Krause: each agent in a group maintains a real number describing its opinion; and each agent updates its opinion by averaging all other opinions that are within some given confidence range. The confidence ranges are distinct for each agent. This heterogeneity and state-dependent topology leads to poorly-understood complex dynamic behavior. We classify the agents via their interconnection topology and, accordingly, compute the equilibria of the system. We conjecture that any trajectory of this model eventually converges to a steady state under fixed topology. To establish this conjecture, we derive two novel sufficient conditions: both conditions guarantee convergence and constant topology for infinite time, while one condition also guarantees monotonicity of the convergence. In the evolution under fixed topology for infinite time, we define leader groups that determine the followers' rate and direction of convergence.",

	{'abstract': u'One of the most influential recent results in network analysis is that many natural networks exhibit a power-law or log-normal degree distribution. This has inspired numerous generative models that match this property. However, more recent work has shown that while these generative models do have the right degree distribution, they are not good models for real life networks due to their differences on other important metrics like conductance. We believe this is, in part, because many of these real-world networks have very different joint degree distributions, i.e. the probability that a randomly selected edge will be between nodes of degree k and l. Assortativity is a sufficient statistic of the joint degree distribution, and it has been previously noted that social networks tend to be assortative, while biological and technological networks tend to be disassortative. We suggest understanding the relationship between network structure and the joint degree distribution of graphs is an interesting avenue of further research. An important tool for such studies are algorithms that can generate random instances of graphs with the same joint degree distribution. This is the main topic of this paper and we study the problem from both a theoretical and practical perspective. We provide an algorithm for constructing simple graphs from a given joint degree distribution, and a Monte Carlo Markov Chain method for sampling them. We also show that the state space of simple graphs with a fixed degree distribution is connected via end point switches. We empirically evaluate the mixing time of this Markov Chain by using experiments based on the autocorrelation of each edge. These experiments show that our Markov Chain mixes quickly on real graphs, allowing for utilization of our techniques in practice.',

	{'abstract': u'In this paper we study von Neumann un-biasing normalisation for ideal and real quantum random number generators, operating on finite strings or infinite bit sequences. In the ideal cases one can obtain the desired un-biasing. This relies critically on the independence of the source, a notion we rigorously define for our model. In real cases, affected by imperfections in measurement and hardware, one cannot achieve a true un-biasing, but, if the bias "drifts sufficiently slowly", the result can be arbitrarily close to un-biasing. For infinite sequences, normalisation can both increase or decrease the (algorithmic) randomness of the generated sequences. A successful application of von Neumann normalisation-in fact, any un-biasing transformation-does exactly what it promises, un-biasing, one (among infinitely many) symptoms of randomness; it will not produce "true" randomness.',

In the case of a bounded and symmetric uncertainty set, we show that the power allocation problem for each SU is simplified, and can be solved in a distributed manner. We derive the conditions for RNE's uniqueness and for convergence of the distributed algorithm; and show that the total throughput (social utility) is less than that at NE when RNE is unique. We also show that for multiple RNEs, the the social utility may be higher at a RNE as compared to that at the corresponding NE, and demonstrate that this is caused by SUs' orthogonal utilization of bandwidth for increasing the social utility.

Here we study the robustness of interdependent networks under targeted attack on high or low degree nodes. We introduce a general technique and show that the problem in interdependent networks can be mapped to the problem in a transformed pair of interdependent networks. We find that when the highly connected nodes are protected and have lower probability to fail, in contrast to single scale free (SF) networks where the percolation threshold , coupled SF networks are significantly more vulnerable with significantly larger than zero. The result implies that interdependent networks are difficult to defend by strategies such as protecting the high degree nodes that have been found useful to significantly improve robustness of single networks.',

	{'abstract': u'We consider a the minimum k-way cut problem for unweighted graphs with a size bound s on the number of cut edges allowed. Thus we seek to remove as few edges as possible so as to split a graph into k components, or report that this requires cutting more than s edges. We show that this problem is fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) in s. More precisely, for s=O(1), our algorithm runs in quadratic time while we have a different linear time algorithm for planar graphs and bounded genus graphs. Our tractability result stands in contrast to known W[1] hardness of related problems. Without the size bound, Downey et al.[2003] proved that the minimum k-way cut problem is W[1] hard in k even for simple unweighted graphs. Downey et al. asked about the status for planar graphs. Our result implies tractability in k for the planar graphs since the minimum k-way cut of a planar graph is of size at most 6k (more generally, we get tractability in k for any graph class with k-way cuts of size limited by is a function of k, e.g., bounded degree graphs, or simple graphs with an excluded minor). A simple reduction shows that vertex cuts are at least as hard as edge cuts, so the minimum k-way vertex cut is also W[1] hard in terms of k. Marx [2004] proved that finding a minimum k-way vertex cut of size s is also W[1] hard in s. Marx asked about the FPT status with edge cuts, which we prove tractable here. We are not aware of any other cut problem where the vertex version is W[1] hard but the edge version is FPT.',

	{'abstract': u'We study the robust Nash equilibrium (RNE) for a class of games in communications systems and networks where the impact of users on each other is an additive function of their strategies. Each user measures this impact, which may be corrupted by uncertainty in feedback delays, estimation errors, movements of users, etc. To study the outcome of the game in which such uncertainties are encountered, we utilize the worst-case robust optimization theory. The existence and uniqueness conditions of RNE are derived using finite-dimensions variational inequalities. To describe the effect of uncertainty on the performance of the system, we use two criteria measured at the RNE and at the equilibrium of the game without uncertainty. The first is the difference between the respective social utility of users and, the second is the differences between the strategies of users at their respective equilibria. These differences are obtained for the case of a unique NE and multiple NEs. To reach the RNE, we propose a distributed algorithm based on the proximal response map and derive the conditions for its convergence. Simulations of the power control game in interference channels, and Jackson networks validate our analysis.',

	{'abstract': u'Building on existing stochastic actor-oriented models for panel data, we employ a conditional logistic framework to explore growth mechanisms for tie creation in continuously-observed networks. This framework models the likelihood of tie formation distinguishing it from hazard models that consider time to tie formation. It enables multiple growth mechanisms for network evolution (homophily, focus constraints, reinforcement, reciprocity, triadic closure, and popularity) to be modeled simultaneously. We apply this framework to communication within a Facebook-like community. The findings exemplify the inadequacy of descriptive measures that test single mechanisms independently. They also indicate how system design shapes behavior and network evolution.',

	{'abstract': u'We consider a retailer selling a single product with limited on-hand inventory over a finite selling season. Customer demand arrives according to a Poisson process, the rate of which is influenced by a single action taken by the retailer (such as price adjustment, sales commission, advertisement intensity, etc.). The relationship between the action and the demand rate is not known in advance. However, the retailer is able to learn the optimal action "on the fly" as she maximizes her total expected revenue based on the observed demand reactions. Using the pricing problem as an example, we propose a dynamic "learning-while-doing" algorithm that only involves function value estimation to achieve a near-optimal performance. Our algorithm employs a series of shrinking price intervals and iteratively tests prices within that interval using a set of carefully chosen parameters. We prove that the convergence rate of our algorithm is among the fastest of all possible algorithms in terms of asymptotic "regret" (the relative loss comparing to the full information optimal solution). Our result closes the performance gaps between parametric and non-parametric learning and between a post-price mechanism and a customer-bidding mechanism. Important managerial insight from this research is that the values of information on both the parametric form of the demand function as well as each customer\'s exact reservation price are less important than prior literature suggests. Our results also suggest that firms would be better off to perform dynamic learning and action concurrently rather than sequentially.',

	{'abstract': u"There are very few results on mixed finite element methods on surfaces. A theory for the study of such methods was given recently by Holst and Stern, using a variational crimes framework in the context of finite element exterior calculus. However, we are not aware of any numerical experiments where mixed finite elements derived from discretizations of exterior calculus are used for a surface domain. This short note shows results of our preliminary experiments using mixed methods for Darcy flow (hence scalar Poisson's equation in mixed form) on surfaces. We demonstrate two numerical methods. One is derived from the primal-dual Discrete Exterior Calculus and the other from lowest order finite element exterior calculus. The programming was done in the language Python, using the PyDEC package which makes the code very short and easy to read. The qualitative convergence studies seem to be promising.",

	{'abstract': u"Algorithmic entropy can be seen as a special case of entropy as studied in statistical mechanics. This viewpoint allows us to apply many techniques developed for use in thermodynamics to the subject of algorithmic information theory. In particular, suppose we fix a universal prefix-free Turing machine and let X be the set of programs that halt for this machine. Then we can regard X as a set of 'microstates', and treat any function on X as an 'observable'. For any collection of observables, we can study the Gibbs ensemble that maximizes entropy subject to constraints on expected values of these observables. We illustrate this by taking the log runtime, length, and output of a program as observables analogous to the energy E, volume V and number of molecules N in a container of gas. The conjugate variables of these observables allow us to define quantities which we call the 'algorithmic temperature' T, 'algorithmic pressure' P and algorithmic potential' mu, since they are analogous to the temperature, pressure and chemical potential. We derive an analogue of the fundamental thermodynamic relation dE = T dS - P d V + mu dN, and use it to study thermodynamic cycles analogous to those for heat engines. We also investigate the values of T, P and mu for which the partition function converges. At some points on the boundary of this domain of convergence, the partition function becomes uncomputable. Indeed, at these points the partition function itself has nontrivial algorithmic entropy.",

	{'abstract': u"Given a convex region in the plane, and a sweep-line as a tool, what is best way to reduce the region to a single point by a sequence of sweeps? The problem of sweeping points by orthogonal sweeps was first studied in [2]. Here we consider the following emph variant of sweeping recently introduced in [1]: In a single sweep, the sweep-line is placed at a start position somewhere in the plane, then moved continuously according to a sweep vector (not necessarily orthogonal to the sweep-line) to another parallel end position, and then lifted from the plane. The cost of a sequence of sweeps is the sum of the lengths of the sweep vectors. The (optimal) sweeping cost of a region is the infimum of the costs over all finite sweeping sequences for that region. An optimal sweeping sequence for a region is one with a minimum total cost, if it exists. Another parameter of interest is the number of sweeps. We show that there exist convex regions for which the optimal sweeping cost cannot be attained by two sweeps. This disproves a conjecture of Bousany, Karker, O'Rourke, and Sparaco stating that two sweeps (with vectors along the two adjacent sides of a minimum-perimeter enclosing parallelogram) always suffice [1]. Moreover, we conjecture that for some convex regions, no finite sweeping sequence is optimal. On the other hand, we show that both the 2-sweep algorithm based on minimum-perimeter enclosing rectangle and the 2-sweep algorithm based on minimum-perimeter enclosing parallelogram achieve a approximation in this sweeping model.",

	{'abstract': u'Social computation, whether in the form of searches performed by swarms of agents or collective predictions of markets, often supplies remarkably good solutions to complex problems. In many examples, individuals trying to solve a problem locally can aggregate their information and work together to arrive at a superior global solution. This suggests that there may be general principles of information aggregation and coordination that can transcend particular applications. Here we show that the general structure of this problem can be cast in terms of information theory and derive mathematical conditions that lead to optimal multi-agent searches. Specifically, we illustrate the problem in terms of local search algorithms for autonomous agents looking for the spatial location of a stochastic source. We explore the types of search problems, defined in terms of the statistical properties of the source and the nature of measurements at each agent, for which coordination among multiple searchers yields an advantage beyond that gained by having the same number of independent searchers. We show that effective coordination corresponds to synergy and that ineffective coordination corresponds to independence as defined using information theory. We classify explicit types of sources in terms of their potential for synergy. We show that sources that emit uncorrelated signals provide no opportunity for synergetic coordination while sources that emit signals that are correlated in some way, do allow for strong synergy between searchers. These general considerations are crucial for designing optimal algorithms for particular search problems in real world settings.',

	{'abstract': u'In cyber-physical systems where sensors measure the temporal evolution of a given phenomenon of interest and radio communication takes place over short distances, the energy spent for source acquisition and compression may be comparable with that used for transmission. Additionally, in order to avoid limited lifetime issues, sensors may be powered via energy harvesting and thus collect all the energy they need from the environment. This work addresses the problem of energy allocation over source acquisition/compression and transmission for energy-harvesting sensors. At first, focusing on a single-sensor, energy management policies are identified that guarantee a maximal average distortion while at the same time ensuring the stability of the queue connecting source and channel encoders. It is shown that the identified class of policies is optimal in the sense that it stabilizes the queue whenever this is feasible by any other technique that satisfies the same average distortion constraint. Moreover, this class of policies performs an independent resource optimization for the source and channel encoders. Analog transmission techniques as well as suboptimal strategies that do not use the energy buffer (battery) or use it only for adapting either source or channel encoder energy allocation are also studied for performance comparison. The problem of optimizing the desired trade-off between average distortion and delay is then formulated and solved via dynamic programming tools. Finally, a system with multiple sensors is considered and time-division scheduling strategies are derived that are able to maintain the stability of all data queues and to meet the average distortion constraints at all sensors whenever it is feasible.',

Our experimental results show that our method is comparable in runtime to the fastest heuristics, while still offering consistency guarantees.',

	{'abstract': u'Stochastic orders are binary relations defined on probability distributions which capture intuitive notions like being larger or being more variable. This paper introduces stochastic ordering of instantaneous SNRs of fading channels as a tool to compare the performance of communication systems over different channels. Stochastic orders unify existing performance metrics such as ergodic capacity, and metrics based on error rate functions for commonly used modulation schemes through their relation with convex, and completely monotonic (c.m.) functions. Toward this goal, performance metrics such as instantaneous error rates of M-QAM and M-PSK modulations are shown to be c.m. functions of the instantaneous SNR, while metrics such as the instantaneous capacity are seen to have a completely monotonic derivative (c.m.d.). It is shown that the commonly used parametric fading distributions for modeling line of sight (LoS), exhibit a monotonicity in the LoS parameter with respect to the stochastic Laplace transform order. Using stochastic orders, average performance of systems involving multiple random variables are compared over different channels, even when closed form expressions for such averages are not tractable. These include diversity combining schemes, relay networks, and signal detection over fading channels with non-Gaussian additive noise, which are investigated herein. Simulations are also provided to corroborate our results.',

	{'abstract': u'We consider the problem of broadcast with common messages, and focus on the case that the common message rate , i.e., the rate of the message intended for all the receivers in the set , is the same for all the set of the same cardinality. Instead of attempting to characterize the capacity region of general broadcast channels, we only consider the structure of the capacity region that any broadcast channel should bear. The concept of latent capacity region is useful in capturing these underlying constraints, and we provide a complete characterization of the latent capacity region for the symmetric broadcast problem. The converse proof of this tight characterization relies on a deterministic broadcast channel model. The achievability proof generalizes the familiar rate transfer argument to include more involved erasure correction coding among messages, thus revealing an inherent connection between broadcast with common message and erasure correction codes.',

Formally, we consider mobile agents performing independent random walks on an -node grid. At time , each agent is located at a random node of the grid and one agent has a rumor. The spread of the rumor is governed by a dynamic communication graph process , where two agents are connected by an edge in iff their distance at time is within their transmission radius . Modeling the physical reality that the speed of radio transmission is much faster than the motion of the agents, we assume that the rumor can travel throughout a connected component of before the graph is altered by the motion. We study the broadcast time of the system, which is the time it takes for all agents to know the rumor. We focus on the sparse case (below the percolation point ) where, with high probability, no connected component in has more than a logarithmic number of agents and the broadcast time is dominated by the time it takes for many independent random walks to meet each other. Quite surprisingly, we show that for a system below the percolation point the broadcast time does not depend on the relation between the mobility speed and the transmission radius. In fact, we prove that for any , even when the transmission range is significantly larger than the mobility range in one step, giving a tight characterization up to logarithmic factors. Our result complements a recent result of Peres et al. (SODA 2011) who showed that above the percolation point the broadcast time is polylogarithmic in .',

	{'abstract': u'Some existing notions of redundancy among association rules allow for a logical-style characterization and lead to irredundant bases of absolutely minimum size. One can push the intuition of redundancy further and find an intuitive notion of interest of an association rule, in terms of its "novelty" with respect to other rules. Namely: an irredundant rule is so because its confidence is higher than what the rest of the rules would suggest; then, one can ask: how much higher? We propose to measure such a sort of "novelty" through the confidence boost of a rule, which encompasses two previous similar notions (confidence width and rule blocking, of which the latter is closely related to the earlier measure "improvement"). Acting as a complement to confidence and support, the confidence boost helps to obtain small and crisp sets of mined association rules, and solves the well-known problem that, in certain cases, rules of negative correlation may pass the confidence bound. We analyze the properties of two versions of the notion of confidence boost, one of them a natural generalization of the other. We develop efficient algorithmics to filter rules according to their confidence boost, compare the concept to some similar notions in the bibliography, and describe the results of some experimentation employing the new notions on standard benchmark datasets. We describe an open-source association mining tool that embodies one of our variants of confidence boost in such a way that the data mining process does not require the user to select any value for any parameter.',

	{'abstract': u'In this paper, we consider a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channel subjected to block fading. Reliability (in terms of achieved diversity order) and rate (in number of symbols transmitted per channel use) are of interest in such channels. We propose a new precoding scheme which achieves both full diversity (th order diversity) as well as full rate ( symbols per channel use) using partial channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT), applicable in MIMO systems including asymmetric MIMO. The proposed scheme achieves full diversity and improved coding gain through an optimization over the choice of constellation sets. The optimization maximizes for our precoding scheme subject to an energy constraint. The scheme requires feedback of angle parameter values, compared to real coefficients in case of full CSIT. Error rate performance results for , , , precoded MIMO systems (with symbols per channel use, respectively) show that the proposed precoding achieves 3rd, 6th, 4th and 8th order diversities, respectively. These performances are shown to be better than other precoding schemes in the literature; the better performance is due to the choice of the signal sets and the feedback angles in the proposed scheme.',

	{'abstract': u'Target coverage problem in wireless sensor networks is concerned with maximizing the lifetime of the network while continuously monitoring a set of targets. A sensor covers targets which are within the sensing range. For a set of sensors and a set of targets, the sensor-target coverage relationship is assumed to be known. A sensor cover is a set of sensors that covers all the targets. The target coverage problem is to determine a set of sensor covers with maximum aggregated lifetime while constraining the life of each sensor by its initial battery life. The problem is proved to be NP-complete and heuristic algorithms to solve this problem are proposed. In the present study, we give a unified interpretation of earlier algorithms and propose a new and efficient algorithm. We show that all known algorithms are based on a common reasoning though they seem to be derived from different algorithmic paradigms. We also show that though some algorithms guarantee bound on the quality of the solution, this bound is not meaningful and not practical too. Our interpretation provides a better insight to the solution techniques. We propose a new greedy heuristic which prioritizes sensors on residual battery life. We show empirically that the proposed algorithm outperforms all other heuristics in terms of quality of solution. Our experimental study over a large set of randomly generated problem instances also reveals that a very na "ive greedy approach yields solutions which is reasonably (appx. 10%) close to the actual optimal solutions.',

Since population density is non-uniform in real social networks, a scale invariant friendship network(SIFN) based on the above empirical law is introduced to capture this phenomenon. We prove the time complexity of navigation in 2-dimensional SIFN is at most . In the real searching experiment, individuals often resort to extra information besides geography location. Thus, real-world searching process may be seen as a projection of navigation in a -dimensional SIFN(). Therefore, we also discuss the relationship between high and low dimensional SIFN.

	{'abstract': u'More information is now being published in machine processable form on the web and, as de-facto distributed knowledge bases are materializing, partly encouraged by the vision of the Semantic Web, the focus is shifting from the publication of this information to its consumption. Platforms for data integration, visualization and analysis that are based on a graph representation of information appear first candidates to be consumers of web-based information that is readily expressible as graphs. The question is whether the adoption of these platforms to information available on the Semantic Web requires some adaptation of their data structures and semantics. Ondex is a network-based data integration, analysis and visualization platform which has been developed in a Life Sciences context. A number of features, including semantic annotation via ontologies and an attention to provenance and evidence, make this an ideal candidate to consume Semantic Web information, as well as a prototype for the application of network analysis tools in this context. By analyzing the Ondex data structure and its usage, we have found a set of discrepancies and errors arising from the semantic mismatch between a procedural approach to network analysis and the implications of a web-based representation of information. We report in the paper on the simple methodology that we have adopted to conduct such analysis, and on issues that we have found which may be relevant for a range of similar platforms',

	{'abstract': u'Rich-club, assortativity and clustering coefficients are frequently-used measures to estimate topological properties of complex networks. Here we find that the connectivity among a very small portion of the richest nodes can dominate the assortativity and clustering coefficients of a large network, which reveals that the rich-club connectivity is leveraged throughout the network. Our study suggests that more attention should be payed to the organization pattern of rich nodes, for the structure of a complex system as a whole is determined by the associations between the most influential individuals. Moreover, by manipulating the connectivity pattern in a very small rich-club, it is sufficient to produce a network with desired assortativity or transitivity. Conversely, our findings offer a simple explanation for the observed assortativity and transitivity in many real world networks --- such biases can be explained by the connectivities among the richest nodes.',

	{'abstract': u'(To appear in Theory and Practice of Logic Programming (TPLP).) The seaport of Gioia Tauro is the largest transshipment terminal of the Mediterranean coast. A crucial management task for the companies operating in the seaport is team building: the problem of properly allocating the available personnel for serving the incoming ships. Teams have to be carefully arranged in order to meet several constraints, such as allocation of the employees with the appropriate skills, fair distribution of the working load, and turnover of the heavy/dangerous roles. This makes team building a hard and expensive task requiring several hours per day of manual preparation. In this paper we present a system based on Answer Set Programming (ASP) for the automatic generation of the teams of employees in the seaport of Gioia Tauro. The system is currently exploited in the Gioia Tauro seaport by ICO BLG, a company specialized in automobile logistics.',

	{'abstract': u'We study the threshold of epidemic models in quenched networks with degree distribution given by a power-law. For the susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) model the activity threshold lambda_c vanishes in the large size limit on any network whose maximum degree k_max diverges with the system size, at odds with heterogeneous mean-field (HMF) theory. The vanishing of the threshold has not to do with the scale-free nature of the connectivity pattern and is instead originated by the largest hub in the system being active for any spreading rate lambda&gt;1/sqrt and playing the role of a self-sustained source that spreads the infection to the rest of the system. The susceptible-infected-removed (SIR) model displays instead agreement with HMF theory and a finite threshold for scale-rich networks. We conjecture that on quenched scale-rich networks the threshold of generic epidemic models is vanishing or finite depending on the presence or absence of a steady state.',

	{'abstract': u'In multi-class communication networks, traffic surges due to one class of users can significantly degrade the performance for other classes. During these transient periods, it is thus of crucial importance to implement priority mechanisms that conserve the quality of service experienced by the affected classes, while ensuring that the temporarily unstable class is not entirely neglected. In this paper, we examine the complex interaction occurring between several classes of traffic when classes obtain bandwidth proportionally to their incoming traffic. We characterize the evolution of the network from the moment the initial surge takes place until the system reaches its equilibrium. Using an appropriate scaling, we show that the trajectories of the temporarily unstable class can be described by a differential equation, while those of the stable classes retain their stochastic nature. A stochastic averaging phenomenon occurs and the dynamics of the temporarily unstable and the stable classes continue to influence one another. We further proceed to characterize the obtained differential equations and the stability region under this scaling for monotone networks. We illustrate these result on several toy examples and we finally build a penalization rule using these results for a network integrating streaming and elastic traffic.',

In particular, we present improvements to the independent Metropolis--Hastings algorithm that significantly decrease the variance of any estimator derived from the MCMC output, for a null computing cost since those improvements are based on a fixed number of target density evaluations. Furthermore, the techniques developed in this paper do not jeopardize the Markovian convergence properties of the algorithm, since they are based on the Rao--Blackwell principles of Gelfand and Smith (1990), already exploited in Casella and Robert (1996), Atchade and Perron (2005) and Douc and Robert (2010). We illustrate those improvements both on a toy normal example and on a classical probit regression model, but stress the fact that they are applicable in any case where the independent Metropolis-Hastings is applicable.',

	{'abstract': u'We develop a technique that we call Conflict Packing in the context of kernelization, obtaining (and improving) several polynomial kernels for editing problems on dense instances. We apply this technique on several well-studied problems: Feedback Arc Set in (Bipartite) Tournaments, Dense Rooted Triplet Inconsistency and Betweenness in Tournaments. For the former, one is given a (bipartite) tournament and seeks a set of at most arcs whose reversal in results in an acyclic (bipartite) tournament. While a linear vertex-kernel is already known for the first problem, using the Conflict Packing allows us to find a so-called safe partition, the central tool of the kernelization algorithm in, with simpler arguments. For the case of bipartite tournaments, the same technique allows us to obtain a quadratic vertex-kernel. Again, such a kernel was already known to exist, using the concept of so-called bimodules. We believe however that providing an unifying technique to cope with such problems is interesting. Regarding Dense Rooted Triplet Inconsistency, one is given a set of vertices and a dense collection of rooted binary trees over three vertices of and seeks a rooted tree over containing all but at most triplets from . As a main consequence of our technique, we prove that the Dense Rooted Triplet Inconsistency problem admits a linear vertex-kernel. This result improves the best known bound of vertices for this problem. Finally, we use this technique to obtain a linear vertex-kernel for Betweenness in Tournaments, where one is given a set of vertices and a dense collection of so-called betweenness triplets and seeks a linear ordering of the vertices containing all but at most triplets from .',

	{'abstract': u'Networks commonly exhibit a community structure, whereby groups of vertices are more densely connected to each other than to other vertices. Often these communities overlap, such that each vertex may occur in more than one community. However, two distinct types of overlapping are possible: crisp (where each vertex belongs fully to each community of which it is a member) and fuzzy (where each vertex belongs to each community to a different extent). We investigate the effects of the fuzziness of community overlap. We find that it has a strong effect on the performance of community detection methods: some algorithms perform better with fuzzy overlapping while others favour crisp overlapping. We also evaluate the performance of some algorithms that recover the belonging coefficients when the overlap is fuzzy. Finally, we investigate whether real networks contain fuzzy or crisp overlapping.',

In this paper, a simple design of a linear dispersive space-time-frequency (STF) code is proposed with a design criterion to achieve high rate for frequency-selective channels in terms of multipath when the PIC group decoding is applied at receiver. With an appropriate grouping scheme as well as the PIC group decoding, the proposed STF code is shown to obtain the similar diversity gain as the maximum likelihood (ML) decoding, namely full-dimensional sphere decoding, but have a low decoding complexity. It seems as an intermediate decoding between the ML receiver and zero-forcing (ZF) receiver. The proposed grouping design criterion for the PIC group decoding to achieve full diversity deploying the orthogonal-frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) technique is also an intermediate condition between the loosest ML full rank criterion of codewords and the strongest ZF linear independence condition of the column vectors for the equivalent frequency-selective channel matrix. It can achieves full diversity with the PIC group decoding for any number of sub-carriers and the data rate can be made high. Several code design examples are illustrated for the feasibility of this coding scheme. Simulation results show that the proposed STF code can well address the rate-performance-complexity tradeoff of the multiple-input multiple-output orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM) communication system.',

	{'abstract': u'This document contains the documentation of TOBI (Tools for BCI) Interface A (TiA). TiA is a standardized interface to transmit raw biosignals. It is able to deal with multirate and block-oriented data transmission. Data is distinguished by different signal types (e.g., EEG, EOG, NIRS,...), whereby those signals can be acquired at the same time from different acquisition devices. TiA is built as a client-server model. Multiple clients can connect to one server. Information is exchanged via a control- and a separated data connection. Control commands and meta information are transmitted over the control connection. Raw biosignal data is delivered using the data connection in a unidirectional way. For this purpose a standardized handshaking protocol and raw data packet have been developed. Thus, an abstraction layer between hardware devices and data processing was evolved facilitating standardization.',

	{'abstract': u'We study the critical effect of quarantine on the propagation of epidemics on an adaptive network of social contacts. For this purpose, we analyze the susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model in the presence of quarantine, where susceptible individuals protect themselves by disconnecting their links to infected neighbors with probability w, and reconnecting them to other susceptible individuals chosen at random. Starting from a single infected individual, we show by an analytical approach and simulations that there is a phase transition at a critical rewiring (quarantine) threshold w_c separating a phase (w&lt;w_c) where the disease reaches a large fraction of the population, from a phase (w &gt;= w_c) where the disease does not spread out. We find that in our model the topology of the network strongly affects the size of the propagation, and that w_c increases with the mean degree and heterogeneity of the network. We also find that w_c is reduced if we perform a preferential rewiring, in which the rewiring probability is proportional to the degree of infected nodes.',

	{'abstract': u'Techniques in which words are represented as vectors have proved useful in many applications in computational linguistics, however there is currently no general semantic formalism for representing meaning in terms of vectors. We present a framework for natural language semantics in which words, phrases and sentences are all represented as vectors, based on a theoretical analysis which assumes that meaning is determined by context. In the theoretical analysis, we define a corpus model as a mathematical abstraction of a text corpus. The meaning of a string of words is assumed to be a vector representing the contexts in which it occurs in the corpus model. Based on this assumption, we can show that the vector representations of words can be considered as elements of an algebra over a field. We note that in applications of vector spaces to representing meanings of words there is an underlying lattice structure; we interpret the partial ordering of the lattice as describing entailment between meanings. We also define the context-theoretic probability of a string, and, based on this and the lattice structure, a degree of entailment between strings. We relate the framework to existing methods of composing vector-based representations of meaning, and show that our approach generalises many of these, including vector addition, component-wise multiplication, and the tensor product.',

	{'abstract': u'Distributed Video Coding (DVC) is a new coding paradigm for video compression, based on Slepian- Wolf (lossless coding) and Wyner-Ziv (lossy coding) information theoretic results. DVC is useful for emerging applications such as wireless video cameras, wireless low-power surveillance networks and disposable video cameras for medical applications etc. The primary objective of DVC is low-complexity video encoding, where bulk of computation is shifted to the decoder, as opposed to low-complexity decoder in conventional video compression standards such as H.264 and MPEG etc. There are couple of early architectures and implementations of DVC from Stanford University[2][3] in 2002, Berkeley University PRISM (Power-efficient, Robust, hIgh-compression, Syndrome-based Multimedia coding)[4][5] in 2002 and European project DISCOVER (DIStributed COding for Video SERvices)[6] in 2007. Primarily there are two types of DVC techniques namely pixel domain and transform domain based. Transform domain design will have better rate-distortion (RD) performance as it exploits spatial correlation between neighbouring samples and compacts the block energy into as few transform coefficients as possible (aka energy compaction). In this paper, architecture, implementation details and "C" model results of our transform domain DVC are presented.',

	{'abstract': u'I present several new relations between mutual information (MI) and statistical estimation error for a system that can be regarded simultaneously as a communication channel and as an estimator of an input parameter. I first derive a second-order result between MI and Fisher information (FI) that is valid for sufficiently narrow priors, but arbitrary channels. A second relation furnishes a lower bound on the MI in terms of the minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) on the Bayesian estimation of the input parameter from the channel output, one that is valid for arbitrary channels and priors. The existence of such a lower bound, while extending previous work relating the MI to the FI that is valid only in the asymptotic and high-SNR limits, elucidates further the fundamental connection between information and estimation theoretic measures of fidelity. The remaining relations I present are inequalities and correspondences among MI, FI, and MMSE in the presence of nuisance parameters.',

	{'abstract': u'Heterogeneous networks are a flexible deployment model that rely on low power nodes to improve the user broadband experience in a cost effective manner. Femtocells are an integral part of heterogeneous networks, whose main purpose is to improve the indoor capacity. When restricting access to home users, femtocells cause a substantial interference problem that cannot be mitigated through coordination with the macrocell base station. In this paper, we analyze multiple antenna communication on the downlink of a macrocell network, with femtocell overlay. We evaluate the feasibility of limited feedback beamforming given delay on the feedback channel, quantization error and uncoordinated interference from the femtocells. We model the femtocell spatial distribution as a Poisson point process and the temporal correlation of the channel according to a Gauss-Markov model. We derive the probability of outage at the macrocell users as a function of the temporal correlation, the femtocell density, and the feedback rate. We propose rate backoff to maximize the average achievable rate in the network. Simulation results show that limited feedback beamforming is a viable solution for femtocell networks despite the CSI inaccuracy and the interference. They illustrate how properly designed rate backoff improves the achievable rate of the macrocell system.',

	{'abstract': u"We present a new certified and complete algorithm to compute arrangements of real planar algebraic curves. Our algorithm provides a geometric-topological analysis of the decomposition of the plane induced by a finite number of algebraic curves in terms of a cylindrical algebraic decomposition of the plane. Compared to previous approaches, we improve in two main aspects: Firstly, we significantly reduce the amount of exact operations, that is, our algorithms only uses resultant and gcd as purely symbolic operations. Secondly, we introduce a new hybrid method in the lifting step of our algorithm which combines the usage of a certified numerical complex root solver and information derived from the resultant computation. Additionally, we never consider any coordinate transformation and the output is also given with respect to the initial coordinate system. We implemented our algorithm as a prototypical package of the C++-library CGAL. Our implementation exploits graphics hardware to expedite the resultant and gcd computation. We also compared our implementation with the current reference implementation, that is, CGAL's curve analysis and arrangement for algebraic curves. For various series of challenging instances, our experiments show that the new implementation outperforms the existing one.",

	{'abstract': u'Transactional network data can be thought of as a list of one-to-many communications(e.g., email) between nodes in a social network. Most social network models convert this type of data into binary relations between pairs of nodes. We develop a latent mixed membership model capable of modeling richer forms of transactional network data, including relations between more than two nodes. The model can cluster nodes and predict transactions. The block-model nature of the model implies that groups can be characterized in very general ways. This flexible notion of group structure enables discovery of rich structure in transactional networks. Estimation and inference are accomplished via a variational EM algorithm. Simulations indicate that the learning algorithm can recover the correct generative model. Interesting structure is discovered in the Enron email dataset and another dataset extracted from the Reddit website. Analysis of the Reddit data is facilitated by a novel performance measure for comparing two soft clusterings. The new model is superior at discovering mixed membership in groups and in predicting transactions.',

	{'abstract': u'An unexpected breakdown in the existing theory of quantum serial turbo coding is that a quantum convolutional encoder cannot simultaneously be recursive and non-catastrophic. These properties are essential for quantum turbo code families to have a minimum distance growing with blocklength and for their iterative decoding algorithm to converge, respectively. Here, we show that the entanglement-assisted paradigm simplifies the theory of quantum turbo codes, in the sense that an entanglement-assisted quantum (EAQ) convolutional encoder can possess both of the aforementioned desirable properties. We give several examples of EAQ convolutional encoders that are both recursive and non-catastrophic and detail their relevant parameters. We then modify the quantum turbo decoding algorithm of Poulin et al., in order to have the constituent decoders pass along only "extrinsic information" to each other rather than a posteriori probabilities as in the decoder of Poulin et al., and this leads to a significant improvement in the performance of unassisted quantum turbo codes. Other simulation results indicate that entanglement-assisted turbo codes can operate reliably in a noise regime 4.73 dB beyond that of standard quantum turbo codes, when used on a memoryless depolarizing channel. Furthermore, several of our quantum turbo codes are within 1 dB or less of their hashing limits, so that the performance of quantum turbo codes is now on par with that of classical turbo codes. Finally, we prove that entanglement is the resource that enables a convolutional encoder to be both non-catastrophic and recursive because an encoder acting on only information qubits, classical bits, gauge qubits, and ancilla qubits cannot simultaneously satisfy them.',

As the analysis is performed on large data sets, we used Grid Computing to implement a service for using on Computational Grids with a Web-based client interface, which will be greatly useful and convenient for those who are studying the ground thermal environment and heat island effects by using Landsat TM/ETM+ bands, and have typical workstations, with no special computing and storing resources for computationally intensive satellite image processing and no license for a commercial image processing tool. Based on the satellite imagery, the paper also addresses a Supervised Classification algorithm and the computation of two indices of great value in water resources management, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), respectively Land Surface Emissivity (LSE).',

	{'abstract': u'One of the most important questions in studying quantum computation is: whether a quantum computer can solve NP-complete problems more efficiently than a classical computer? In 2000, Farhi, et al. (Science, 292(5516):472--476, 2001) proposed the adiabatic quantum optimization (AQO), a paradigm that directly attacks NP-hard optimization problems. How powerful is AQO? Early on, van Dam and Vazirani claimed that AQO failed (i.e. would take exponential time) for a family of 3SAT instances they constructed. More recently, Altshuler, et al. (Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 107(28): 12446--12450, 2010) claimed that AQO failed also for random instances of the NP-complete Exact Cover problem. In this paper, we make clear that all these negative results are only for a specific AQO algorithm. We do so by demonstrating different AQO algorithms for the same problem for which their arguments no longer hold. Whether AQO fails or succeeds for solving the NP-complete problems (either the worst case or the average case) requires further investigation. Our AQO algorithms for Exact Cover and 3SAT are based on the polynomial reductions to the NP-complete Maximum-weight Independent Set (MIS) problem.',

	{'abstract': u'Threshold feedback policies are well known and provably rate-wise optimal selective feedback techniques for communication systems requiring partial channel state information (CSI). However, optimal selection of thresholds at mobile users to maximize information theoretic data rates subject to feedback constraints is an open problem. In this paper, we focus on the optimal threshold selection problem, and provide a solution for this problem for finite feedback systems. Rather surprisingly, we show that using the same threshold values at all mobile users is not always a rate-wise optimal feedback strategy, even for a system with identical users experiencing statistically the same channel conditions. By utilizing the theory of majorization, we identify an underlying Schur-concave structure in the rate function and obtain sufficient conditions for a homogenous threshold feedback policy to be optimal. Our results hold for most fading channel models, and we illustrate an application of our results to familiar Rayleigh fading channels.',

We emphasize two statistical approaches for studying dependence, including Pearson's correlation coefficient and the extremal dependence analysis method. We apply these methods to large data sets of packet traces from three networks. Our major results show that Pearson's correlation coefficients between size and duration are much smaller than one might expect. We also find that correlation coefficients between size and rate are generally small and can be strongly affected by applying thresholds to size or duration. Based on Transmission Control Protocol connection startup mechanisms, we argue that thresholds on size should be more useful than thresholds on duration in the analysis of correlations. Using extremal dependence analysis, we draw a similar conclusion, finding remarkable independence for extremal values of size and rate.",

In this paper we find two separate O (n2) algorithms so that a minimally 2-connected graph can be obtained from a 2-tree and a minimally k-connected graph can be obtained from a k-tree.

	{'abstract': u'Beamforming techniques utilizing only partial channel state information (CSI) has gained popularity over other communication strategies requiring perfect CSI thanks to their lower feedback requirements. The amount of feedback in beamforming based communication systems can be further reduced through selective feedback techniques in which only the users with channels good enough are allowed to feed back by means of a decentralized feedback policy. In this paper, we prove that thresholding at the receiver is the rate-wise optimal decentralized feedback policy for feedback limited systems with prescribed feedback constraints. This result is highly adaptable due to its distribution independent nature, provides an analytical justification for the use of threshold feedback policies in practical systems, and reinforces previous work analyzing threshold feedback policies as a selective feedback technique without proving its optimality. It is robust to selfish unilateral deviations. Finally, it reduces the search for rate-wise optimal feedback policies subject to feedback constraints from function spaces to a finite dimensional Euclidean space.',

	{'abstract': u'We study the setting in which the bits of an unknown infinite binary sequence x are revealed sequentially to an observer. We show that very limited assumptions about x allow one to make successful predictions about unseen bits of x. First, we study the problem of successfully predicting a single 0 from among the bits of x. In our model we have only one chance to make a prediction, but may do so at a time of our choosing. We describe and motivate this as the problem of a frog who wants to cross a road safely. Letting N_t denote the number of 1s among the first t bits of x, we say that x is "eps-weakly sparse" if lim inf (N_t/t) &lt;= eps. Our main result is a randomized algorithm that, given any eps-weakly sparse sequence x, predicts a 0 of x with success probability as close as desired to 1 - eps. Thus we can perform this task with essentially the same success probability as under the much stronger assumption that each bit of x takes the value 1 independently with probability eps. We apply this result to show how to successfully predict a bit (0 or 1) under a broad class of possible assumptions on the sequence x. The assumptions are stated in terms of the behavior of a finite automaton M reading the bits of x. We also propose and solve a variant of the well-studied "ignorant forecasting" problem. For every eps &gt; 0, we give a randomized forecasting algorithm S_eps that, given sequential access to a binary sequence x, makes a prediction of the form: "A p fraction of the next N bits will be 1s." (The algorithm gets to choose p, N, and the time of the prediction.) For any fixed sequence x, the forecast fraction p is accurate to within +-eps with probability 1 - eps.',

	{'abstract': u'Key establishment in sensor networks becomes a challenging problem because of the resource limitations of the sensors and also due to vulnerability to physical capture of the sensor nodes. In this paper, we propose an unconditionally secure probabilistic group-based key pre-distribution scheme for a heterogeneous wireless sensor network. The proposed scheme always guarantees that no matter how many sensor nodes are compromised, the non-compromised nodes can still communicate with 100% secrecy, i.e., the proposed scheme is always unconditionally secure against node capture attacks. Moreover, it provides significantly better trade-off between communication overhead, computational overhead, network connectivity and security against node capture as compared to the existing key pre-distribution schemes. It also supports dynamic node addition after the initial deployment of the nodes in the network.',

	{'abstract': u'We investigate a model of stratified economic interactions between agents when the notion of spatial location is introduced. The agents are placed on a network with near-neighbor connections. Interactions between neighbors can occur only if the difference in their wealth is less than a threshold value that defines the width of the economic classes. By employing concepts from spatiotemporal dynamical systems, three types of patterns can be identified in the system as parameters are varied: laminar, intermittent and turbulent states. The transition from the laminar state to the turbulent state is characterized by the activity of the system, a quantity that measures the average exchange of wealth over long times. The degree of inequality in the wealth distribution for different parameter values is characterized by the Gini Coefficient. High levels of activity are associated to low values of the Gini coefficient. It is found that the topological properties of the network have little effect on the activity of the system, but the Gini coefficient increases when the clustering coefficient of the network is increased.',

	{'abstract': u'Spectrum scarceness is one of the major challenges that the present world is facing. The efficient use of existing licensed spectrum is becoming most critical as growing demand of the radio spectrum. Different researches show that the use of licensed are not utilized inefficiently. It has been also shown that primary user does not use more than 70% of the licensed frequency band most of the time. Many researchers are trying to found the techniques that efficiently utilize the under-utilized licensed spectrum. One of the approaches is the use of "Cognitive Radio". This allows the radio to learn from its environment, changing certain parameters. Based on this knowledge the radio can dynamically exploit the spectrum holes in the licensed band of the spectrum.

	{'abstract': u'Pairwise key establishment is one of the fundamental security services in sensor networks which enables sensor nodes in a sensor network to communicate securely with each other using cryptographic techniques. It is not feasible to apply traditional public key management techniques in resource-constrained sensor nodes, and also because the sensor nodes are vulnerable to physical capture. In this paper, we introduce a new scheme called the identity based key pre-distribution using a pseudo random function (IBPRF), which has better trade-off between communication overhead, network connectivity and resilience against node capture compared to the other key pre-distribution schemes. Our scheme can be easily adapted in mobile sensor networks. This scheme supports the addition of new sensor nodes after the initial deployment and also works for any deployment topology. In addition, we propose an improved version of our scheme to support large sensor networks.',

	{'abstract': u'We consider coevolution of site status and link structures from two different initial networks: a one dimensional Ising chain and a scale free network. The dynamics is governed by a preassigned stability parameter , and a rewiring factor , that determines whether the Ising spin at the chosen site flips or whether the node gets rewired to another node in the system. This dynamics has also been studied with Ising spins distributed randomly among nodes which lie on a network with preferential attachment. We have observed the steady state average stability and magnetisation for both kinds of systems to have an idea about the effect of initial network topology. Although the average stability shows almost similar behaviour, the magnetisation depends on the initial condition we start from. Apart from the local dynamics, the global effect on the dynamics has also been studied. These parameters show interesting variations for different values of and , which helps in determining the steady-state condition for a given substrate.',

	{'abstract': u'We study the Gaussian MIMO wiretap channel with a transmitter, a legitimate receiver, an eavesdropper and an external helper, each equipped with multiple antennas. The transmitter sends confidential messages to its intended receiver, while the helper transmits jamming signals independent of the source message to confuse the eavesdropper. The jamming signal is assumed to be treated as noise at both the intended receiver and the eavesdropper. We obtain a closed-form expression for the structure of the artificial noise covariance matrix that guarantees no decrease in the secrecy capacity of the wiretap channel. We also describe how to find specific realizations of this covariance matrix expression that provide good secrecy rate performance, even when there is no non-trivial null space between the helper and the intended receiver. Unlike prior work, our approach considers the general MIMO case, and is not restricted to SISO or MISO scenarios.',

	{'abstract': u'We study decision making in environments where the reward is only partially observed, but can be modeled as a function of an action and an observed context. This setting, known as contextual bandits, encompasses a wide variety of applications including health-care policy and Internet advertising. A central task is evaluation of a new policy given historic data consisting of contexts, actions and received rewards. The key challenge is that the past data typically does not faithfully represent proportions of actions taken by a new policy. Previous approaches rely either on models of rewards or models of the past policy. The former are plagued by a large bias whereas the latter have a large variance. In this work, we leverage the strength and overcome the weaknesses of the two approaches by applying the doubly robust technique to the problems of policy evaluation and optimization. We prove that this approach yields accurate value estimates when we have either a good (but not necessarily consistent) model of rewards or a good (but not necessarily consistent) model of past policy. Extensive empirical comparison demonstrates that the doubly robust approach uniformly improves over existing techniques, achieving both lower variance in value estimation and better policies. As such, we expect the doubly robust approach to become common practice.',

	{'abstract': u'How are people linked in a highly connected society? Since in many networks a power-law (scale-free) node-degree distribution can be observed, power-law might be seen as a universal characteristics of networks. But this study of communication in the Flickr social online network reveals that power-law node-degree distributions are restricted to only sparsely connected networks. More densely connected networks, by contrast, show an increasing divergence from power-law. This work shows that this observation is consistent with the classic idea from social sciences that similarity is the driving factor behind communication in social networks. The strong relation between communication strength and node similarity could be confirmed by analyzing the Flickr network. It also is shown that node similarity as a network formation model can reproduce the characteristics of different network densities and hence can be used as a model for describing the topological transition from weakly to strongly connected societies.',

	{'abstract': u'In this paper we study the optimal formation control of multiple agents whose interaction parameters are adjusted upon a cost function consisting of both the control energy and the geometrical performance. By optimizing the interaction parameters and by the linear quadratic regulation(LQR) controllers, the upper bound of the cost function is minimized. For systems with homogeneous agents interconnected over sparse graphs, distributed controllers are proposed that inherit the same underlying graph as the one among agents. For the more general case, a relaxed optimization problem is considered so as to eliminate the nonlinear constraints. Using the subgradient method, interaction parameters among agents are optimized under the constraint of a sparse graph, and the optimum of the cost function is a better result than the one when agents interacted only through the control channel. Numerical examples are provided to validate the effectiveness of the method and to illustrate the geometrical performance of the system.',

	{'abstract': u"We present a novel mechanism to avoid congestion in complex networks based on local knowledge of traffic conditions and the ability of routers to self-coordinate their dynamical behavior. In particular, routers make use of local information about traffic conditions to either reject or accept information packets from their neighbors. We show that when nodes are only aware of their own congestion state they self-organize into a hierarchical configuration that delays remarkably the onset of congestion although, leading to a sharp first-order like congestion transition. We also consider the case when nodes are aware of the congestion state of their neighbors. In this case, we show that empathy between nodes is strongly beneficial to the overall performance of the system and it is possible to achieve larger values for the critical load together with a smooth, second-order like, transition. Finally, we show how local empathy minimize the impact of congestion as much as global minimization. Therefore, here we present an outstanding example of how local dynamical rules can optimize the system's functioning up to the levels reached using global knowledge.",

	{'abstract': u'We propose a semantically grounded theory of session types which relies on intersection and union types. We argue that intersection and union types are natural candidates for modeling branching points in session types and we show that the resulting theory overcomes some important defects of related behavioral theories. In particular, intersections and unions provide a native solution to the problem of computing joins and meets of session types. Also, the subtyping relation turns out to be a pre-congruence, while this is not always the case in related behavioral theories.',

	{'abstract': u'Many behavioural equivalences or preorders for probabilistic processes involve a lifting operation that turns a relation on states into a relation on distributions of states. We show that several existing proposals for lifting relations can be reconciled to be different presentations of essentially the same lifting operation. More interestingly, this lifting operation nicely corresponds to the Kantorovich metric, a fundamental concept used in mathematics to lift a metric on states to a metric on distributions of states, besides the fact the lifting operation is related to the maximum flow problem in optimisation theory. The lifting operation yields a neat notion of probabilistic bisimulation, for which we provide logical, metric, and algorithmic characterisations. Specifically, we extend the Hennessy-Milner logic and the modal mu-calculus with a new modality, resulting in an adequate and an expressive logic for probabilistic bisimilarity, respectively. The correspondence of the lifting operation and the Kantorovich metric leads to a natural characterisation of bisimulations as pseudometrics which are post-fixed points of a monotone function. We also present an "on the fly" algorithm to check if two states in a finitary system are related by probabilistic bisimilarity, exploiting the close relationship between the lifting operation and the maximum flow problem.',

	{'abstract': u'Intersection and union types denote conjunctions and disjunctions of properties. Using bidirectional typechecking, intersection types are relatively straightforward, but union types present challenges. For union types, we can case-analyze a subterm of union type when it appears in evaluation position (replacing the subterm with a variable, and checking that term twice under appropriate assumptions). This technique preserves soundness in a call-by-value semantics. Sadly, there are so many choices of subterms that a direct implementation is not practical. But carefully transforming programs into let-normal form drastically reduces the number of choices. The key results are soundness and completeness: a typing derivation (in the system with too many subterm choices) exists for a program if and only if a derivation exists for the let-normalized program.',

	{'abstract': u'In this paper we study the topological properties of wireless communication maps and their usability in algorithmic design. We consider the SINR model, which compares the received power of a signal at a receiver against the sum of strengths of other interfering signals plus background noise. To describe the behavior of a multi-station network, we use the convenient representation of a emph. In the SINR model, the resulting emph partitions the plane into reception zones, one per station, and the complementary region of the plane where no station can be heard. We consider the general case where transmission energies are arbitrary (or non-uniform). Under that setting, the reception zones are not necessarily convex or even connected. This poses the algorithmic challenge of designing efficient point location techniques as well as the theoretical challenge of understanding the geometry of SINR diagrams. We achieve several results in both directions. We establish a form of weaker convexity in the case where stations are aligned on a line. In addition, one of our key results concerns the behavior of a -dimensional map. Specifically, although the -dimensional map might be highly fractured, drawing the map in one dimension higher "heals" the zones, which become connected. In addition, as a step toward establishing a weaker form of convexity for the -dimensional map, we study the interference function and show that it satisfies the maximum principle. Finally, we turn to consider algorithmic applications, and propose a new variant of approximate point location.',

	{'abstract': u'The normalized maximum likelihood (NML) is a recent penalized likelihood that has properties that justify defining the amount of discrimination information (DI) in the data supporting an alternative hypothesis over a null hypothesis as the logarithm of an NML ratio, namely, the alternative hypothesis NML divided by the null hypothesis NML. The resulting DI, like the Bayes factor but unlike the p-value, measures the strength of evidence for an alternative hypothesis over a null hypothesis such that the probability of misleading evidence vanishes asymptotically under weak regularity conditions and such that evidence can support a simple null hypothesis. Unlike the Bayes factor, the DI does not require a prior distribution and is minimax optimal in a sense that does not involve averaging over outcomes that did not occur. Replacing a (possibly pseudo-) likelihood function with its weighted counterpart extends the scope of the DI to models for which the unweighted NML is undefined. The likelihood weights leverage side information, either in data associated with comparisons other than the comparison at hand or in the parameter value of a simple null hypothesis. Two case studies, one involving multiple populations and the other involving multiple biological features, indicate that the DI is robust to the type of side information used when that information is assigned the weight of a single observation. Such robustness suggests that very little adjustment for multiple comparisons is warranted if the sample size is at least moderate.',

	{'abstract': u'We define a type system with intersection types for an extension of lambda-calculus with unbind and rebind operators. In this calculus, a term with free variables, representing open code, can be packed into an "unbound" term, and passed around as a value. In order to execute inside code, an unbound term should be explicitly rebound at the point where it is used. Unbinding and rebinding are hierarchical, that is, the term can contain arbitrarily nested unbound terms, whose inside code can only be executed after a sequence of rebinds has been applied. Correspondingly, types are decorated with levels, and a term has type decorated with k if it needs k rebinds in order to reduce to a value. With intersection types we model the fact that a term can be used differently in contexts providing different numbers of unbinds. In particular, top-level terms, that is, terms not requiring unbinds to reduce to values, should have a value type, that is, an intersection type where at least one element has level 0. With the proposed intersection type system we get soundness under the call-by-value strategy, an issue which was not resolved by previous type systems.',

	{'abstract': u'A recently introduced novel community detection strategy is based on a label propagation algorithm (LPA) which uses the diffusion of information in the network to identify communities. Studies of LPAs showed that the strategy is effective in finding a good community structure. Label propagation step can be performed in parallel on all nodes (synchronous model) or sequentially (asynchronous model); both models present some drawback, e.g., algorithm termination is nor granted in the first case, performances can be worst in the second case. In this paper, we present a semi-synchronous version of LPA which aims to combine the advantages of both synchronous and asynchronous models. We prove that our models always converge to a stable labeling. Moreover, we experimentally investigate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy comparing its performance with the asynchronous model both in terms of quality, efficiency and stability. Tests show that the proposed protocol does not harm the quality of the partitioning. Moreover it is quite efficient; each propagation step is extremely parallelizable and it is more stable than the asynchronous model, thanks to the fact that only a small amount of randomization is used by our proposal.',

	{'abstract': u"While a user's preference is directly reflected in the interactive choice process between her and the recommender, this wealth of information was not fully exploited for learning recommender models. In particular, existing collaborative filtering (CF) approaches take into account only the binary events of user actions but totally disregard the contexts in which users' decisions are made. In this paper, we propose Collaborative Competitive Filtering (CCF), a framework for learning user preferences by modeling the choice process in recommender systems. CCF employs a multiplicative latent factor model to characterize the dyadic utility function. But unlike CF, CCF models the user behavior of choices by encoding a local competition effect. In this way, CCF allows us to leverage dyadic data that was previously lumped together with missing data in existing CF models. We present two formulations and an efficient large scale optimization algorithm. Experiments on three real-world recommendation data sets demonstrate that CCF significantly outperforms standard CF approaches in both offline and online evaluations.",

	{'abstract': u'The intersection type assignment system has been designed directly as deductive system for assigning formulae of the implicative and conjunctive fragment of the intuitionistic logic to terms of lambda-calculus. But its relation with the logic is not standard. Between all the logics that have been proposed as its foundation, we consider ISL, which gives a logical interpretation of the intersection by splitting the intuitionistic conjunction into two connectives, with a local and global behaviour respectively, being the intersection the local one. We think ISL is a logic interesting by itself, and in order to support this claim we give a sequent calculus formulation of it, and we prove that it enjoys the cut elimination property.',

	{'abstract': u'In this paper, we study resource allocation and adaptive modulation in SC-FDMA which is adopted as the multiple access scheme for the uplink in the 3GPP-LTE standard. A sum-utility maximization (SUmax), and a joint adaptive modulation and sum-cost minimization (JAMSCmin) problems are considered. Unlike OFDMA, in addition to the restriction of allocating a sub-channel to one user at most, the multiple sub-channels allocated to a user in SC-FDMA should be consecutive as well. This renders the resource allocation problem prohibitively difficult and the standard optimization tools (e.g., Lagrange dual approach widely used for OFDMA, etc.) can not help towards its optimal solution. We propose a novel optimization framework for the solution of these problems that is inspired from the recently developed canonical duality theory. We first formulate the optimization problems as binary-integer programming problems and then transform these binary-integer programming problems into continuous space canonical dual problems that are concave maximization problems. Based on the solution of the continuous space dual problems, we derive resource allocation (joint with adaptive modulation for JAMSCmin) algorithms for both the problems which have polynomial complexities. We provide conditions under which the proposed algorithms are optimal. We also propose an adaptive modulation scheme for SUmax problem. We compare the proposed algorithms with the existing algorithms in the literature to assess their performance.',

	{'abstract': u'In many practical situations we would like to estimate the covariance matrix of a set of variables from an insufficient amount of data. More specifically, if we have a set of independent, identically distributed measurements of an dimensional random vector the maximum likelihood estimate is the sample covariance matrix. Here we consider the case where such that this estimate is singular and therefore fundamentally bad. We present a radically new approach to deal with this situation. Let be the data matrix, where the columns are the independent realizations of the random vector with covariance matrix . Without loss of generality, we can assume that the random variables have zero mean. We would like to estimate from . Let be the classical sample covariance matrix. Fix a parameter and consider an ensemble of random unitary matrices, , having Haar probability measure. Pre and post multiply by , and by the conjugate transpose of respectively, to produce a non--singular reduced dimension covariance estimate. A new estimate for , denoted by , is obtained by a) projecting the reduced covariance estimate out (to ) through pre and post multiplication by the conjugate transpose of , and by respectively, and b) taking the expectation over the unitary ensemble. Another new estimate (this time for ), , is obtained by a) inverting the reduced covariance estimate, b) projecting the inverse out (to ) through pre and post multiplication by the conjugate transpose of , and by respectively, and c) taking the expectation over the unitary ensemble.

	{'abstract': u"Type theories with higher-order subtyping or singleton types are examples of systems where computation rules for variables are affected by type information in the context. A complication for these systems is that bounds declared in the context do not interact well with the logical relation proof of completeness or termination. This paper proposes a natural modification to the type syntax for F-Omega-Sub, adding variable's bound to the variable type constructor, thereby separating the computational behavior of the variable from the context. The algorithm for subtyping in F-Omega-Sub can then be given on types without context or kind information. As a consequence, the metatheory follows the general approach for type systems without computational information in the context, including a simple logical relation definition without Kripke-style indexing by context. This new presentation of the system is shown to be equivalent to the traditional presentation without bounds on the variable type constructor.",

	{'abstract': u'In this paper, we consider a robust lattice alignment design for K-user quasi-static MIMO interference channels with imperfect channel knowledge. With random Gaussian inputs, the conventional interference alignment (IA) method has the feasibility problem when the channel is quasi-static. On the other hand, structured lattices can create structured interference as opposed to the random interference caused by random Gaussian symbols. The structured interference space can be exploited to transmit the desired signals over the gaps. However, the existing alignment methods on the lattice codes for quasi-static channels either require infinite SNR or symmetric interference channel coefficients. Furthermore, perfect channel state information (CSI) is required for these alignment methods, which is difficult to achieve in practice. In this paper, we propose a robust lattice alignment method for quasi-static MIMO interference channels with imperfect CSI at all SNR regimes, and a two-stage decoding algorithm to decode the desired signal from the structured interference space. We derive the achievable data rate based on the proposed robust lattice alignment method, where the design of the precoders, decorrelators, scaling coefficients and interference quantization coefficients is jointly formulated as a mixed integer and continuous optimization problem. The effect of imperfect CSI is also accommodated in the optimization formulation, and hence the derived solution is robust to imperfect CSI. We also design a low complex iterative optimization algorithm for our robust lattice alignment method by using the existing iterative IA algorithm that was designed for the conventional IA method. Numerical results verify the advantages of the proposed robust lattice alignment method.',

	{'abstract': u'To comprehend the hierarchical organization of large integrated systems, we introduce the hierarchical map equation, which reveals multilevel structures in networks. In this information-theoretic approach, we exploit the duality between compression and pattern detection; by compressing a description of a random walker as a proxy for real flow on a network, we find regularities in the network that induce this system-wide flow. Finding the shortest multilevel description of the random walker therefore gives us the best hierarchical clustering of the network, the optimal number of levels and modular partition at each level, with respect to the dynamics on the network. With a novel search algorithm, we extract and illustrate the rich multilevel organization of several large social and biological networks. For example, from the global air traffic network we uncover countries and continents, and from the pattern of scientific communication we reveal more than 100 scientific fields organized in four major disciplines: life sciences, physical sciences, ecology and earth sciences, and social sciences. In general, we find shallow hierarchical structures in globally interconnected systems, such as neural networks, and rich multilevel organizations in systems with highly separated regions, such as road networks.',

	{'abstract': u"Peer-to-Peer protocols currently form the most heavily used protocol class in the Internet, with BitTorrent, the most popular protocol for content distribution, as its flagship. A high number of studies and investigations have been undertaken to measure, analyse and improve the inner workings of the BitTorrent protocol. Approaches such as tracker message analysis, network probing and packet sniffing have been deployed to understand and enhance BitTorrent's internal behaviour. In this paper we present a novel approach that aims to collect, process and analyse large amounts of local peer information in BitTorrent swarms. We classify the information as periodic status information able to be monitored in real time and as verbose logging information to be used for subsequent analysis. We have designed and implemented a retrieval, storage and presentation infrastructure that enables easy analysis of BitTorrent protocol internals. Our approach can be employed both as a comparison tool, as well as a measurement system of how network characteristics and protocol implementation influence the overall BitTorrent swarm performance. We base our approach on a framework that allows easy swarm creation and control for different BitTorrent clients. With the help of a virtualized infrastructure and a client-server software layer we are able to create, command and manage large sized BitTorrent swarms. The framework allows a user to run, schedule, start, stop clients within a swarm and collect information regarding their behavior.",

	{'abstract': u"We investigate entanglement transmission over an unknown channel in the presence of a third party (called the adversary), which is enabled to choose the channel from a given set of memoryless but non-stationary channels without informing the legitimate sender and receiver about the particular choice that he made. This channel model is called arbitrarily varying quantum channel (AVQC). We derive a quantum version of Ahlswede's dichotomy for classical arbitrarily varying channels. This includes a regularized formula for the common randomness-assisted capacity for entanglement transmission of an AVQC. Quite surprisingly and in contrast to the classical analog of the problem involving the maximal and average error probability, we find that the capacity for entanglement transmission of an AVQC always equals its strong subspace transmission capacity. These results are accompanied by different notions of symmetrizability (zero-capacity conditions) as well as by conditions for an AVQC to have a capacity described by a single-letter formula. In he final part of the paper the capacity of the erasure-AVQC is computed and some light shed on the connection between AVQCs and zero-error capacities. Additionally, we show by entirely elementary and operational arguments motivated by the theory of AVQCs that the quantum, classical, and entanglement-assisted zero-error capacities of quantum channels are generically zero and are discontinuous at every positivity point.",

	{'abstract': u'In this paper we study gossip based information spreading with bounded message sizes. We use algebraic gossip to disseminate distinct messages to all nodes in a network. For arbitrary networks we provide a new upper bound for uniform algebraic gossip of rounds with high probability, where and are the diameter and the maximum degree in the network, respectively. For many topologies and selections of this bound improves previous results, in particular, for graphs with a constant maximum degree it implies that uniform gossip is emph and the stopping time is . To eliminate the factor of from the upper bound we propose a non-uniform gossip protocol, TAG, which is based on algebraic gossip and an arbitrary spanning tree protocol . The stopping time of TAG is , where is the stopping time of the spanning tree protocol, and is the diameter of the spanning tree. We provide two general cases in which this bound leads to an order optimal protocol. The first is for , where, using a simple gossip broadcast protocol that creates a spanning tree in at most linear time, we show that TAG finishes after rounds for any graph. The second uses a sophisticated, recent gossip protocol to build a fast spanning tree on graphs with large weak conductance. In turn, this leads to the optimally of TAG on these graphs for . The technique used in our proofs relies on queuing theory, which is an interesting approach that can be useful in future gossip analysis.',

	{'abstract': u'Discrepancy measures how uniformly distributed a point set is with respect to a given set of ranges. There are two notions of discrepancy, namely continuous discrepancy and combinatorial discrepancy. Depending on the ranges, several possible variants arise, for example star discrepancy, box discrepancy, and discrepancy of half-spaces. In this paper, we investigate the hardness of these problems with respect to the dimension d of the underlying space. All these problems are solvable in time , but such a time dependency quickly becomes intractable for high-dimensional data. Thus it is interesting to ask whether the dependency on d can be moderated. We answer this question negatively by proving that the canonical decision problems are W[1]-hard with respect to the dimension. This is done via a parameterized reduction from the Clique problem. As the parameter stays linear in the input parameter, the results moreover imply that these problems require time, unless 3-Sat can be solved in time. Further, we derive that testing whether a given set is an -net with respect to half-spaces takes time under the same assumption. As intermediate results, we discover the W[1]-hardness of other well known problems, such as determining the largest empty star inside the unit cube. For this, we show that it is even hard to approximate within a factor of .',

	{'abstract': u'Complex systems are very often organized under the form of networks where nodes and edges are embedded in space. Transportation and mobility networks, Internet, mobile phone networks, power grids, social and contact networks, neural networks, are all examples where space is relevant and where topology alone does not contain all the information. Characterizing and understanding the structure and the evolution of spatial networks is thus crucial for many different fields ranging from urbanism to epidemiology. An important consequence of space on networks is that there is a cost associated to the length of edges which in turn has dramatic effects on the topological structure of these networks. We will expose thoroughly the current state of our understanding of how the spatial constraints affect the structure and properties of these networks. We will review the most recent empirical observations and the most important models of spatial networks. We will also discuss various processes which take place on these spatial networks, such as phase transitions, random walks, synchronization, navigation, resilience, and disease spread.',

Then we show how to perform witness extraction in this framework, by discussing several techniques depending on the shape of the existential formula.

Firstly, we describe an algorithm to label the vertices and the edges of the vertex set V(P_n^P_m) and the edge set E(P_n^P_m) respectively.

Artificial Intelligence scholars have dealt with the problem of MN by means of argumentations schemes, beliefs merging and information fusion operators, and ontology alignment but the proposed approaches depend upon the number of participants. In this paper, we give a general model of MN for an arbitrary number of agents, in which each participant discusses with the others her viewpoint by exhibiting it in an actual set of constraints on the meaning of the negotiated terms. We call this presentation of individual viewpoints an angle. The agents do not aim at forming a common viewpoint but, instead, at agreeing about an acceptable common angle. We analyze separately the process of MN by two agents ( emph or emph MN) and by more than two agents ( emph MN), and we use game theoretic models to understand how the process develops in both cases: the models are Bargaining Game for bilateral MN and English Auction for multiparty MN. We formalize the process of reaching such an agreement by giving a deduction system that comprises of rules that are consistent and adequate for representing MN.',

	{'abstract': u'Due to resource constraints of the sensor nodes, traditional public key cryptographic techniques are not feasible in most sensor network architectures. Several symmetric key distribution mechanisms are proposed for establishing pairwise keys between sensor nodes in sensor networks, but most of them are not scalable and also are not much suited for mobile sensor networks because they incur much communication as well as computational overheads. Moreover, these schemes are either vulnerable to a small number of compromised sensor nodes or involve expensive protocols for establishing keys. In this paper, we introduce a new scheme for establishing keys between sensor nodes with the help of additional high-end sensor nodes, called the auxiliary nodes. Our scheme provides unconditional security against sensor node captures and high network connectivity. In addition, our scheme requires minimal storage requirement for storing keys mainly due to only a single key before deployment in each node in the sensor network, supports efficiently addition of new nodes after initial deployment and also works for any deployment topology.',

	{'abstract': u"We consider an opportunistic spectrum access (OSA) problem where the time-varying condition of each channel (e.g., as a result of random fading or certain primary users' activities) is modeled as an arbitrary finite-state Markov chain. At each instance of time, a (secondary) user probes a channel and collects a certain reward as a function of the state of the channel (e.g., good channel condition results in higher data rate for the user). Each channel has potentially different state space and statistics, both unknown to the user, who tries to learn which one is the best as it goes and maximizes its usage of the best channel. The objective is to construct a good online learning algorithm so as to minimize the difference between the user's performance in total rewards and that of using the best channel (on average) had it known which one is the best from a priori knowledge of the channel statistics (also known as the regret). This is a classic exploration and exploitation problem and results abound when the reward processes are assumed to be iid. Compared to prior work, the biggest difference is that in our case the reward process is assumed to be Markovian, of which iid is a special case. In addition, the reward processes are restless in that the channel conditions will continue to evolve independent of the user's actions. This leads to a restless bandit problem, for which there exists little result on either algorithms or performance bounds in this learning context to the best of our knowledge. In this paper we introduce an algorithm that utilizes regenerative cycles of a Markov chain and computes a sample-mean based index policy, and show that under mild conditions on the state transition probabilities of the Markov chains this algorithm achieves logarithmic regret uniformly over time, and that this regret bound is also optimal.",

We show formally that it is possible to make these iterations behave chaotically, as defined by Devaney, and thus we obtain the first neural networks proven chaotic. Several neural networks with different architectures are trained to exhibit a chaotical behavior.',

	{'abstract': u'Traditional design of mobile wireless networks mainly focuses on ubiquitous access and large capacity. However, as energy saving and environmental protection become a global demand and inevitable trend, wireless researchers and engineers need to shift their focus to energy-efficiency oriented design, that is, green radio. In this paper, we propose a framework for green radio research and integrate the fundamental issues that are currently scattered. The skeleton of the framework consists of four fundamental tradeoffs: deployment efficiency - energy efficiency tradeoff, spectrum efficiency - energy efficiency tradeoff, bandwidth - power tradeoff, and delay - power tradeoff. With the help of the four fundamental tradeoffs, we demonstrate that key network performance/cost indicators are all stringed together.',

	{'abstract': u'We consider a collection of prediction experiments, which are clustered in the sense that groups of experiments ex- hibit similar relationship between the predictor and response variables. The experiment clusters as well as the regres- sion relationships are unknown. The regression relation- ships define the experiment clusters, and in general, the predictor and response variables may not exhibit any clus- tering. We call this prediction problem clustered regres- sion with unknown clusters (CRUC) and in this paper we focus on linear regression. We study and compare several methods for CRUC, demonstrate their applicability to the Yahoo Learning-to-rank Challenge (YLRC) dataset, and in- vestigate an associated mathematical model. CRUC is at the crossroads of many prior works and we study several prediction algorithms with diverse origins: an adaptation of the expectation-maximization algorithm, an approach in- spired by K-means clustering, the singular value threshold- ing approach to matrix rank minimization under quadratic constraints, an adaptation of the Curds and Whey method in multiple regression, and a local regression (LoR) scheme reminiscent of neighborhood methods in collaborative filter- ing. Based on empirical evaluation on the YLRC dataset as well as simulated data, we identify the LoR method as a good practical choice: it yields best or near-best prediction performance at a reasonable computational load, and it is less sensitive to the choice of the algorithm parameter. We also provide some analysis of the LoR method for an asso- ciated mathematical model, which sheds light on optimal parameter choice and prediction performance.',

	{'abstract': u'This work studies the Gaussian interference channel (IC) with a relay, which transmits and receives in a band that is orthogonal to the IC. The channel associated with the relay is thus an out-of-band relay channel (OBRC). The focus is on a symmetric channel model, in order to assess the fundamental impact of the OBRC on the signal interaction of the IC, in the simplest possible setting. First, the linear deterministic model is investigated and the sum capacity of this channel is established for all possible channel parameters. In particular, it is observed that the impact of OBRC, as its links get stronger, is similar to that of output feedback for the IC. The insights obtained from the deterministic model are then used to design achievable schemes for the Gaussian model. The interference links are classified as extremely strong, very strong, strong, moderate, weak, and very weak. For strong and moderate interference, separate encoding is near optimal. For very strong and extremely strong interference, the interference links provide side information to the destinations, which can help the transmission through the OBRC. For weak or very weak interference, an extension of the Han-Kobayashi scheme for the IC is utilized, where the messages are split into common and private. To achieve higher rates, it is beneficial to further split the common message into two parts, and the OBRC plays an important role in decoding the common message. It is shown that our strategy achieves the symmetric capacity to within 1.14625 bits per channel use with duplexing factor 0.5, and 1.27125 bits per channel use for arbitrary duplexing factors, for all channel parameters. An important observation from the constant gap result is that strong interference can be beneficial with the presence of an OBR.',

	{'abstract': u'This work establishes the design, analysis, and fine-tuning of a Peak-to-Average-Power-Ratio (PAPR) reducing system, based on compressed sensing at the receiver of a peak-reducing sparse clipper applied to an OFDM signal at the transmitter. By exploiting the sparsity of the OFDM signal in the time domain relative to a pre-defined clipping threshold, the method depends on partially observing the frequency content of extremely simple sparse clippers to recover the locations, magnitudes, and phases of the clipped coefficients of the peak-reduced signal. We claim that in the absence of optimization algorithms at the transmitter that confine the frequency support of clippers to a predefined set of reserved-tones, no other tone-reservation method can reliably recover the original OFDM signal with such low complexity. Afterwards we focus on designing different clipping signals that can embed a priori information regarding the support and phase of the peak-reducing signal to the receiver, followed by modified compressive sensing techniques for enhanced recovery. This includes data-based weighted 1 minimization for enhanced support recovery and phase-augmention for homogeneous clippers followed by Bayesian techniques. We show that using such techniques for a typical OFDM signal of 256 subcarriers and 20% reserved tones, the PAPR can be reduced by approximately 4.5 dB with a significant increase in capacity compared to a system which uses all its tones for data transmission and clips to such levels. The design is hence appealing from both capacity and PAPR reduction aspects.',

	{'abstract': u'The problem of stabilizing an unstable plant over a noisy communication link is an increasingly important one that arises in problems of distributed control and networked control systems. Although the work of Schulman and Sahai over the past two decades, and their development of the notions of "tree codes" and "anytime capacity", provides the theoretical framework for studying such problems, there has been scant practical progress in this area because explicit constructions of tree codes with efficient encoding and decoding did not exist. To stabilize an unstable plant driven by bounded noise over a noisy channel one needs real-time encoding and real-time decoding and a reliability which increases exponentially with delay, which is what tree codes guarantee. We prove the existence of linear tree codes with high probability and, for erasure channels, give an explicit construction with an expected encoding and decoding complexity that is constant per time instant. We give sufficient conditions on the rate and reliability required of the tree codes to stabilize vector plants and argue that they are asymptotically tight. This work takes a major step towards controlling plants over noisy channels, and we demonstrate the efficacy of the method through several examples.',

	{'abstract': u'Wireless networks with energy harvesting battery powered nodes are quickly emerging as a viable option for future wireless networks with extended lifetime. Equally important to their counterpart in the design of energy harvesting radios are the design principles that this new networking paradigm calls for. In particular, unlike wireless networks considered up to date, the energy replenishment process and the storage constraints of the rechargeable batteries need to be taken into account in designing efficient transmission strategies. In this work, we consider such transmission policies for rechargeable nodes, and identify the optimum solution for two related problems. Specifically, the transmission policy that maximizes the short term throughput, i.e., the amount of data transmitted in a finite time horizon is found. In addition, we show the relation of this optimization problem to another, namely, the minimization of the transmission completion time for a given amount of data, and solve that as well. The transmission policies are identified under the constraints on energy causality, i.e., energy replenishment process, as well as the energy storage, i.e., battery capacity. The power-rate relationship for this problem is assumed to be an increasing concave function, as dictated by information theory. For battery replenishment, a model with discrete packets of energy arrivals is considered. We derive the necessary conditions that the throughput-optimal allocation satisfies, and then provide the algorithm that finds the optimal transmission policy with respect to the short-term throughput and the minimum transmission completion time. Numerical results are presented to confirm the analytical findings.',

Generalizing the service times to the phase-type distribution makes the analysis of the supermarket models more difficult and challenging than that of the exponential service time case which has been extensively discussed in the literature. We first describe the supermarket model as a system of differential vector equations, and provide a doubly exponential solution to the fixed point of the system of differential vector equations. Then we analyze the exponential convergence of the current location of the supermarket model to its fixed point.

	{'abstract': u'The Diophantine Equation Hard Problem (DEHP) is a potential cryptographic problem on the Diophantine equation . A proper implementation of DEHP would render an attacker to search for private parameters amongst the exponentially many solutions. However, an improper implementation would provide an attacker exponentially many choices to solve the DEHP. The AA ,-cryptosystem is an asymmetric cryptographic scheme that utilizes this concept together with the factorization problem of two large primes and is implemented only by using the multiplication operation for both encryption and decryption. With this simple mathematical structure, it would have low computational requirements and would enable communication devices with low computing power to deploy secure communication procedures efficiently.',

	{'abstract': u"Statements of Shannon's Noiseless Coding Theorem by various authors, including the original, are reviewed and clarified. Traditional statements of the theorem are often unclear as to when it applies. A new notation is introduced and the domain of application is clarified. An examination of the bounds of the Theorem leads to a new symmetric restatement. It is shown that the extended upper bound is an acheivable upper bound, giving symmetry to the theorem.The relation of information entropy to the physical entropy of Gibbs and Boltmann is illustrated. Consequently, the study of Shannon Entropy is strongly related to physics and there is a physical theory of information. This paper is the beginning of of an attempt to clarify these relationships.",

	{'abstract': u'In this paper, we present the design of a scalable, distributed stream processing system for RFID tracking and monitoring. Since RFID data lacks containment and location information that is key to query processing, we propose to combine location and containment inference with stream query processing in a single architecture, with inference as an enabling mechanism for high-level query processing. We further consider challenges in instantiating such a system in large distributed settings and design techniques for distributed inference and query processing. Our experimental results, using both real-world data and large synthetic traces, demonstrate the accuracy, efficiency, and scalability of our proposed techniques.',

	{'abstract': u"In this paper we theoretically and empirically study the degree and connectivity of the Internet's scale-free topology at the autonomous system (AS) level. The basic features of the scale-free network have influence on the normalization constant of the degree distribution p(k). We develop a mathematics model of the Internet's scale-free topology. On this model we theoretically get the formulas of the average degree, the ratios of the kmin-degree (minimum degree) nodes and the kmax-degree (maximum degree) nodes, the fraction of the degrees (or links) in the hands of the richer (top best-connected) nodes. We find the average degree is larger for smaller power-law exponent and larger minimum or maximum degree. The ratio of the kmin-degree nodes is larger for larger and smaller kmin or kmax. The ratio of the kmax-degree ones is larger for smaller and kmax or larger kmin. The richer nodes hold most of the total degrees of the AS-level Internet topology. In addition, we reveal the ratio of the kmin-degree nodes or the rate of the increase of the average degree has power-law decay with the increase of the kmin. The ratio of the kmax-degree nodes has power-law decay with the increase of the kmax, and the fraction of the degrees in the hands of the richer 27% nodes is about 73% (the '73/27 rule'). At last, we empirically calculate, based on empirical data extracted from BGP, the average degree and the ratio and fraction using our method and other methods, and find that our method is rigorous and effective for the AS-level Internet topology.",

	{'abstract': u'In this paper, we introduce an efficient interference alignment (IA) algorithm exploiting partially coordinated transmit precoding to improve the number of concurrent interference-free transmissions, i.e., the multiplexing gain, in multicell downlink. The proposed coordination model is such that each base-station simultaneously transmits to two users and each user is served by two base-stations. First, we show in a K-user system operating at the information theoretic upper bound of degrees of freedom (DOF), the generic IA is proper when , whereas the proposed partially coordinated IA is proper when . Then, we derive a non-iterative, i.e., one shot, IA algorithm for the proposed scheme when . We show that for a given latency, the backhaul data rate requirement of the proposed method grows linearly with K. Monte-Carlo simulation results show that the proposed one-shot algorithm offers higher system throughput than the iterative IA at practical SNR levels.',

	{'abstract': u"This report outlines the use of a relational representation in a Multi-Agent domain to model the behaviour of the whole system. A desired property in this systems is the ability of the team members to work together to achieve a common goal in a cooperative manner. The aim is to define a systematic method to verify the effective collaboration among the members of a team and comparing the different multi-agent behaviours. Using external observations of a Multi-Agent System to analyse, model, recognize agent behaviour could be very useful to direct team actions. In particular, this report focuses on the challenge of autonomous unsupervised sequential learning of the team's behaviour from observations. Our approach allows to learn a symbolic sequence (a relational representation) to translate raw multi-agent, multi-variate observations of a dynamic, complex environment, into a set of sequential behaviours that are characteristic of the team in question, represented by a set of sequences expressed in first-order logic atoms. We propose to use a relational learning algorithm to mine meaningful frequent patterns among the relational sequences to characterise team behaviours. We compared the performance of two teams in the RoboCup four-legged league environment, that have a very different approach to the game. One uses a Case Based Reasoning approach, the other uses a pure reactive behaviour.",

	{'abstract': u'A directed graph is called Eulerian, if it contains a tour that traverses every arc in the graph exactly once. We study the problem of Eulerian extension (EE) where a directed multigraph G and a weight function is given and it is asked whether G can be made Eulerian by adding arcs whose total weight does not exceed a given threshold. This problem is motivated through applications in vehicle routing and flowshop scheduling. However, EE is NP-hard and thus we use the parameterized complexity framework to analyze it. In parameterized complexity, the running time of algorithms is considered not only with respect to input length, but also with respect to other properties of the input - called "parameters". Dorn et. al. proved that EE can be solved in O(4^k n^4) time, where k denotes the parameter "number of arcs that have to be added". In this thesis, we analyze EE with respect to the (smaller) parameters "number c of connected components in the input graph" and "sum b over indeg(v) - outdeg(v) for all vertices v in the input graph where this value is positive". We prove that there is an algorithm for EE whose running time is polynomial except for the term 4^(c log(bc^2)). To obtain this result, we make several observations about the sets of arcs that have to be added to the input graph in order to make it Eulerian. We build upon these observations to restate EE in a matching context. This matching formulation of EE might be an important tool to solve the question of whether EE can be solved within running time whose superpolynomial part depends only on c. We also consider polynomial time preprocessing routines for EE and show that these routines cannot yield instances whose size depends polynomially only on either of the parameters b, c, k unless coNP is contained in NP/poly.',

However, this offline pairwise key distribution mechanism requires that the network size be set in advance, and involves all sensor nodes simultaneously. Here, we address this issue by describing an implementation of the pairwise scheme that supports the gradual deployment of sensor nodes in several consecutive phases. We discuss the key ring size needed to maintain the secure connectivity throughout all the deployment phases. In particular we show that the number of keys at each sensor node can be taken to be in order to achieve secure connectivity (with high probability).',

	{'abstract': u'In this paper, we deal with low-complexity near-optimal detection/equalization in large-dimension multiple-input multiple-output inter-symbol interference (MIMO-ISI) channels using message passing on graphical models. A key contribution in the paper is the demonstration that near-optimal performance in MIMO-ISI channels with large dimensions can be achieved at low complexities through simple yet effective simplifications/approximations, although the graphical models that represent MIMO-ISI channels are fully/densely connected (loopy graphs). These include 1) use of Markov Random Field (MRF) based graphical model with pairwise interaction, in conjunction with , and 2) use of Factor Graph (FG) based graphical model with (GAI). The per-symbol complexities are and for the MRF and the FG with GAI approaches, respectively, where and denote the number of channel uses per frame, and number of transmit antennas, respectively. These low-complexities are quite attractive for large dimensions, i.e., for large . From a performance perspective, these algorithms are even more interesting in large-dimensions since they achieve increasingly closer to optimum detection performance for increasing . Also, we show that these message passing algorithms can be used in an iterative manner with local neighborhood search algorithms to improve the reliability/performance of -QAM symbol detection.',

	{'abstract': u'Designing an m-bar linkage with a maximal number of assembly modes is important in robot kinematics, and has further applications in structural biology and computational geometry. A related question concerns the number of assembly modes of rigid mechanisms as a function of their nodes n, which is uniquely defined given m. Rigid 11-bar linkages, where n=7, are the simplest planar linkages for which these questions were still open. It will be proven that the maximal number of assembly modes of such linkages is exactly 56. The rigidity of a linkage is captured by a polynomial system derived from distance, or Cayley-Menger, matrices. The upper bound on the number of assembly modes is obtained as the mixed volume of a 5x5 system. An 11-bar linkage admitting 56 configurations is constructed using stochastic optimisation methods. This yields a general lower bound of on the number of assembly modes, slightly improving the current record of , while the best known upper bound is roughly . Our methods are straightforward and have been implemented in Maple. They are described in general terms illustrating the fact that they can be readily extended to other planar or spatial linkages.',

	{'abstract': u'Communication Based Train Control (CBTC) system is the state-of-the-art train control system. In a CBTC system, to guarantee the safety of train operation, trains communicate with each other intensively and adjust their control modes autonomously by computing critical control parameters, e.g. velocity range, according to the information they get. As the correctness of the control parameters generated are critical to the safety of the system, a method to verify these parameters is a strong desire in the area of train control system. In this paper, we present our ideas of how to model and verify the control parameter calculations in a CBTC system efficiently. - As the behavior of the system is highly nondeterministic, it is difficult to build and verify the complete behavior space model of the system online in advance. Thus, we propose to model the system according to the ongoing behavior model induced by the control parameters. - As the parameters are generated online and updated very quickly, the verification result will be meaningless if it is given beyond the time bound, since by that time the model will be changed already. Thus, we propose a method to verify the existence of certain dangerous scenarios in the model online quickly. To demonstrate the feasibility of these proposed approaches, we present the composed linear hybrid automata with readable shared variables as a modeling language to model the control parameters calculation and give a path-oriented reachability analysis technique for the scenario-based verification of this model. We demonstrate the model built for the CBTC system, and show the performance of our technique in fast online verification. Last but not least, as CBTC system is a typical CPS system, we also give a short discussion of the potential directions for CPS verification in this paper.',

	{'abstract': u"We study a model of information aggregation and social learning recently proposed by Jadbabaie, Sandroni, and Tahbaz-Salehi, in which individual agents try to learn a correct state of the world by iteratively updating their beliefs using private observations and beliefs of their neighbors. No individual agent's private signal might be informative enough to reveal the unknown state. As a result, agents share their beliefs with others in their social neighborhood to learn from each other. At every time step each agent receives a private signal, and computes a Bayesian posterior as an intermediate belief. The intermediate belief is then averaged with the belief of neighbors to form the individual's belief at next time step. We find a set of minimal sufficient conditions under which the agents will learn the unknown state and reach consensus on their beliefs without any assumption on the private signal structure. The key enabler is a result that shows that using this update, agents will eventually forecast the indefinite future correctly.",

	{'abstract': u'In this paper we present a new routing paradigm that generalizes opportunistic routing for wireless multihop networks. In multirate anypath routing, each node uses both a set of next hops and a selected transmission rate to reach a destination. Using this rate, a packet is broadcast to the nodes in the set and one of them forwards the packet on to the destination. To date, there has been no theory capable of jointly optimizing both the set of next hops and the transmission rate used by each node. We solve this by introducing two polynomial-time routing algorithms and provide the proof of their optimality. The proposed algorithms run in roughly the same running time as regular shortest-path algorithms, and are therefore suitable for deployment in routing protocols. We conducted measurements in an 802.11b testbed network, and our trace-driven analysis shows that multirate anypath routing performs on average 80% and up to 6.4 times better than anypath routing with a fixed rate of 11 Mbps. If the rate is fixed at 1 Mbps instead, performance improves by up to one order of magnitude.',

	{'abstract': u'Starting from version 2.0, UML introduced hierarchical composite structures, which are an expressive way of defining complex software architectures, but which have a very loosely defined semantics in the standard. In this paper we propose a set of consistency rules that disambiguate the meaning of UML composite structures. Our primary goal was to have an operational model of composite structures for the OMEGA UML profile, an executable profile dedicated to the formal specification and validation of real-time systems, developed in a past project to which we contributed. However, the rules and principles stated here are applicable to other hierarchical component models based on the same concepts, such as SysML. The presented ruleset is supported by an OCL formalization which is described in this report. This formalization was applied on different complex models for the evaluation and validation of the proposed principles.',

	{'abstract': u'FIT stands for Foundations of Interface Technologies. Component-based design is widely considered as a major approach to developing systems in a time and cost effective way. Central in this approach is the notion of an interface. Interfaces summarize the externally visible properties of a component and are seen as a key to achieving component interoperability and to predict global system behavior based on the component behavior. To capture the intricacy of complex software products, rich interfaces have been proposed. These interfaces do not only specify syntactic properties, such as the signatures of methods and operations, but also take into account behavioral and extra-functional properties, such as quality of service, security and dependability. Rich interfaces have been proposed for describing, e.g., the legal sequences of messages or method calls accepted by components, or the resource and timing constraints in embedded software. The development of a rigorous framework for the specification and analysis of rich interfaces is challenging. The aim of this workshop is to bring together researchers who are interested in the formal underpinnings of interface technologies',

We find that in contrast to quantum key distribution schemes, the high fidelity of the raw key generated in classical systems allow the users to always sift a secure shorter key if they have an upper bound on the eavesdropper probability to correctly guess the exchanged key-bits. The number of privacy amplification iterations needed to achieve information leak of 10^-8 in existing classical communicators is 2 or 3 resulting in a corresponding slowdown 4 to 8. We analyze the inherent tradeoff between the number of iterations and the security of the raw key. This property which is unique to classical key distribution systems render them highly useful for practical, especially for noisy channels where sufficiently low quantum bit error ratios are difficult to achieve.',

	{'abstract': u'In this paper, we develop a method to automatically generate a control policy for a dynamical system modeled as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). The control specification is given as a Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) formula over a set of propositions defined on the states of the MDP. We synthesize a control policy such that the MDP satisfies the given specification almost surely, if such a policy exists. In addition, we designate an "optimizing proposition" to be repeatedly satisfied, and we formulate a novel optimization criterion in terms of minimizing the expected cost in between satisfactions of this proposition. We propose a sufficient condition for a policy to be optimal, and develop a dynamic programming algorithm that synthesizes a policy that is optimal under some conditions, and sub-optimal otherwise. This problem is motivated by robotic applications requiring persistent tasks, such as environmental monitoring or data gathering, to be performed.',

	{'abstract': u"This paper proposes a new approach to multisensor data fusion, suggesting by considering information about the sensors' different characteristics, aggregation of data acquired by individual sensors can be done more efficient. Same as the most effective sensors' characteristics, especially in control systems, our focus is on sensors' accuracy and frequency response. A rule-based fuzzy system is presented for fusion of raw data obtained from the sensors having complement characteristics in accuracy and bandwidth. Furthermore, a fuzzy predictor system is also suggested aiming to extremely high accuracy for highly sensitive applications. The great advantages of the proposed sensor fusion system are revealed on simulation results of a control system utilizing the fusion system for output estimation.",

	{'abstract': u'In this paper, we introduce two new achievable schemes for the fading multiple access wiretap channel (MAC-WT). In the model that we consider, we assume that perfect knowledge of the state of all channels is available at all the nodes in a causal fashion. Our schemes use this knowledge together with the time varying nature of the channel model to align the interference from different users at the eavesdropper perfectly in a one-dimensional space while creating a higher dimensionality space for the interfering signals at the legitimate receiver hence allowing for better chance of recovery. While we achieve this alignment through signal scaling at the transmitters in our first scheme (scaling based alignment (SBA)), we let nature provide this alignment through the ergodicity of the channel coefficients in the second scheme (ergodic secret alignment (ESA)). For each scheme, we obtain the resulting achievable secrecy rate region. We show that the secrecy rates achieved by both schemes scale with SNR as 1/2log(SNR). Hence, we show the sub-optimality of the i.i.d. Gaussian signaling based schemes with and without cooperative jamming by showing that the secrecy rates achieved using i.i.d. Gaussian signaling with cooperative jamming do not scale with SNR. In addition, we introduce an improved version of our ESA scheme where we incorporate cooperative jamming to achieve higher secrecy rates. Moreover, we derive the necessary optimality conditions for the power control policy that maximizes the secrecy sum rate achievable by our ESA scheme when used solely and with cooperative jamming.',

	{'abstract': u'Recently, it was observed that spatially-coupled LDPC code ensembles approach the Shannon capacity for a class of binary-input memoryless symmetric (BMS) channels. The fundamental reason for this was attributed to a "threshold saturation" phenomena derived by Kudekar, Richardson and Urbanke. In particular, it was shown that the belief propagation (BP) threshold of the spatially coupled codes is equal to the maximum a posteriori (MAP) decoding threshold of the underlying constituent codes. In this sense, the BP threshold is saturated to its maximum value. Moreover, it has been empirically observed that the same phenomena also occurs when transmitting over more general classes of BMS channels. In this paper, we show that the effect of spatial coupling is not restricted to the realm of channel coding. The effect of coupling also manifests itself in compressed sensing. Specifically, we show that spatially-coupled measurement matrices have an improved sparsity to sampling threshold for reconstruction algorithms based on verification decoding. For BP-based reconstruction algorithms, this phenomenon is also tested empirically via simulation. At the block lengths accessible via simulation, the effect is quite small and it seems that spatial coupling is not providing the gains one might expect. Based on the threshold analysis, however, we believe this warrants further study.',

	{'abstract': u"Reversible logic has promising applications in emerging nanotechnologies, such as quantum computing, quantum dot cellular automata and optical computing, etc. Faults in reversible logic circuits that result in multi-bit error at the outputs are very tough to detect, and thus in literature, researchers have only addressed the problem of online testing of faults that result single-bit error at the outputs based on parity preserving logic. In this work, we propose a methodology for the concurrent error detection in reversible logic circuits to detect faults that can result in multi-bit error at the outputs. The methodology is based on the inverse property of reversible logic and is termed as 'inverse and compare' method. By using the inverse property of reversible logic, all the inputs can be regenerated at the outputs. Thus, by comparing the original inputs with the regenerated inputs, the faults in reversible circuits can be detected. Minimizing the garbage outputs is one of the main goals in reversible logic design and synthesis. We show that the proposed methodology results in 'garbageless' reversible circuits. A design of reversible full adder that can be concurrently tested for multi-bit error at the outputs is illustrated as the application of the proposed scheme. Finally, we showed the application of the proposed scheme of concurrent error detection towards fault detection in quantum dot cellular automata (QCA) emerging nanotechnology.",

	{'abstract': u'In this paper, we consider the problem of link scheduling in multi-hop wireless networks under general interference constraints. Our goal is to design scheduling schemes that do not use per-flow or per-destination information, maintain a single data queue for each link, and exploit only local information, while guaranteeing throughput optimality. Although the celebrated back-pressure algorithm maximizes throughput, it requires per-flow or per-destination information. It is usually difficult to obtain and maintain this type of information, especially in large networks, where there are numerous flows. Also, the back-pressure algorithm maintains a complex data structure at each node, keeps exchanging queue length information among neighboring nodes, and commonly results in poor delay performance. In this paper, we propose scheduling schemes that can circumvent these drawbacks and guarantee throughput optimality. These schemes use either the readily available hop-count information or only the local information for each link. We rigorously analyze the performance of the proposed schemes using fluid limit techniques via an inductive argument and show that they are throughput-optimal. We also conduct simulations to validate our theoretical results in various settings, and show that the proposed schemes can substantially improve the delay performance in most scenarios.',

	{'abstract': u'In this paper we present a framework for the rendering of dynamic 3D virtual environments which can be integrated in the development of videogames. It includes methods to manage sounds and particle effects, paged static geometries, the support of a physics engine and various input systems. It has been designed with a modular structure to allow future expansions. We exploited some open-source state-of-the-art components such as OGRE, PhysX, ParticleUniverse, etc.; all of them have been properly integrated to obtain peculiar physical and environmental effects. The stand-alone version of the application is fully compatible with Direct3D and OpenGL APIs and adopts OpenAL APIs to manage audio cards. Concluding, we devised a showcase demo which reproduces a dynamic 3D environment, including some particular effects: the alternation of day and night infuencing the lighting of the scene, the rendering of terrain, water and vegetation, the reproduction of sounds and atmospheric agents.',

	{'abstract': u"The purpose of this article is to introduce a new analytical framework dedicated to measuring performance of recommender systems. The standard approach is to assess the quality of a system by means of accuracy related statistics. However, the specificity of the environments in which recommender systems are deployed requires to pay much attention to speed and memory requirements of the algorithms. Unfortunately, it is implausible to assess accurately the complexity of various algorithms with formal tools. This can be attributed to the fact that such analyses are usually based on an assumption of dense representation of underlying data structures. Whereas, in real life the algorithms operate on sparse data and are implemented with collections dedicated for them. Therefore, we propose to measure the complexity of recommender systems with artificial datasets that posses real-life properties. We utilize recently developed bipartite graph generator to evaluate how state-of-the-art recommender systems' behavior is determined and diversified by topological properties of the generated datasets.",

	{'abstract': u'We consider the problem of channel estimation for amplify-and-forward (AF) two-way relay networks (TWRNs). Most works on this problem focus on pilot-based approaches which impose a significant training overhead that reduces the spectral efficiency of the system. To avoid such losses, this work proposes blind channel estimation algorithms for AF TWRNs that employ constant-modulus (CM) signaling. Our main algorithm is based on the deterministic maximum likelihood (DML) approach. Assuming M-PSK modulation, we show that the resulting estimator is consistent and approaches the true channel with high probability at high SNR for modulation orders higher than 2. For BPSK, however, the DML performs poorly and we propose an alternative algorithm that performs much better by taking into account the BPSK structure of the data symbols. For comparative purposes, we also investigate the Gaussian maximum-likelihood (GML) approach which treats the data symbols as Gaussian-distributed nuisance parameters. We derive the Cramer-Rao bound and use Monte-Carlo simulations to investigate the mean squared error (MSE) performance of the proposed algorithms. We also compare the symbol-error rate (SER) performance of the DML algorithm with that of the training-based least-squares (LS) algorithm and demonstrate that the DML offers a superior tradeoff between accuracy and spectral efficiency.',

	{'abstract': u'Multi-cell cooperation is a promising approach for mitigating inter-cell interference in dense cellular networks. Quantifying the performance of multi-cell cooperation is challenging as it integrates physical-layer techniques and network topologies. For tractability, existing work typically relies on the over-simplified Wyner-type models. In this paper, we propose a new stochastic-geometry model for a cellular network with multi-cell cooperation, which accounts for practical factors including the irregular locations of base stations (BSs) and the resultant path-losses. In particular, the proposed network-topology model has three key features: i) the cells are modeled using a Poisson random tessellation generated by Poisson distributed BSs, ii) multi-antenna BSs are clustered using a hexagonal lattice and BSs in the same cluster mitigate mutual interference by spatial interference avoidance, iii) BSs near cluster edges access a different sub-channel from that by other BSs, shielding cluster-edge mobiles from strong interference. Using this model and assuming sparse scattering, we analyze the shapes of the outage probabilities of mobiles served by cluster-interior BSs as the average number of BSs per cluster increases. The outage probability of a mobile near a cluster center is shown to be proportional to where is the fraction of BSs lying in the interior of clusters and is a constant. Moreover, the outage probability of a typical mobile is proved to scale proportionally with where is a constant.',

	{'abstract': u'Determining a Nash equilibrium in a -player non-zero sum game is known to be PPAD-hard (Chen and Deng (2006), Chen, Deng and Teng (2009)). The problem, even when restricted to win-lose bimatrix games, remains PPAD-hard (Abbott, Kane and Valiant (2005)). However, there do exist polynomial time tractable classes of win-lose bimatrix games - such as, very sparse games (Codenotti, Leoncini and Resta (2006)) and planar games (Addario-Berry, Olver and Vetta (2007)). We extend the results in the latter work to minor-free games and a subclass of minor-free games. Both these classes of games strictly contain planar games. Further, we sharpen the upper bound to unambiguous logspace, a small complexity class contained well within polynomial time. Apart from these classes of games, our results also extend to a class of games that contain both and as minors, thereby covering a large and non-trivial class of win-lose bimatrix games. For this class, we prove an upper bound of nondeterministic logspace, again a small complexity class within polynomial time. Our techniques are primarily graph theoretic and use structural characterizations of the considered minor-closed families.',

	{'abstract': u'We propose deterministic timed automata (DTA) as a model-independent language for specifying performance and dependability measures over continuous-time stochastic processes. Technically, these measures are defined as limit frequencies of locations (control states) of a DTA that observes computations of a given stochastic process. Then, we study the properties of DTA measures over semi-Markov processes in greater detail. We show that DTA measures over semi-Markov processes are well-defined with probability one, and there are only finitely many values that can be assumed by these measures with positive probability. We also give an algorithm which approximates these values and the associated probabilities up to an arbitrarily small given precision. Thus, we obtain a general and effective framework for analysing DTA measures over semi-Markov processes.',

Therefore, artificial datasets are needed to enhance development and testing of the algorithms. We are particularly interested in applying the generator to the analysis of recommender systems.

We show in particular that, for a large class of normalization strategies, it is possible to focus only on belief convergence. Following this, we express the necessary and sufficient conditions for local stability of a fixed point in terms of the graph structure and the beliefs values at the fixed point. We also explicit some connexion between the normalization constants and the underlying Bethe Free Energy.',

	{'abstract': u"In this paper, we study the Nash dynamics of strategic interplays of n buyers in a matching market setup by a seller, the market maker. Taking the standard market equilibrium approach, upon receiving submitted bid vectors from the buyers, the market maker will decide on a price vector to clear the market in such a way that each buyer is allocated an item for which he desires the most (a.k.a., a market equilibrium solution). While such equilibrium outcomes are not unique, the market maker chooses one (maxeq) that optimizes its own objective --- revenue maximization. The buyers in turn change bids to their best interests in order to obtain higher utilities in the next round's market equilibrium solution. This is an (n+1)-person game where buyers place strategic bids to gain the most from the market maker's equilibrium mechanism. The incentives of buyers in deciding their bids and the market maker's choice of using the maxeq mechanism create a wave of Nash dynamics involved in the market. We characterize Nash equilibria in the dynamics in terms of the relationship between maxeq and mineq (i.e., minimum revenue equilibrium), and develop convergence results for Nash dynamics from the maxeq policy to a mineq solution, resulting an outcome equivalent to the truthful VCG mechanism. Our results imply revenue equivalence between maxeq and mineq, and address the question that why short-term revenue maximization is a poor long run strategy, in a deterministic and dynamic setting.",

	{'abstract': u"Takens' Embedding Theorem remarkably established that concatenating M previous outputs of a dynamical system into a vector (called a delay coordinate map) can be a one-to-one mapping of a low-dimensional attractor from the system state space. However, Takens' theorem is fragile in the sense that even small imperfections can induce arbitrarily large errors in this attractor representation. We extend Takens' result to establish deterministic, explicit and non-asymptotic sufficient conditions for a delay coordinate map to form a stable embedding in the restricted case of linear dynamical systems and observation functions. Our work is inspired by the field of Compressive Sensing (CS), where results guarantee that low-dimensional signal families can be robustly reconstructed if they are stably embedded by a measurement operator. However, in contrast to typical CS results, i) our sufficient conditions are independent of the size of the ambient state space, and ii) some system and measurement pairs have fundamental limits on the conditioning of the embedding (i.e., how close it is to an isometry), meaning that further measurements beyond some point add no further significant value. We use several simple simulations to explore the conditions of the main results, including the tightness of the bounds and the convergence speed of the stable embedding. We also present an example task of estimating the attractor dimension from time-series data to highlight the value of stable embeddings over traditional Takens' embeddings.",

	{'abstract': u"Over finite words, languages of dot-depth one are expressively complete for alternation-free first-order logic. This fragment is also known as the Boolean closure of existential first-order logic. Here, the atomic formulas comprise order, successor, minimum, and maximum predicates. Knast (1983) has shown that it is decidable whether a language has dot-depth one. We extend Knast's result to infinite words. In particular, we describe the class of languages definable in alternation-free first-order logic over infinite words, and we give an effective characterization of this fragment. This characterization has two components. The first component is identical to Knast's algebraic property for finite words and the second component is a topological property, namely being a Boolean combination of Cantor sets. As an intermediate step we consider finite and infinite words simultaneously. We then obtain the results for infinite words as well as for finite words as special cases. In particular, we give a new proof of Knast's Theorem on languages of dot-depth one over finite words.",

	{'abstract': u'Eigenvectors of data matrices play an important role in many computational problems, ranging from signal processing to machine learning and control. For instance, algorithms that compute positions of the nodes of a wireless network on the basis of pairwise distance measurements require a few leading eigenvectors of the distances matrix. While eigenvector calculation is a standard topic in numerical linear algebra, it becomes challenging under severe communication or computation constraints, or in absence of central scheduling. In this paper we investigate the possibility of computing the leading eigenvectors of a large data matrix through gossip algorithms. The proposed algorithm amounts to iteratively multiplying a vector by independent random sparsification of the original matrix and averaging the resulting normalized vectors. This can be viewed as a generalization of gossip algorithms for consensus, but the resulting dynamics is significantly more intricate. Our analysis is based on controlling the convergence to stationarity of the associated Kesten-Furstenberg Markov chain.',

The main use case envisioned for GridCertLib, is to provide seamless and secure access to Grid/X.509 certificates and proxies in web applications and portals: when a user logs in to the portal using Shibboleth authentication, GridCertLib can automatically obtain a Grid/X.509 certificate from the SLCS service and generate a VOMS proxy from it. We give an overview of the architecture of GridCertLib and briefly describe its programming model. Its application to some deployment scenarios is outlined, as well as a report on practical experience integrating GridCertLib into portals for Bioinformatics and Computational Chemistry applications, based on the popular P-GRADE and Django softwares.',

	{'abstract': u'This paper studies the noncausal relay channel, also known as the relay channel with unlimited lookahead, introduced by El Gamal, Hassanpour, and Mammen. Unlike the standard relay channel model, where the relay encodes its signal based on the previous received output symbols, the relay in the noncausal relay channel encodes its signal as a function of the entire received sequence. In the existing coding schemes, the relay uses this noncausal information solely to recover the transmitted message and then cooperates with the sender to communicate this message to the receiver. However, it is shown in this paper that by applying the Gelfand--Pinsker coding scheme, the relay can take further advantage of the noncausally available information, which can achieve strictly higher rates than existing coding schemes. This paper also provides a new upper bound on the capacity of the noncausal relay that strictly improves upon the cutset bound. These new lower and upper bounds on the capacity coincide for the class of degraded noncausal relay channels and establish the capacity for this class.',

	{'abstract': u"Before we can get the whole potential of employing computers in the process of managing mathematical `knowledge', we have to convert informal knowledge into machine-oriented representations. How exactly to support this process so that it becomes as effortless as possible is one of the main unsolved problems of Mathematical Knowledge Management. Two independent projects in formalization of mathematical content showed that many of the time consuming tasks could be significantly reduced if adequate tool support were available. It was also established that similar tasks are typical for object oriented languages and that they are to a large extent solved by Integrated Development Environments (IDE). This thesis starts by analyzing the opportunities where formalization process can benefit from software support. A list of research questions is compiled along with a set of software requirements which are then used for developing a new IDE for the semantic TeX ( stex) format. The result of the current research is that, indeed, IDEs can be very useful in the process of formalization and presents a set of best practices for implementing such IDEs.",

	{'abstract': u'A new compression method called difference-Huffman coding (DHC) is introduced in this paper. It is verified empirically that DHC results in a smaller multidimensional physical representation than those for other previously published techniques (single count header compression, logical position compression, base-offset compression and difference sequence compression). The article examines how caching influences the expected retrieval time of the multidimensional and table representations of relations. A model is proposed for this, which is then verified with empirical data. Conclusions are drawn, based on the model and the experiment, about when one physical representation outperforms another in terms of retrieval time. Over the tested range of available memory, the performance for the multidimensional representation was always much quicker than for the table representation.',

We are especially focused on what the software developer context encompasses at the project level and how it can be captured.

	{'abstract': u'One utilisation of multidimensional databases is the field of On-line Analytical Processing (OLAP). The applications in this area are designed to make the analysis of shared multidimensional information fast [9]. On one hand, speed can be achieved by specially devised data structures and algorithms. On the other hand, the analytical process is cyclic. In other words, the user of the OLAP application runs his or her queries one after the other. The output of the last query may be there (at least partly) in one of the previous results. Therefore caching also plays an important role in the operation of these systems. However, caching itself may not be enough to ensure acceptable performance. Size does matter: The more memory is available, the more we gain by loading and keeping information in there. Oftentimes, the cache size is fixed. This limits the performance of the multidimensional database, as well, unless we compress the data in order to move a greater proportion of them into the memory. Caching combined with proper compression methods promise further performance improvements. In this paper, we investigate how caching influences the speed of OLAP systems. Different physical representations (multidimensional and table) are evaluated. For the thorough comparison, models are proposed. We draw conclusions based on these models, and the conclusions are verified with empirical data.',

	{'abstract': u'Although automatic techniques have been employed in manufacturing industries to increase productivity and efficiency, there are still lots of manual handling jobs, especially for assembly and maintenance jobs. In these jobs, musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) are one of the major health problems due to overload and cumulative physical fatigue. With combination of conventional posture analysis techniques, digital human modelling and simulation (DHM) techniques have been developed and commercialized to evaluate the potential physical exposures. However, those ergonomics analysis tools are mainly based on posture analysis techniques, and until now there is still no fatigue index available in the commercial software to evaluate the physical fatigue easily and quickly. In this paper, a new muscle fatigue and recovery model is proposed and extended to evaluate joint fatigue level in manual handling jobs. A special application case is described and analyzed by digital human simulation technique.',

	{'abstract': u'The Random Demodulator (RD) and the Modulated Wideband Converter (MWC) are two recently proposed compressed sensing (CS) techniques for the acquisition of continuous-time spectrally-sparse signals. They extend the standard CS paradigm from sampling discrete, finite dimensional signals to sampling continuous and possibly infinite dimensional ones, and thus establish the ability to capture these signals at sub-Nyquist sampling rates. The RD and the MWC have remarkably similar structures (similar block diagrams), but their reconstruction algorithms and signal models strongly differ. To date, few results exist that compare these systems, and owing to the potential impacts they could have on spectral estimation in applications like electromagnetic scanning and cognitive radio, we more fully investigate their relationship in this paper. We show that the RD and the MWC are both based on the general concept of random filtering, but employ significantly different sampling functions. We also investigate system sensitivities (or robustness) to sparse signal model assumptions. Lastly, we show that "block convolution" is a fundamental aspect of the MWC, allowing it to successfully sample and reconstruct block-sparse (multiband) signals. Based on this concept, we propose a new acquisition system for continuous-time signals whose amplitudes are block sparse. The paper includes detailed time and frequency domain analyses of the RD and the MWC that differ, sometimes substantially, from published results.',

	{'abstract': u'This paper analyzes the cache miss cost of algorithms when scheduled using randomized work stealing (RWS) in a parallel environment, taking into account the effects of false sharing. First, prior analyses (due to Acar et al.) are extended to incorporate false sharing. However, to control the possible delays due to false sharing, some restrictions on the algorithms seem necessary. Accordingly, the class of Hierarchical Tree algorithms is introduced and their performance analyzed. In addition, the paper analyzes the performance of a subclass of the Hierarchical Tree Algorithms, called HBP algorithms, when scheduled using RWS; improved complexity bounds are obtained for this subclass. This class was introduced in a companion paper with efficient resource oblivious computation in mind. Finally, we note that in a scenario in which there is no false sharing the results in this paper match prior bounds for cache misses but with reduced assumptions, and in particular with no need for a bounding concave function for the cost of cache misses as in prior work by Frigo and Strumpen. This allows non-trivial cache miss bounds in this case to be obtained for a larger class of algorithms.',

	{'abstract': u'In the literature, J.-P. Cheng et al. have proposed the MIMO-OFDM PHY integrated (MOPI) scheme for achieving physical-layer security in practice without using any cryptographic ciphers. The MOPI scheme uses channel sounding and physical-layer network coding (PNC) to prevent eavesdroppers from learning the channel state information (CSI). Nevertheless, due to the use of multiple antennas for PNC at transmitter and beamforming at receiver, it is not possible to have spatial multiplexing nor use space-time codes in our previous MOPI scheme. In this paper, we propose a variant of the MOPI scheme, called P-MOPI, that works with a cryptographic cipher and utilizes precoding matrix index (PMI) as an efficient key-exchange mechanism. With channel sounding, the PMI is only known between the transmitter and the legal receiver. The shared key can then be used, e.g., as the seed to generate pseudo random bit sequences for securing subsequent transmissions using a stream cipher. By applying the same techniques at independent subcarriers of the OFDM system, the P-MOPI scheme easily allows two communicating parties to exchange over 100 secret bits. As a result, not only secure communication but also the MIMO gain can be guaranteed by using the P-MOPI scheme.',

	{'abstract': u'We describe a framework to support the implementation of web-based systems intended to manipulate data stored in relational databases. Since the conceptual model of a relational database is often specified as an entity-relationship (ER) model, we propose to use the ER model to generate a complete implementation in the declarative programming language Curry. This implementation contains operations to create and manipulate entities of the data model, supports authentication, authorization, session handling, and the composition of individual operations to user processes. Furthermore, the implementation ensures the consistency of the database w.r.t. the data dependencies specified in the ER model, i.e., updates initiated by the user cannot lead to an inconsistent state of the database. In order to generate a high-level declarative implementation that can be easily adapted to individual customer requirements, the framework exploits previous works on declarative database programming and web user interface construction in Curry.',

	{'abstract': u'Voronoi diagrams appear in many areas in science and technology and have numerous applications. They have been the subject of extensive investigation during the last decades. Roughly speaking, they are a certain decomposition of a given space into cells, induced by a distance function and by a tuple of subsets called the generators or the sites. Consider the following question: does a small change of the sites, e.g., of their position or shape, yield a small change in the corresponding Voronoi cells? This question is by all means natural and fundamental, since in practice one approximates the sites either because of inexact information about them, because of inevitable numerical errors in their representation, for simplification purposes and so on, and it is important to know whether the resulting Voronoi cells approximate the real ones well. The traditional approach to Voronoi diagrams, and, in particular, to (variants of) this question, is combinatorial. However, it seems that there has been a very limited discussion in the geometric sense (the shape of the cells), mainly an intuitive one, without proofs, in Euclidean spaces. We formalize this question precisely, and then show that the answer is positive in the case of R^d, or, more generally, in (possibly infinite dimensional) uniformly convex normed spaces, assuming there is a common positive lower bound on the distance between the sites. Explicit bounds are given, and we allow infinitely many sites of a general form. The relevance of this result is illustrated using several pictures and many real-world and theoretical examples and counterexamples.',

It is particularly competitive for highly repetitive text collections such as sequence databases of genomes of related species, software repositories, versioned document collections, and temporal text databases. Such collections are extremely compressible but classical self-indexes fail to capture that source of compressibility. Our self-index takes in practice a few times the space of the text compressed with LZ77 (as little as 2.6 times), extracts 1--2 million characters of the text per second, and finds patterns at a rate of 10--50 microseconds per occurrence. It is smaller (up to one half) than the best current self-index for repetitive collections, and faster in many cases.',

First we define what we mean with "comparable results". From this we conclude, that the variance of the random variables shall grow proportionally to the sampling rate. Eventually we consider how noise behaves under common signal transformations, such as frequency filters, quantisation and impulse generation and we explore how these signal transformations must be designed in order generate sampling-rate-aware results when applied to white noise.',

	{'abstract': u'A number of data acquisition systems depend on human interface to access computer for measuring, processing and analyzing data and to prepare it for presentation and storage. Data acquisition software is installed on the computer and all intended operations are performed manually. The data acquisition software requires user intervention for operations like selection of measurement setup, acquisition and storage of data to computer. The duty of users becomes laborious if the data acquisition process lasts for a long duration and requires continuous repetition of steps. An appropriate solution to overcome such problem is to replace the physical operator with a virtual user. This software generated simulated user sits at the data acquisition process through out and automate all the intended steps of data acquisition. This paper presents a new approach for data acquisition by using keyboard emulation technique. A keyboard emulation software is developed which runs beside the main data acquisition software and acts as a virtual user. All the operations which require user interface are performed through fully automated computer program. The developed software/system is executed in a real time environment and the functionality of the software is verified. In the end, potential application areas of the designed keyboard emulation software are explored.',

	{'abstract': u'Most common public key cryptosystems and public key exchange protocols presently in use, such as the RSA algorithm, Diffie-Hellman, and elliptic curve methods are number theory based and hence depend on the structure of abelian groups. The strength of computing machinery has made these techniques theoretically susceptible to attack and hence recently there has been an active line of research to develop cryptosystems and key exchange protocols using noncommutative cryptographic platforms. This line of investigation has been given the broad title of noncommutative algebraic cryptography. This was initiated by two public key protocols that used the braid groups, one by Ko, Lee et.al.and one by Anshel, Anshel and Goldfeld. The study of these protocols and the group theory surrounding them has had a large effect on research in infinite group theory. In this paper we survey these noncommutative group based methods and discuss several ideas in abstract infinite group theory that have arisen from them. We then present a set of open problems.',

	{'abstract': u'The capacity of the Gaussian cognitive interference channel, a variation of the classical two-user interference channel where one of the transmitters (referred to as cognitive) has knowledge of both messages, is known in several parameter regimes but remains unknown in general. In this paper we provide a comparative overview of this channel model as we proceed through our contributions: we present a new outer bound based on the idea of a broadcast channel with degraded message sets, and another series of outer bounds obtained by transforming the cognitive channel into channels with known capacity. We specialize the largest known inner bound derived for the discrete memoryless channel to the Gaussian noise channel and present several simplified schemes evaluated for Gaussian inputs in closed form which we use to prove a number of results. These include a new set of capacity results for the a) "primary decodes cognitive" regime, a subset of the "strong interference" regime that is not included in the "very strong interference" regime for which capacity was known, and for the b) "S-channel" in which the primary transmitter does not interfere with the cognitive receiver. Next, for a general Gaussian cognitive interference channel, we determine the capacity to within one bit/s/Hz and to within a factor two regardless of channel parameters, thus establishing rate performance guarantees at high and low SNR, respectively. We also show how different simplified transmission schemes achieve a constant gap between inner and outer bound for specific channels. Finally, we numerically evaluate and compare the various simplified achievable rate regions and outer bounds in parameter regimes where capacity is unknown, leading to further insight on the capacity region of the Gaussian cognitive interference channel.',

We propose a coding strategy based on lattice coset encoding. We analyze Eve's probability of decoding, from which we define the secrecy gain as a design criterion for wiretap lattice codes, expressed in terms of the lattice theta series, which characterizes Eve's confusion as a function of the channel parameters. The secrecy gain is studied for even unimodular lattices, and an asymptotic analysis shows that it grows exponentially in the dimension of the lattice. Examples of wiretap lattice codes are given. Interestingly, minimizing Eve's probability of error involves the same optimization of the theta series as does the flatness factor, another newly defined code design that characterizes lattice codes that achieve strong secrecy.",

	{'abstract': u'We consider the question of the existence of variables with few occurrences in boolean conjunctive normal forms (clause-sets). Let mvd(F) for a clause-set F denote the minimal variable-degree, the minimum of the number of occurrences of variables. Our main result is an upper bound mvd(F) &lt;= nM(surp(F)) &lt;= surp(F) + 1 + log_2(surp(F)) for lean clause-sets F in dependency on the surplus surp(F). - Lean clause-sets, defined as having no non-trivial autarkies, generalise minimally unsatisfiable clause-sets. - For the surplus we have surp(F) &lt;= delta(F) = c(F) - n(F), using the deficiency delta(F) of clause-sets, the difference between the number of clauses and the number of variables. - nM(k) is the k-th "non-Mersenne" number, skipping in the sequence of natural numbers all numbers of the form 2^n - 1. We conjecture that this bound is nearly precise for minimally unsatisfiable clause-sets. As an application of the upper bound we obtain that (arbitrary!) clause-sets F with mvd(F) &gt; nM(surp(F)) must have a non-trivial autarky (so clauses can be removed satisfiability-equivalently by an assignment satisfying some clauses and not touching the other clauses). It is open whether such an autarky can be found in polynomial time. As a future application we discuss the classification of minimally unsatisfiable clause-sets depending on the deficiency.',

However, when designing a QoS solution, the estimation of the available resources still represents one of the main issues. This paper suggests an approach to estimate available resources on a node. This approach is based on the estimation of the busy ratio of the shared canal. We consider in our estimation the several constraints related to the Ad hoc transmission mode such as Interference phenomena. This approach is implemented on the AODV routing protocol.

	{'abstract': u'This paper presents an event-driven way finding algorithm for pedestrians in an evacuation scenario, which operates on a graph-based structure. The motivation of each pedestrian is to leave the facility. The events used to redirect pedestrians include the identification of a jam situation and/or identification of a better route than the current. This study considers two types of pedestrians: familiar and unfamiliar with the facility. Four strategies are modelled to cover those groups. The modelled strategies are the shortest path (local and global); They are combined with a quickest path approach, which is based on an observation principle. In the quickest path approach, pedestrians take their decisions based on the observed environment and are routed dynamically in the network using an appropriate cost benefit analysis function. The dynamic modelling of route choice with different strategies and types of pedestrians considers the manifold of in uences which appears in the real system and raises questions about the criticality of an evacuation process. To address this question criteria are elaborated. The criteria we focus on in this contribution are the evacuation time, the individual times spent in jam, the jam size evolution and the overall jam size itself. The in uences of the different strategies on those evaluation criteria are investigated. The sensibility of the system to disturbances (e.g. broken escape route) is also analysed.

	{'abstract': u'In a Role-Playing Game, finding optimal trajectories is one of the most important tasks. In fact, the strategy decision system becomes a key component of a game engine. Determining the way in which decisions are taken (online, batch or simulated) and the consumed resources in decision making (e.g. execution time, memory) will influence, in mayor degree, the game performance. When classical search algorithms such as A* can be used, they are the very first option. Nevertheless, such methods rely on precise and complete models of the search space, and there are many interesting scenarios where their application is not possible. Then, model free methods for sequential decision making under uncertainty are the best choice. In this paper, we propose a heuristic planning strategy to incorporate the ability of heuristic-search in path-finding into a Dyna agent. The proposed Dyna-H algorithm, as A* does, selects branches more likely to produce outcomes than other branches. Besides, it has the advantages of being a model-free online reinforcement learning algorithm. The proposal was evaluated against the one-step Q-Learning and Dyna-Q algorithms obtaining excellent experimental results: Dyna-H significantly overcomes both methods in all experiments. We suggest also, a functional analogy between the proposed sampling from worst trajectories heuristic and the role of dreams (e.g. nightmares) in human behavior.',

	{'abstract': u"We consider the design of efficient algorithms for a multicore computing environment with a global shared memory and p cores, each having a cache of size M, and with data organized in blocks of size B. We characterize the class of `Hierarchical Balanced Parallel (HBP)' multithreaded computations for multicores. HBP computations are similar to the hierarchical divide &amp; conquer algorithms considered in recent work, but have some additional features that guarantee good performance even when accounting for the cache misses due to false sharing. Most of our HBP algorithms are derived from known cache-oblivious algorithms with high parallelism, however we incorporate new techniques that reduce the effect of false-sharing. Our approach to addressing false sharing costs (or more generally, block misses) is to ensure that any task that can be stolen shares O(1) blocks with other tasks. We use a gapping technique for computations that have larger than O(1) block sharing. We also incorporate the property of limited access writes analyzed in a companion paper, and we bound the cost of accessing shared blocks on the execution stacks of tasks. We present the Priority Work Stealing (PWS) scheduler, and we establish that, given a sufficiently `tall' cache, PWS deterministically schedules several highly parallel HBP algorithms, including those for scans, matrix computations and FFT, with cache misses bounded by the sequential complexity, when accounting for both traditional cache misses and for false sharing. We also present a list ranking algorithm with almost optimal bounds. PWS schedules without using cache or block size information, and uses knowledge of processors only to the extent of determining the available locations from which tasks may be stolen; thus it schedules resource-obliviously.",

	{'abstract': u'Signal modeling lies at the core of numerous signal and image processing applications. A recent approach that has drawn considerable attention is sparse representation modeling, in which the signal is assumed to be generated as a combination of a few atoms from a given dictionary. In this work we consider a Bayesian setting and go beyond the classic assumption of independence between the atoms. The main goal of this paper is to introduce a statistical model that takes such dependencies into account and show how this model can be used for sparse signal recovery. We follow the suggestion of two recent works and assume that the sparsity pattern is modeled by a Boltzmann machine, a commonly used graphical model. For general dependency models, exact MAP and MMSE estimation of the sparse representation becomes computationally complex. To simplify the computations, we propose greedy approximations of the MAP and MMSE estimators. We then consider a special case in which exact MAP is feasible, by assuming that the dictionary is unitary and the dependency model corresponds to a certain sparse graph. Exploiting this structure, we develop an efficient message passing algorithm that recovers the underlying signal. When the model parameters defining the underlying graph are unknown, we suggest an algorithm that learns these parameters directly from the data, leading to an iterative scheme for adaptive sparse signal recovery. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated on real-life signals - patches of natural images - where we compare the denoising performance to that of previous recovery methods that do not exploit the statistical dependencies.',

	{'abstract': u'Network coding permits to deploy distributed packet delivery algorithms that locally adapt to the network availability in media streaming applications. However, it may also increase delay and computational complexity if it is not implemented efficiently. We address here the effective placement of nodes that implement randomized network coding in overlay networks, so that the goodput is kept high while the delay for decoding stays small in streaming applications. We first estimate the decoding delay at each client, which depends on the innovative rate in the network. This estimation permits to identify the nodes that have to perform coding for a reduced decoding delay. We then propose two iterative algorithms for selecting the nodes that should perform network coding. The first algorithm relies on the knowledge of the full network statistics. The second algorithm uses only local network statistics at each node. Simulation results show that large performance gains can be achieved with the selection of only a few network coding nodes. Moreover, the second algorithm performs very closely to the central estimation strategy, which demonstrates that the network coding nodes can be selected efficiently in a distributed manner. Our scheme shows large gains in terms of achieved throughput, delay and video quality in realistic overlay networks when compared to methods that employ traditional streaming strategies as well as random network nodes selection algorithms.',

	{'abstract': u'In this paper we present an approach to control a vehicle in a hostile environment with static obstacles and moving adversaries. The vehicle is required to satisfy a mission objective expressed as a temporal logic specification over a set of properties satisfied at regions of a partitioned environment. We model the movements of adversaries in between regions of the environment as Poisson processes. Furthermore, we assume that the time it takes for the vehicle to traverse in between two facets of each region is exponentially distributed, and we obtain the rate of this exponential distribution from a simulator of the environment. We capture the motion of the vehicle and the vehicle updates of adversaries distributions as a Markov Decision Process. Using tools in Probabilistic Computational Tree Logic, we find a control strategy for the vehicle that maximizes the probability of accomplishing the mission objective. We demonstrate our approach with illustrative case studies.',

	{'abstract': u"A directed acyclic graph (DAG) partially represents the conditional independence structure among observations of a system if the local Markov condition holds, that is, if every variable is independent of its non-descendants given its parents. In general, there is a whole class of DAGs that represents a given set of conditional independence relations. We are interested in properties of this class that can be derived from observations of a subsystem only. To this end, we prove an information theoretic inequality that allows for the inference of common ancestors of observed parts in any DAG representing some unknown larger system. More explicitly, we show that a large amount of dependence in terms of mutual information among the observations implies the existence of a common ancestor that distributes this information. Within the causal interpretation of DAGs our result can be seen as a quantitative extension of Reichenbach's Principle of Common Cause to more than two variables. Our conclusions are valid also for non-probabilistic observations such as binary strings, since we state the proof for an axiomatized notion of mutual information that includes the stochastic as well as the algorithmic version.",

	{'abstract': u'Random 3CNF formulas constitute an important distribution for measuring the average-case behavior of propositional proof systems. Lower bounds for random 3CNF refutations in many propositional proof systems are known. Most notably are the exponential-size resolution refutation lower bounds for random 3CNF formulas with clauses [Chvatal and Szemeredi (1988), Ben-Sasson and Wigderson (2001)]. On the other hand, the only known non-trivial upper bound on the size of random 3CNF refutations in a non-abstract propositional proof system is for resolution with clauses, shown by Beame et al. (2002). In this paper we show that already standard propositional proof systems, within the hierarchy of Frege proofs, admit short refutations for random 3CNF formulas, for sufficiently large clause-to-variable ratio. Specifically, we demonstrate polynomial-size propositional refutations whose lines are formulas (i.e., -Frege proofs) for random 3CNF formulas with variables and clauses. The idea is based on demonstrating efficient propositional correctness proofs of the random 3CNF unsatisfiability witnesses given by Feige, Kim and Ofek (2006). Since the soundness of these witnesses is verified using spectral techniques, we develop an appropriate way to reason about eigenvectors in propositional systems. To carry out the full argument we work inside weak formal systems of arithmetic and use a general translation scheme to propositional proofs.',

	{'abstract': u"For a software system, its architecture is typically defined as the fundamental organization of the system incorporated by its components, their relationships to one another and their environment, and the principles governing their design. If contributed to by the artifacts coresponding to engineering processes that govern the system's evolution, the definition gets natually extended into the architecture of software and software process. Obviously, as long as there were no software systems, managing their architecture was no problem at all; when there were only small systems, managing their architecture became a mild problem; and now we have gigantic software systems, and managing their architecture has become an equally gigantic problem (to paraphrase Edsger Dijkstra). In this paper we propose a simple, yet we believe effective, model for organizing architecture of software systems. First of all we postulate that only a hollistic approach that supports continuous integration and verification for all software and software process architectural artifacts is the one worth taking. Next we indicate a graph-based model that not only allows collecting and maintaining the architectural knowledge in respect to both software and software process, but allows to conveniently create various quantitive metric to asses their respective quality or maturity. Such model is actually independent of the development methodologies that are currently in-use, that is it could well be applied for projects managed in an adaptive, as well as in a formal approach. Eventually we argue that the model could actually be implemented by already existing tools, in particular graph databases are a convenient implementation of architectural repository.",

This analysis can extend to any range of time window lengths, following our earlier techniques. This relationship between repairman profit and speedup is applicable over a range of values that is dependent on the cost of putting the input in an especially desirable form, involving what are called "trimmed windows." For time windows with lengths between 1 and 2, the range of values for speedup for which our analysis holds is .

In this work, we analyze the network delay constrained throughput of a multiple input multiple output (MIMO) wireless channel with time-varying spatial correlation. The MIMO channel is modeled via its virtual representation, where the individual spatial paths between the antenna pairs are Gilbert-Elliot channels. The whole system is then described by a K-State Markov chain, where K depends upon the degree of freedom (DOF) of the channel. We prove that the DOF based modeling is indeed accurate. Furthermore, we study the impact of the delay requirements at the network layer, violation probability and the number of antennas on the throughput under different fading speeds and signal strength.',

	{'abstract': u'In this paper we consider a multiple access channel (MAC) with partial cribbing encoders. This means that each of two encoders obtains a deterministic function of the other encoder output with or without delay. The partial cribbing scheme is especially motivated by the additive noise Gaussian MAC since perfect cribbing results in the degenerated case of full cooperation between the encoders and requires an infinite entropy link. We derive a single letter characterization of the capacity of the MAC with partial cribbing for the cases of causal and strictly causal partial cribbing. Several numerical examples, such as quantized cribbing, are presented. We further consider and derive the capacity region where the cribbing depends on actions that are functions of the previous cribbed observations. In particular, we consider a scenario where the action is "to crib or not to crib" and show that a naive time-sharing strategy is not optimal.',

	{'abstract': u'A bio-inspired robust adaptive random search algorithm (BioRARSA), designed for distributed beamforming for sensor and relay networks, is proposed in this work. It has been shown via a systematic framework that BioRARSA converges in probability and its convergence time scales linearly with the number of distributed transmitters. More importantly, extensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed BioRARSA outperforms existing adaptive distributed beamforming schemes by as large as 29.8% on average. This increase in performance results from the fact that BioRARSA can adaptively adjust its sampling stepsize via the "swim" behavior inspired by the bacterial foraging mechanism. Hence, the convergence time of BioRARSA is insensitive to the initial sampling stepsize of the algorithm, which makes it robust against the dynamic nature of distributed wireless networks.',

	{'abstract': u'This paper focuses on dualizing tail-biting trellises, particularly KV-trellises. These trellises are based on characteristic generators, as introduced by Koetter/Vardy (2003), and may be regarded as a natural generalization of minimal conventional trellises, even though they are not necessarily minimal. Two dualization techniques will be investigated: the local dualization, introduced by Forney (2001) for general normal graphs, and a linear algebra based dualization tailored to the specific class of tail-biting BCJR-trellises, introduced by Nori/Shankar (2006). It turns out that, in general, the BCJR-dual is a subtrellis of the local dual, while for KV-trellises these two coincide. Furthermore, making use of both the BCJR-construction and the local dualization, it will be shown that for each complete set of characteristic generators of a code there exists a complete set of characteristic generators of the dual code such that their resulting KV-trellises are dual to each other if paired suitably. This proves a stronger version of a conjecture formulated by Koetter/Vardy.',

	{'abstract': u"The verification and validation of cyber-physical systems is known to be a difficult problem due to the different modeling abstractions used for control components and for software components. A recent trend to address this difficulty is to reduce the need for verification by adopting correct-by-design methodologies. According to the correct-by-design paradigm, one seeks to automatically synthesize a controller that can be refined into code and that enforces temporal specifications on the cyber-physical system. In this paper we consider an instance of this problem where the specifications are given by a fragment of Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) and the physical environment is described by a smooth differential equation. The contribution of this paper is to show that synthesis for cyber-physical systems is viable by considering a fragment of LTL that is expressive enough to describe interesting properties but simple enough to avoid Safra's construction. We report on two examples illustrating a preliminary implementation of these techniques on the tool PESSOALTL.",

	{'abstract': u'Novel large scale research projects often require cooperation between various different project partners that are spread among the entire world. They do not only need huge computing resources, but also a reliable network to operate on. The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN is a representative example for such a project. Its experiments result in a vast amount of data, which is interesting for researchers around the world. For transporting the data from CERN to 11 data processing and storage sites, an optical private network (OPN) has been constructed. As the experiment data is highly valuable, LHC defines very high requirements to the underlying network infrastructure. In order to fulfil those requirements, the connections have to be managed and monitored permanently. In this paper, we present the integrated monitoring solution developed for the LHCOPN. We first outline the requirements and show how they are met on the single network layers. After that, we describe, how those single measurements can be combined into an integrated view. We cover design concepts as well as tool implementation highlights.',

	{'abstract': u'It is well known that minimum received energy per bit in the interference channel is -1.59dB as if there were no interference. Thus, the best way to mitigate interference is to operate the interference channel in the low-SNR regime. However, when the SNR is small but non-zero, minimum energy per bit alone does not characterize performance. Verdu introduced the wideband slope S_0 to characterize the performance in this regime. We show that a wideband slope of S_0/S_=1/2 is achievable. This result is similar to recent results on degrees of freedom in the high SNR regime, and we use a type of interference alignment using delays to obtain the result. We also show that in many cases the wideband slope is upper bounded by S_0/S_&lt;=1/2 for large number of users K .',

	{'abstract': u'Outsourcing -- successful, and sometimes painful -- has become one of the hottest topics in IT service management discussions over the past decade. IT services are outsourced to external service provider in order to reduce the effort required for and overhead of delivering these services within the own organization. More recently also IT services providers themselves started to either outsource service parts or to deliver those services in a non-hierarchical cooperation with other providers. Splitting a service into several service parts is a non-trivial task as they have to be implemented, operated, and maintained by different providers. One key aspect of such inter-organizational cooperation is fault management, because it is crucial to locate and solve problems, which reduce the quality of service, quickly and reliably. In this article we present the results of a thorough use case based requirements analysis for an architecture for inter-organizational fault management (ioFMA). Furthermore, a concept of the organizational respective functional model of the ioFMA is given.',

Instead we consider Nash equilibria of the market viewed as a game, where players bid for items, and where the highest bidder on an item wins it and pays his bid. We first observe that pure Nash-equilibria of this game excatly correspond to price-based equilibiria (and thus need not exist), but that mixed-Nash equilibria always do exist, and we analyze their structure in several simple cases where no price-based equilibrium exists. We also undertake an analysis of the welfare properties of these equilibria showing that while pure equilibria are always perfectly efficient ("first welfare theorem"), mixed equilibria need not be, and we provide upper and lower bounds on their amount of inefficiency.',

	{'abstract': u'Multiple-input double-output (MIDO) codes are important in the near-future wireless communications, where the portable end-user device is physically small and will typically contain at most two receive antennas. Especially tempting is the 4 x 2 channel due to its immediate applicability in the digital video broadcasting (DVB). Such channels optimally employ rate-two space-time (ST) codes consisting of (4 x 4) matrices. Unfortunately, such codes are in general very complex to decode, hence setting forth a call for constructions with reduced complexity. Recently, some reduced complexity constructions have been proposed, but they have mainly been based on different ad hoc methods and have resulted in isolated examples rather than in a more general class of codes. In this paper, it will be shown that a family of division algebra based MIDO codes will always result in at least 37.5% worst-case complexity reduction, while maintaining full diversity and, for the first time, the non-vanishing determinant (NVD) property. The reduction follows from the fact that, similarly to the Alamouti code, the codes will be subsets of matrix rings of the Hamiltonian quaternions, hence allowing simplified decoding. At the moment, such reductions are among the best known for rate-two MIDO codes. Several explicit constructions are presented and shown to have excellent performance through computer simulations.',

	{'abstract': u'Ontologies and rules are usually loosely coupled in knowledge representation formalisms. In fact, ontologies use open-world reasoning while the leading semantics for rules use non-monotonic, closed-world reasoning. One exception is the tightly-coupled framework of Minimal Knowledge and Negation as Failure (MKNF), which allows statements about individuals to be jointly derived via entailment from an ontology and inferences from rules. Nonetheless, the practical usefulness of MKNF has not always been clear, although recent work has formalized a general resolution-based method for querying MKNF when rules are taken to have the well-founded semantics, and the ontology is modeled by a general oracle. That work leaves open what algorithms should be used to relate the entailments of the ontology and the inferences of rules. In this paper we provide such algorithms, and describe the implementation of a query-driven system, CDF-Rules, for hybrid knowledge bases combining both (non-monotonic) rules under the well-founded semantics and a (monotonic) ontology, represented by a CDF Type-1 (ALQ) theory.

	{'abstract': u'A privacy-preserving English auction protocol with round efficiency based on a modified ring signature has been proposed in this paper. The proposed protocol has three appealing characteristic: First, it offers conditional privacy-preservation: on the one hand, the bidder is anonymous to the public, on the other hand, only the collaboration of auctioneer and registration manager can reveal the true identity of a malicious bidder. Second, it does not require to maintain a black list which records the evicted malicious bidders. Finally, it is efficient: it saves the communication round complexity comparing with previously proposed solutions.',

	{'abstract': u'We submit newly developed citation impact indicators based not on arithmetic averages of citations but on percentile ranks. Citation distributions are-as a rule-highly skewed and should not be arithmetically averaged. With percentile ranks, the citation of each paper is rated in terms of its percentile in the citation distribution. The percentile ranks approach allows for the formulation of a more abstract indicator scheme that can be used to organize and/or schematize different impact indicators according to three degrees of freedom: the selection of the reference sets, the evaluation criteria, and the choice of whether or not to define the publication sets as independent. Bibliometric data of seven principal investigators (PIs) of the Academic Medical Center of the University of Amsterdam is used as an exemplary data set. We demonstrate that the proposed indicators [R(6), R(100), R(6,k), R(100,k)] are an improvement of averages-based indicators because one can account for the shape of the distributions of citations over papers.',

	{'abstract': u'In operational networks, nodes are connected via multiple links for load sharing and redundancy. This is done to make sure that a failure of a link does not disconnect or isolate some parts of the network. However, link failures have an effect on routing, as the routers find alternate paths for the traffic originally flowing through the link which has failed. This effect is severe in case of failure of a critical link in the network, such as backbone links or the links carrying higher traffic loads. When routing is done using the Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) routing protocol, the original weight selection for the normal state topology may not be as efficient for the failure state. In this paper, we investigate the single link failure issue with an objective to find a weight setting which results in efficient routing in normal and failure states. We engineer Tabu Search Iterative heuristic using two different implementation strategies to solve the OSPF weight setting problem for link failure scenarios. We evaluate these heuristics and show through experimental results that both heuristics efficiently handle weight setting for the failure state. A comparison of both strategies is also presented.',

	{'abstract': u'A coding scheme based on irregular low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes is proposed to send secret messages from a source over the Gaussian wiretap channel to a destination in the presence of a wiretapper, with the restriction that the source can send only binary phase-shift keyed (BPSK) symbols. The secrecy performance of the proposed coding scheme is measured by the secret message rate through the wiretap channel as well as the equivocation rate about the message at the wiretapper. A code search procedure is suggested to obtain irregular LDPC codes that achieve good secrecy performance in such context.',

	{'abstract': u'BitTorrent has recently introduced LEDBAT, a novel application-layer congestion control protocol for data exchange. The protocol design starts from the assumption that network bottlenecks are at the access of the network, and that thus user traffic competes creating self-inducing congestion. To relieve from this phenomenon, LEDBAT is designed to quickly infer that self-induced congestion is approaching (by detecting relative changes of the one-way delay in the transmission path), and to react by reducing the sending rate prior that congestion occurs. Prior work has however shown LEDBAT to be affected by a latecomer advantage, where newly arriving connections can starve already existing flows. In this work, we propose modifications to the congestion window update mechanism of the LEDBAT protocol that aim at solving this issue, guaranteeing thus intra-protocol fairness and efficiency. Closed-form expressions for the stationary throughput and queue occupancy are provided via a fluid model, whose accuracy is confirmed by means of ns2 packet level simulations. Our results show that the proposed change can effective solve the latecomer issue, without affecting the other original LEDBAT goals at the same time.',

	{'abstract': u'A fundamental problem in computational geometry is to compute an obstacle-avoiding Euclidean shortest path between two points in the plane. The case of this problem on polygonal obstacles is well studied. In this paper, we consider the problem version on curved obstacles, commonly modeled as splinegons. A splinegon can be viewed as replacing each edge of a polygon by a convex curved edge (polygons are special splinegons). Each curved edge is assumed to be of O(1) complexity. Given two points s and t and splinegons of totally vertices with pairwise disjoint interior, we compute a shortest s-to-t path avoiding the splinegons, in time, where k is a parameter sensitive to the structures of the input splinegons and is bounded by . In particular, when all splinegons are convex, is proportional to the number of common tangents in the free space (called "free common tangents") among the splinegons. Previous work is known only for some special cases of this problem (e.g., when the obstacles are discs or certain convex objects). Our algorithm improves several previous results. (1) We improve the previously best solution for computing a shortest path between two points among convex pseudodisks of O(1) complexity each. (2) We even improve an algorithm for the polygon case (when all splinegons are polygons). The polygon case has been solved in time, or in time. Thus, we improve the time result. (3) We give an optimal algorithm for a basic visibility problem of computing all free common tangents among pairwise disjoint convex splinegons of totally vertices, in time and O(n) space, where k is the number of all free common tangents (and ). Even for the special case when all splinegons are convex polygons, the previously best algorithm takes time.',

	{'abstract': u'In this paper we propose a vision system that performs image Super Resolution (SR) with selectivity. Conventional SR techniques, either by multi-image fusion or example-based construction, have failed to capitalize on the intrinsic structural and semantic context in the image, and performed "blind" resolution recovery to the entire image area. By comparison, we advocate example-based selective SR whereby selectivity is exemplified in three aspects: region selectivity (SR only at object regions), source selectivity (object SR with trained object dictionaries), and refinement selectivity (object boundaries refinement using matting). The proposed system takes over-segmented low-resolution images as inputs, assimilates recent learning techniques of sparse coding (SC) and grouped multi-task lasso (GMTL), and leads eventually to a framework for joint figure-ground separation and interest object SR. The efficiency of our framework is manifested in our experiments with subsets of the VOC2009 and MSRC datasets. We also demonstrate several interesting vision applications that can build on our system.',

	{'abstract': u'New technological developments have made it possible to interact with computer systems and applications anywhere and anytime. It is vital that these applications are able to adapt to the user, as a person, and to its current situation, whatever that is. Therefore, the premises for evolution towards a learning society and a knowledge economy are present. Hence, there is a stringent demand for new learner-centred frameworks that allow active participation of learners in knowledge creation within communities, organizations, territories and society, at large. This paper presents the multi-agent architecture of our context-aware system and the learning scenarios within ubiquitous learning environments that the system provides support for. This architecture is the outcome of our endeavour to develop ePH, a system for sharing public interest information and knowledge, which is accessible through always-on, context-aware services.',

	{'abstract': u"Our work is motivated by geographical forwarding of sporadic alarm packets to a base station in a wireless sensor network (WSN), where the nodes are sleep-wake cycling periodically and asynchronously. When a node (referred to as the source) gets a packet to forward, either by detecting an event or from an upstream node, it has to wait for its neighbors in a forwarding set (referred to as relays) to wake-up. Each of the relays is associated with a random reward (e.g., the progress made towards the sink) that is iid. To begin with, the source is uncertain about the number of relays, their wake-up times and the reward values, but knows their distributions. At each relay wake-up instant, when a relay reveals its reward value, the source's problem is to forward the packet or to wait for further relays to wake-up. In this setting, we seek to minimize the expected waiting time at the source subject to a lower bound on the average reward. In terms of the operations research literature, our work can be considered as a variant of the asset selling problem. We formulate the relay selection problem as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP), where the unknown state is the number of relays. We begin by considering the case where the source knows the number of relays. For the general case, where the source only knows a pmf on the number of relays, it has to maintain a posterior pmf on the number of relays and forward the packet iff the pmf is in an optimum stopping set. We show that the optimum stopping set is convex and obtain inner and outer bounds to this set. The computational complexity of the above policies motivates us to formulate an alternative simplified model, the optimal policy for which is a simple threshold rule. We provide simulation results to compare the performance of the various one-hop and end-to-end forwarding policies.",

	{'abstract': u'For the multiuser multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) downlink channel, the users feedback their channel state information (CSI) to help the base station (BS) schedule users and improve the system sum rate. However, this incurs a large aggregate feedback bandwidth which grows linearly with the number of users. In this paper, we propose a novel scheme to reduce the feedback load in a downlink orthogonal space division multiple access (SDMA) system with zero-forcing receivers by allowing the users to dynamically determine the number of feedback bits to use according to multiple decision thresholds. Through theoretical analysis, we show that, while keeping the aggregate feedback load of the entire system constant regardless of the number of users, the proposed scheme almost achieves the optimal asymptotic sum rate scaling with respect to the number of users (also known as the multiuser diversity). Specifically, given the number of thresholds, the proposed scheme can achieve a constant portion of the optimal sum rate achievable only by the system where all the users always feedback, and the remaining portion (referred to as the sum rate loss) decreases exponentially to zero as the number of thresholds increases. By deriving a tight upper bound for the sum rate loss, the minimum number of thresholds for a given tolerable sum rate loss is determined. In addition, a fast bit allocation method is discussed for the proposed scheme, and the simulation results show that the sum rate performances with the complex optimal bit allocation method and with the fast algorithm are almost the same. We compare our multi-threshold scheme to some previously proposed feedback schemes. Through simulation, we demonstrate that the proposed scheme can reduce the feedback load and utilize the limited feedback bandwidth more effectively than the existing feedback methods.',

	{'abstract': u'In Knowledge Management, variations in information expressions have proven a real challenge. In particular, classical semantic relations (e.g. synonymy) do not connect words with different parts-of-speech. The method proposed tries to address this issue. It consists in building a derivational resource from a morphological derivation tool together with derivational guidelines from a dictionary in order to store only correct derivatives. This resource, combined with a syntactic parser, a semantic disambiguator and some derivational patterns, helps to reformulate an original sentence while keeping the initial meaning in a convincing manner This approach has been evaluated in three different ways: the precision of the derivatives produced from a lemma; its ability to provide well-formed reformulations from an original sentence, preserving the initial meaning; its impact on the results coping with a real issue, ie a question answering task . The evaluation of this approach through a question answering system shows the pros and cons of this system, while foreshadowing some interesting future developments.',

	{'abstract': u'The spatial correlations in transmitter node locations introduced by common multiple access protocols makes the analysis of interference, outage, and other related metrics in a wireless network extremely difficult. Most works therefore assume that nodes are distributed either as a Poisson point process (PPP) or a grid, and utilize the independence properties of the PPP (or the regular structure of the grid) to analyze interference, outage and other metrics. But,the independence of node locations makes the PPP a dubious model for nontrivial MACs which intentionally introduce correlations, e.g. spatial separation, while the grid is too idealized to model real networks. In this paper, we introduce a new technique based on the factorial moment expansion of functionals of point processes to analyze functions of interference, in particular outage probability. We provide a Taylor-series type expansion of functions of interference, wherein increasing the number of terms in the series provides a better approximation at the cost of increased complexity of computation. Various examples illustrate how this new approach can be used to find outage probability in both Poisson and non-Poisson wireless networks.',

	{'abstract': u'We study the problem of estimating the average of a Lipschitz continuous function defined over a metric space, by querying at only a single point. More specifically, we explore the role of randomness in drawing this sample. Our goal is to find a distribution minimizing the expected estimation error against an adversarially chosen Lipschitz continuous function. Our work falls into the broad class of estimating aggregate statistics of a function from a small number of carefully chosen samples. The general problem has a wide range of practical applications in areas as diverse as sensor networks, social sciences and numerical analysis. However, traditional work in numerical analysis has focused on asymptotic bounds, whereas we are interested in the emph algorithm. For arbitrary discrete metric spaces of bounded doubling dimension, we obtain a PTAS for this problem. In the special case when the points lie on a line, the running time improves to an FPTAS. Both algorithms are based on approximately solving a linear program with an infinite set of constraints, by using an approximate separation oracle. For Lipschitz-continuous functions over , we calculate the precise achievable error as , which improves upon the quarter which is best possible for deterministic algorithms.',

	{'abstract': u'In this paper, we investigate two new candidate transmission schemes, Non-Orthogonal Frequency Reuse (NOFR) and Beam-Hoping (BH). They operate in different domains (frequency and time/space, respectively), and we want to know which domain shows overall best performance. We propose a novel formulation of the Signal-to-Interference plus Noise Ratio (SINR) which allows us to prove the frequency/time duality of these schemes. Further, we propose two novel capacity optimization approaches assuming per-beam SINR constraints in order to use the satellite resources (e.g. power and bandwidth) more efficiently. Moreover, we develop a general methodology to include technological constraints due to realistic implementations, and obtain the main factors that prevent the two technologies dual of each other in practice, and formulate the technological gap between them. The Shannon capacity (upper bound) and current state-of-the-art coding and modulations are analyzed in order to quantify the gap and to evaluate the performance of the two candidate schemes. Simulation results show significant improvements in terms of power gain, spectral efficiency and traffic matching ratio when comparing with conventional systems, which are designed based on uniform bandwidth and power allocation. The results also show that BH system turns out to show a less complex design and performs better than NOFR system specially for non-real time services.',

	{'abstract': u'The task of implementing a supervisory controller is non-trivial, even though different theories exist that allow automatic synthesis of these controllers in the form of automata. One of the reasons for this discord is due to the asynchronous interaction between a plant and its controller in implementations, whereas the existing supervisory control theories assume synchronous interaction. As a consequence the implementation suffer from the so-called inexact synchronisation problem. In this paper we address the issue of inexact synchronisation in a process algebraic setting, by solving a more general problem of refinement. We construct an asynchronous closed loop system by introducing a communication medium in a given synchronous closed loop system. Our goal is to find sufficient conditions under which a synchronous closed loop system is branching bisimilar to its corresponding asynchronous closed loop system.',

	{'abstract': u'In the past few years, the number of OLAP applications increased quickly. These applications use two significantly different DB structures: multidimensional (MD) and table-based. One can show that the traditional model of relational databases cannot make difference between these two structures. Another model is necessary to make the differences visible. One of these is the speed of the system. It can be proven that the multidimensional DB organization results in shorter response times. And it is crucial, since a manager may become impatient, if he or she has to wait say more than 20 seconds for the next screen. On the other hand, we have to pay for the speed with a bigger DB size. Why does the size of MD databases grow so quickly? The reason is the sparsity of data: The MD matrix contains many empty cells. Efficient handling of sparse matrices is indispensable in an OLAP application. One way to handle sparsity is to take the structure closer to the table-based one. Thus the DB size decreases, while the application gets slower. Therefore, other methods are needed. This paper deals with the comparison of the two DB structures and the limits of their usage. The new results of the paper: (1) It gives a constructive proof that all relations can be represented in MD arrays. (2) It also shows when the MD array representation is quicker than the table-based one. (3) The MD representation results in smaller DB size under some conditions. One such sufficient condition is proved in the paper. (4) A variation of the single count header compression scheme is described with an algorithm, which creates the compressed array from the ordered table without materializing the uncompressed array. (5) The speed of the two different database organizations is tested with experiments, as well. The tests are done on benchmark as well as real life data. The experiments support the theoretical results.',

	{'abstract': u'We present time-constrained automata (TCA), a model for hard real-time computation in which agents behaviors are modeled by automata and constrained by time intervals. TCA actions can have multiple start time and deadlines, can be aperiodic, and are selected dynamically following a graph, the time-constrained automaton. This allows expressing much more precise time constraints than classical periodic or sporadic model, while preserving the ease of scheduling and analysis. We provide some properties of this model as well as their scheduling semantics. We show that TCA can be automatically derived from source-code, and optimally scheduled on single processors using a variant of EDF. We explain how time constraints can be used to guarantee communication determinism by construction, and to study when possible agent interactions happen.',

	{'abstract': u'Approximating adequate number of clusters in multidimensional data is an open area of research, given a level of compromise made on the quality of acceptable results. The manuscript addresses the issue by formulating a transductive inductive learning algorithm which uses multivariate Chebyshev inequality. Considering clustering problem in imaging, theoretical proofs for a particular level of compromise are derived to show the convergence of the reconstruction error to a finite value with increasing (a) number of unseen examples and (b) the number of clusters, respectively. Upper bounds for these error rates are also proved. Non-parametric estimates of these error from a random sample of sequences empirically point to a stable number of clusters. Lastly, the generalization of algorithm can be applied to multidimensional data sets from different fields.',

	{'abstract': u'In an unreliable single-hop broadcast network setting, we investigate the throughput and decoding-delay performance of random linear network coding as a function of the coding window size and the network size. Our model consists of a source transmitting packets of a single flow to a set of users over independent erasure channels. The source performs random linear network coding (RLNC) over (coding window size) packets and broadcasts them to the users. We note that the broadcast throughput of RLNC must vanish with increasing , for any fixed Hence, in contrast to other works in the literature, we investigate how the coding window size must scale for increasing . Our analysis reveals that the coding window size of represents a phase transition rate, below which the throughput converges to zero, and above which it converges to the broadcast capacity. Further, we characterize the asymptotic distribution of decoding delay and provide approximate expressions for the mean and variance of decoding delay for the scaling regime of These asymptotic expressions reveal the impact of channel correlations on the throughput and delay performance of RLNC. We also show how our analysis can be extended to other rateless block coding schemes such as the LT codes. Finally, we comment on the extension of our results to the cases of dependent channels across users and asymmetric channel model.',

The course contains lectures and a set of special laboratory works. The laboratory works consist in designing and implementing a set of programs to solve multicriteria problems (ranking/selection, multiple choice problem, clustering, assignment). The programs above are used to solve some standard problems (e.g., hierarchical design of a student plan, design of a marketing strategy). Concurrently, each student can examine a unique applied problem from his/her applied domain(s) (e.g., telemetric system, GSM network, integrated security system, testing of microprocessor systems, wireless sensor, corporative communication network, network topology). Mainly, the course is targeted to developing the student skills in modular analysis and design of various multidisciplinary composite systems (e.g., software, electronic devices, information, computers, communications).

	{'abstract': u'Multiple-input, multiple-output (MIMO) technology provides high data rate and enhanced QoS for wireless com- munications. Since the benefits from MIMO result in a heavy computational load in detectors, the design of low-complexity sub-optimum receivers is currently an active area of research. Lattice-reduction-aided detection (LRAD) has been shown to be an effective low-complexity method with near-ML performance. In this paper we advocate the use of systolic array architectures for MIMO receivers, and in particular we exhibit one of them based on LRAD. The "LLL lattice reduction algorithm" and the ensuing linear detections or successive spatial-interference cancellations can be located in the same array, which is con- siderably hardware-efficient. Since the conventional form of the LLL algorithm is not immediately suitable for parallel processing, two modified LLL algorithms are considered here for the systolic array. LLL algorithm with full-size reduction (FSR-LLL) is one of the versions more suitable for parallel processing. Another variant is the all-swap lattice-reduction (ASLR) algorithm for complex-valued lattices, which processes all lattice basis vectors simultaneously within one iteration. Our novel systolic array can operate both algorithms with different external logic controls. In order to simplify the systolic array design, we replace the Lov \'asz condition in the definition of LLL-reduced lattice with the looser Siegel condition. Simulation results show that for LR- aided linear detections, the bit-error-rate performance is still maintained with this relaxation. Comparisons between the two algorithms in terms of bit-error-rate performance, and average FPGA processing time in the systolic array are made, which shows that ASLR is a better choice for a systolic architecture, especially for systems with a large number of antennas.',

The design solving process is based on Hierarchical Morphological Multicriteria Design (HMMD) approach: (1) design of a tree-like system model, (2) generation of design alternatives for leaf nodes of the system model, (3) Bottom-Up process: (i) multicriteria selection of design alternatives for system parts/components and (ii) composing the selected alternatives into a resultant combination (while taking into account ordinal quality of the alternatives above and their compatibility). A realistic numerical example illustrates the design process of a management system for smart homes.',

	{'abstract': u'We study the verification of a finite continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) C against a linear real-time specification given as a deterministic timed automaton (DTA) A with finite or Muller acceptance conditions. The central question that we address is: what is the probability of the set of paths of C that are accepted by A, i.e., the likelihood that C satisfies A? It is shown that under finite acceptance criteria this equals the reachability probability in a finite piecewise deterministic Markov process (PDP), whereas for Muller acceptance criteria it coincides with the reachability probability of terminal strongly connected components in such a PDP. Qualitative verification is shown to amount to a graph analysis of the PDP. Reachability probabilities in our PDPs are then characterized as the least solution of a system of Volterra integral equations of the second type and are shown to be approximated by the solution of a system of partial differential equations. For single-clock DTA, this integral equation system can be transformed into a system of linear equations where the coefficients are solutions of ordinary differential equations. As the coefficients are in fact transient probabilities in CTMCs, this result implies that standard algorithms for CTMC analysis suffice to verify single-clock DTA specifications.',

	{'abstract': u'We consider the use of aspect-oriented techniques as a flexible way to deal with security policies in distributed systems. Recent work suggests to use aspects for analysing the future behaviour of programs and to make access control decisions based on this; this gives the flavour of dealing with information flow rather than mere access control. We show in this paper that it is beneficial to augment this approach with history-based components as is the traditional approach in reference monitor-based approaches to mandatory access control. Our developments are performed in an aspect-oriented coordination language aiming to describe the Bell-LaPadula policy as elegantly as possible. Furthermore, the resulting language has the capability of combining both history- and future-sensitive policies, providing even more flexibility and power.',

Biological species are clusters of individuals defined by widely different criteria and in the biological perspective it is natural to (1) use different categorizations on the same entities (2) to compare the different categorizations and to analyze the dissimilarities, especially as they change over time. We employ the same methodology to comparisons of bibliometric classifications. We constructed them as analogs of three species concepts: cladistic or lineage based, similarity based, and "biological species" (based on co-reproductive ability). We use the Rand and Jaccard indexes to compare classifications in different time intervals. The experiment is aimed to address the classic problem of science mapping, as to what extent the various techniques based on different bibliometric indicators, such as citations, keywords or authors are able to detect convergent structures in the litrerature, that is, to identify coherent specialities or research directions and their dynamics.',

	{'abstract': u'In this paper, we study single cell multi-user downlink distributed antenna systems (DAS) where the antenna ports are geographically separated in a cell. First, we derive an expression of the ergodic sum rate for DAS in the presence of pathloss. Then, we propose a transmission selection scheme based on the derived expressions to maximize the overall ergodic sum rate. Utilizing the knowledge of distance information from a user to each distributed antenna (DA) port, we consider the pairings of each DA port and its supporting user to optimize the system performance. Then, we compute the ergodic sum rate for various transmission mode candidates and adopt a transmission selection scheme which chooses the best mode maximizing the ergodic sum rate among the mode candidates. In our proposed scheme, the number of mode candidates are greatly reduced compared to that of the ideal mode selection. Through Monte Carlo simulations, we will show the accuracy of our derivation for the ergodic sum rate expression. Moreover, simulation results with the pathloss modeling confirm that the proposed transmission selection scheme produces the average sum rate identical to the ideal mode selection with significantly reduced selection candidates.',

Our results encompass programs (processes containing neither free nor restricted session channels) and higher-order sessions (delegation).

	{'abstract': u'We consider the problem of interpolating an unknown multivariate polynomial with coefficients taken from a finite field or as numerical approximations of complex numbers. Building on the recent work of Garg and Schost, we improve on the best-known algorithm for interpolation over large finite fields by presenting a Las Vegas randomized algorithm that uses fewer black box evaluations. Using related techniques, we also address numerical interpolation of sparse polynomials with complex coefficients, and provide the first provably stable algorithm (in the sense of relative error) for this problem, at the cost of modestly more evaluations. A key new technique is a randomization which makes all coefficients of the unknown polynomial distinguishable, producing what we call a diverse polynomial. Another departure from most previous approaches is that our algorithms do not rely on root finding as a subroutine. We show how these improvements affect the practical performance with trial implementations.',

	{'abstract': u'The main objective of the paper is to improve the Round Robin (RR) algorithm using dynamic ITS by coalescing it with Shortest Remaining Time Next (SRTN) algorithm thus reducing the average waiting time, average turnaround time and the number of context switches. The original time slice has been calculated for each process based on its burst time.This is mostly suited for soft real time systems where meeting of deadlines is desirable to increase its performance. The advantage is that processes that are closer to their remaining completion time will get more chances to execute and leave the ready queue. This will reduce the number of processes in the ready queue by knocking out short jobs relatively faster in a hope to reduce the average waiting time, turn around time and number of context switches. This paper improves the algorithm [8] and the experimental analysis shows that the proposed algorithm performs better than algorithm [6] and [8] when the processes are having an increasing order, decreasing order and random order of burst time.',

Our one versus all query represents an efficient sequence database search program such as BLAST, which compares an input sequence to an entire data set. Given a natural assumption about the approximation stability of the emph objective function for clustering, we design a provably accurate clustering algorithm that uses few one versus all queries.

	{'abstract': u'Scheduling is the central concept used frequently in Operating System. It helps in choosing the processes for execution. Round Robin (RR) is one of the most widely used CPU scheduling algorithm. But, its performance degrades with respect to context switching, which is an overhead and it occurs during each scheduling. Overall performance of the system depends on choice of an optimal time quantum, so that context switching can be reduced. In this paper, we have proposed a new variant of RR scheduling algorithm, known as Dynamic Quantum with Readjusted Round Robin (DQRRR) algorithm. We have experimentally shown that performance of DQRRR is better than RR by reducing number of context switching, average waiting time and average turn around time.',

	{'abstract': u'We develop the pruned continuous Haar transform and the fast continuous Fourier series, two fast and efficient algorithms for rectilinear polygons. Rectilinear polygons are used in VLSI processes to describe design and mask layouts of integrated circuits. The Fourier representation is at the heart of many of these processes and the Haar transform is expected to play a major role in techniques envisioned to speed up VLSI design. To ensure correct printing of the constantly shrinking transistors and simultaneously handle their increasingly large number, ever more computationally intensive techniques are needed. Therefore, efficient algorithms for the Haar and Fourier transforms are vital. We derive the complexity of both algorithms and compare it to that of discrete transforms traditionally used in VLSI. We find a significant reduction in complexity when the number of vertices of the polygons is small, as is the case in VLSI layouts. This analysis is completed by an implementation and a benchmark of the continuous algorithms and their discrete counterpart. We show that on tested VLSI layouts the pruned continuous Haar transform is 5 to 25 times faster, while the fast continuous Fourier series is 1.5 to 3 times faster.',

	{'abstract': u"The paper describes a framework for multi-function system testing. Multi-function system testing is considered as fusion (or revelation) of clique-like structures. The following sets are considered: (i) subsystems (system parts or units / components / modules), (ii) system functions and a subset of system components for each system function, and (iii) function clusters (some groups of system functions which are used jointly). Test procedures (as units testing) are used for each subsystem. The procedures lead to an ordinal result (states, colors) for each component, e.g., [1,2,3,4] (where 1 corresponds to 'out of service', 2 corresponds to 'major faults', 3 corresponds to 'minor faults', 4 corresponds to 'trouble free service'). Thus, for each system function a graph over corresponding system components is examined while taking into account ordinal estimates/colors of the components. Further, an integrated graph (i.e., colored graph) for each function cluster is considered (this graph integrates the graphs for corresponding system functions). For the integrated graph (for each function cluster) structure revelation problems are under examination (revelation of some subgraphs which can lead to system faults): (1) revelation of clique and quasi-clique (by vertices at level 1, 2, etc.; by edges/interconnection existence) and (2) dynamical problems (when vertex colors are functions of time) are studied as well: existence of a time interval when clique or quasi-clique can exist. Numerical examples illustrate the approach and problems.",

The lack of a scalable matching algorithm operating on detailed execution paths motivates the search for an alternative solution. This paper proposes the use of word entropies for the classification of software traces. Using a well-studied defective software as an example, we investigate the application of both Shannon and extended entropies (Landsberg-Vedral, R 'nyi and Tsallis) to the classification of traces related to various software defects. Our study shows that using entropy measures for comparisons gives an efficient and scalable method for comparing traces. The three extended entropies, with parameters chosen to emphasize rare events, all perform similarly and are superior to the Shannon entropy.",

	{'abstract': u'This work considers coordination and bargaining between two selfish users over a Gaussian interference channel. The usual information theoretic approach assumes full cooperation among users for codebook and rate selection. In the scenario investigated here, each user is willing to coordinate its actions only when an incentive exists and benefits of cooperation are fairly allocated. The users are first allowed to negotiate for the use of a simple Han-Kobayashi type scheme with fixed power split. Conditions for which users have incentives to cooperate are identified. Then, two different approaches are used to solve the associated bargaining problem. First, the Nash Bargaining Solution (NBS) is used as a tool to get fair information rates and the operating point is obtained as a result of an optimization problem. Next, a dynamic alternating-offer bargaining game (AOBG) from bargaining theory is introduced to model the bargaining process and the rates resulting from negotiation are characterized. The relationship between the NBS and the equilibrium outcome of the AOBG is studied and factors that may affect the bargaining outcome are discussed. Finally, under certain high signal-to-noise ratio regimes, the bargaining problem for the generalized degrees of freedom is studied.',

The work is of interest in the case when low resolution A/D-converters (ADCs) have to be used to enable higher sampling rate and to simplify the hardware. An Expectation-Maximization (EM) based algorithm is proposed for solving this problem in a general setting. Besides, we derive the Cramer-Rao Bound (CRB) and discuss the effects of quantization and the optimal choice of the ADC characteristic. Numerical and analytical analysis reveals that reliable estimation may still be possible even when the quantization is very coarse.',

	{'abstract': u'In this paper, relaxed belief propagation (RBP) based detectors are proposed for multiple-input multiple-out (MIMO) system. The factor graph is leveraged to represent the MIMO channels, and based on which our algorithms are developed. Unlike the existing complicated standard belief propagation (SBP) detector that considers all the edges of the factor graph when updating messages, the proposed RBP focuses on partial edges, which largely reduces computational complexity. In particular, relax degree is introduced in to determine how many edges to be selected, whereby RBP is a generalized edge selection based BP method and SBP is a special case of RBP having the smallest relax degree. Moreover, we propose a novel Gaussian approximation with feedback information mechanism to enable the proposed RBP detector. In order to further improve the detection performance, we also propose to cascade a minimum mean square error (MMSE) detector before the RBP detector, from which pseudo priori information is judiciously exploited. Convergence and complexity analyses, along with the numerical simulation results, verify that the proposed RBP outperform other BP methods having the similar complexity, and the MMSE cascaded RBP even outperform SBP at the largest relax degree in large MIMO systems.',

	{'abstract': u'In multiple-antenna communications, as bandwidth and modulation order increase, system components must work with demanding tolerances. In particular, high resolution and high sampling rate analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) are often prohibitively challenging to design. Therefore ADCs for such applications should be low-resolution. This paper provides new insights into the problem of optimal signal detection based on quantized received signals for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channels. It capitalizes on previous works which extensively analyzed the unquantized linear vector channel using graphical inference methods. In particular, a "loopy" belief propagation-like (BP) MIMO detection algorithm, operating on quantized data with low complexity, is proposed. In addition, we study the impact of finite receiver resolution in fading channels in the large-system limit by means of a state evolution analysis of the BP algorithm, which refers to the limit where the number of transmit and receive antennas go to infinity with a fixed ratio. Simulations show that the theoretical findings might give accurate results even with moderate number of antennas.',

In our previous work, simulation-based controllability and simulation-based observability are proposed, under which the existence of bisimilarity supervisor is guaranteed. However, a given specification automaton may not satisfy these conditions, and a natural question is how to compute a maximum permissive subspecification. This paper aims to answer this question and investigate the computation of the supremal simulation-based controllable and strong observable subautomata with respect to given specifications by the lattice theory. In order to achieve the supremal solution, three monotone operators, namely simulation operator, controllable operator and strong observable operator, are proposed upon the established complete lattice. Then, inequalities based on these operators are formulated, whose solution is the simulation-based controllable and strong observable set. In particular, a su?cient condition is presented to guarantee the existence of the supremal simulation-based controllable and strong observable subautomata.

	{'abstract': u'In the recent world, security is a prime important issue, and encryption is one of the best alternative way to ensure security. More over, there are many image encryption schemes have been proposed, each one of them has its own strength and weakness. This paper presents a new algorithm for the image encryption/decryption scheme. This paper is devoted to provide a secured image encryption technique using multiple chaotic based circular mapping. In this paper, first, a pair of sub keys is given by using chaotic logistic maps. Second, the image is encrypted using logistic map sub key and in its transformation leads to diffusion process. Third, sub keys are generated by four different chaotic maps. Based on the initial conditions, each map may produce various random numbers from various orbits of the maps. Among those random numbers, a particular number and from a particular orbit are selected as a key for the encryption algorithm. Based on the key, a binary sequence is generated to control the encryption algorithm. The input image of 2-D is transformed into a 1- D array by using two different scanning pattern (raster and Zigzag) and then divided into various sub blocks. Then the position permutation and value permutation is applied to each binary matrix based on multiple chaos maps. Finally the receiver uses the same sub keys to decrypt the encrypted images. The salient features of the proposed image encryption method are loss-less, good peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), Symmetric key encryption, less cross correlation, very large number of secret keys, and key-dependent pixel value replacement.',

	{'abstract': u'We consider general multi-antenna fading channels with coarsely quantized outputs, where the channel is unknown to the transmitter and receiver. This analysis is of interest in the context of sensor network communication where low power and low cost are key requirements (e.g. standard IEEE 802.15.4 applications). This is also motivated by highly energy constrained communications devices where sampling the signal may be more energy consuming than processing or transmitting it. Therefore the analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) for such applications should be low-resolution, in order to reduce their cost and power consumption. In this paper, we consider the extreme case of only 1-bit ADC for each receive signal component. We derive asymptotics of the mutual information up to the second order in the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) under average and peak power constraints and study the impact of quantization. We show that up to second order in SNR, the mutual information of a system with two-level (sign) output signals incorporates only a power penalty factor of almost 1.96 dB compared to the system with infinite resolution for all channels of practical interest. This generalizes a recent result for the coherent case.',

	{'abstract': u'A number of methods have been proposed over the last decade for encoding information using deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), giving rise to the emerging area of DNA data embedding. Since a DNA sequence is conceptually equivalent to a sequence of quaternary symbols (bases), DNA data embedding (diversely called DNA watermarking or DNA steganography) can be seen as a digital communications problem where channel errors are tantamount to mutations of DNA bases. Depending on the use of coding or noncoding DNA hosts, which, respectively, denote DNA segments that can or cannot be translated into proteins, DNA data embedding is essentially a problem of communications with or without side information at the encoder. In this paper the Shannon capacity of DNA data embedding is obtained for the case in which DNA sequences are subject to substitution mutations modelled using the Kimura model from molecular evolution studies. Inferences are also drawn with respect to the biological implications of some of the results presented.',

	{'abstract': u'Distributed power control for parallel Gaussian interference channels recently draws great interests. However, all existing works only studied this problem under deterministic communication channels and required certain perfect information to carry out their proposed algorithms. In this paper, we study this problem for stochastic parallel Gaussian interference channels. In particular, we take into account the randomness of the communication environment and the estimation errors of the desired information, and thus formulate a stochastic noncooperative power control game. We then propose a stochastic distributed learning algorithm SDLA-I to help communication pairs learn the Nash equilibrium. A careful convergence analysis on SDLA-I is provided based on stochastic approximation theory and projected dynamic systems approach. We further propose another learning algorithm SDLA-II by including a simple iterate averaging idea into SDLA-I to improve algorithmic convergence performance. Numerical results are also presented to demonstrate the performance of our algorithms and theoretical results.',

	{'abstract': u'Many combinatorial problems arising in machine learning can be reduced to the problem of minimizing a submodular function. Submodular functions are a natural discrete analog of convex functions, and can be minimized in strongly polynomial time. Unfortunately, state-of-the-art algorithms for general submodular minimization are intractable for larger problems. In this paper, we introduce a novel subclass of submodular minimization problems that we call decomposable. Decomposable submodular functions are those that can be represented as sums of concave functions applied to modular functions. We develop an algorithm, SLG, that can efficiently minimize decomposable submodular functions with tens of thousands of variables. Our algorithm exploits recent results in smoothed convex minimization. We apply SLG to synthetic benchmarks and a joint classification-and-segmentation task, and show that it outperforms the state-of-the-art general purpose submodular minimization algorithms by several orders of magnitude.',

	{'abstract': u'Several mathematical ideas have been investigated for Quantitative Information Flow. Information theory, probability, guessability are the main ideas in most proposals. They aim to quantify how much information is leaked, how likely is to guess the secret and how long does it take to guess the secret respectively. In this paper, we show how the Lattice of Information provides a valuable foundation for all these approaches; not only it provides an elegant algebraic framework for the ideas, but also to investigate their relationship. In particular we will use this lattice to prove some results establishing order relation correspondences between the different quantitative approaches. The implications of these results w.r.t. recent work in the community is also investigated. While this work concentrates on the foundational importance of the Lattice of Information its practical relevance has been recently proven, notably with the quantitative analysis of Linux kernel vulnerabilities. Overall we believe these works set the case for establishing the Lattice of Information as one of the main reference structure for Quantitative Information Flow.',

	{'abstract': u'In many real-world scenarios, it is nearly impossible to collect explicit social network data. In such cases, whole networks must be inferred from underlying observations. Here, we formulate the problem of inferring latent social networks based on network diffusion or disease propagation data. We consider contagions propagating over the edges of an unobserved social network, where we only observe the times when nodes became infected, but not who infected them. Given such node infection times, we then identify the optimal network that best explains the observed data. We present a maximum likelihood approach based on convex programming with a l1-like penalty term that encourages sparsity. Experiments on real and synthetic data reveal that our method near-perfectly recovers the underlying network structure as well as the parameters of the contagion propagation model. Moreover, our approach scales well as it can infer optimal networks of thousands of nodes in a matter of minutes.',

	{'abstract': u'Next generation Internet is highly concerned about the issue of reliability. Principally, the foundation of reliability is authentication of the source IP address. With the signature-and-verification based defense mechanisms available today, unfortunately, there is a lack of hierarchical architecture, which makes the structure of the trust alliance excessively flat and single. Moreover, with the increasing scale of the trust alliance, costs of validation grow so quickly that they do not adapt to incremental deployment. Via comparison with traditional solutions, this article proposes a hierarchical, inter-domain authenticated source address validation solution named SafeZone. SafeZone employs two intelligent designs, lightweight tag replacement and a hierarchical partitioning scheme, each of which helps to ensure that SafeZone can construct trustworthy and hierarchical trust alliances without the negative influences and complex operations on de facto networks. Extensive experiments also indicate that SafeZone can effectively obtain the design goals of a hierarchical architecture, along with lightweight, loose coupling and "multi-fence support" and as well as an incremental deployment scheme.',

The input vector (x_1,...,x_n) is distributed among n&gt;=2 nodes, with x_i known to node i, where x_i is chosen from the set , for some integer M&gt;0. Instead of the "number on the forehand" model, we consider a point-to-point communication model (similar to the message passing model), which we believe is more realistic in networking settings. We assume a synchronous fully connected network of n nodes, the node IDs (identifiers) are common knowledge. We assume that all point-to-point communication channels/links are private such that when a node transmits, only the designated recipient can receive the message. The identity of the sender is known to the recipient. We demonstrate that traditional techniques generalized from two-party communication complexity problem are not sufficient to obtain tight bounds under the point-to-point communication model. We then introduce techniques which significantly reduce the space of protocols to study. These techniques are used to study some instances of the MEQ problem.',

	{'abstract': u'We consider the problem of cross-layer resource allocation in time-varying cellular wireless networks, and incorporate information theoretic secrecy as a Quality of Service constraint. Specifically, each node in the network injects two types of traffic, private and open, at rates chosen in order to maximize a global utility function, subject to network stability and secrecy constraints. The secrecy constraint enforces an arbitrarily low mutual information leakage from the source to every node in the network, except for the sink node. We first obtain the achievable rate region for the problem for single and multi-user systems assuming that the nodes have full CSI of their neighbors. Then, we provide a joint flow control, scheduling and private encoding scheme, which does not rely on the knowledge of the prior distribution of the gain of any channel. We prove that our scheme achieves a utility, arbitrarily close to the maximum achievable utility. Numerical experiments are performed to verify the analytical results, and to show the efficacy of the dynamic control algorithm.',

	{'abstract': u'In this paper the problem of scheduling with power control in wireless networks is studied: given a set of communication requests, one needs to assign the powers of the network nodes, and schedule the transmissions so that they can be done in a minimum time, taking into account the signal interference of concurrently transmitting nodes. The signal interference is modeled by SINR constraints. Approximation algorithms are given for this problem, which use the mean power assignment. The problem of schduling with fixed mean power assignment is also considered, and approximation guarantees are proven.',

	{'abstract': u'It is commonly accepted in the practice of on-line analytical processing of databases that the multidimensional database organization is less scalable than the relational one. It is easy to see that the size of the multidimensional organization may increase very quickly. For example, if we introduce one additional dimension, then the total number of possible cells will be at least doubled. However, this reasoning does not takethe fact into account that the multidimensional organization can be compressed. There are compression techniques, which can remove all or at least a part of the empty cells from the multidimensional organization, while maintaining a good retrieval performance. Relational databases often use B-tree indices to speed up the access to given rows of tables. It can be proven, under some reasonable assumptions, that the total size of the table and the B-tree index is bigger than a compressed multidimensional representation. This implies that the compressed array results in a smaller database and faster access at the same time. This paper compares several compression techniques and shows when we should and should not apply compressed arrays instead of relational tables.',

	{'abstract': u'In the theory of social choice the research is focused around the projection of individual preference orders to the social preference order. Also, the justification of the preference order formalism begins with the concept of utility i.e. an alternative is preferred to another one if the utility over the first is higher then the utility over the second. In this paper is proposed an ideal model of measuring utilities by considering individuals and alternatives no more as atomic concepts but as being composed by other entities. Furthermore is proposed a formal definition of evaluation processes based on utilities.',

	{'abstract': u'This paper focuses on the relation between computational learning theory and resource-bounded dimension. We intend to establish close connections between the learnability/nonlearnability of a concept class and its corresponding size in terms of effective dimension, which will allow the use of powerful dimension techniques in computational learning and viceversa, the import of learning results into complexity via dimension. Firstly, we obtain a tight result on the dimension of online mistake-bound learnable classes. Secondly, in relation with PAC learning, we show that the polynomial-space dimension of PAC learnable classes of concepts is zero. This provides a hypothesis on effective dimension that implies the inherent unpredictability of concept classes (the classes that verify this property are classes not efficiently PAC learnable using any hypothesis). Thirdly, in relation to space dimension of classes that are learnable by membership query algorithms, the main result proves that polynomial-space dimension of concept classes learnable by a membership-query algorithm is zero.',

	{'abstract': u'Human can be distinguished by different limb movements and unique ground reaction force. Cumulative foot pressure image is a 2-D cumulative ground reaction force during one gait cycle. Although it contains pressure spatial distribution information and pressure temporal distribution information, it suffers from several problems including different shoes and noise, when putting it into practice as a new biometric for pedestrian identification. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical translation-invariant representation for cumulative foot pressure images, inspired by the success of Convolutional deep belief network for digital classification. Key contribution in our approach is discriminative hierarchical sparse coding scheme which helps to learn useful discriminative high-level visual features. Based on the feature representation of cumulative foot pressure images, we develop a pedestrian recognition system which is invariant to three different shoes and slight local shape change.

	{'abstract': u'The PDPTW is an optimization vehicles routing problem which must meet requests for transport between suppliers and customers satisfying precedence, capacity and time constraints. We present, in this paper, a genetic algorithm for multi-objective optimization of a dynamic multi pickup and delivery problem with time windows (Dynamic m-PDPTW). We propose a brief literature review of the PDPTW, present our approach based on Pareto dominance method and lower bounds, to give a satisfying solution to the Dynamic m-PDPTW minimizing the compromise between total travel cost and total tardiness time. Computational results indicate that the proposed algorithm gives good results with a total tardiness equal to zero with a tolerable cost.',

	{'abstract': u'MDS array codes are widely used in storage systems to protect data against erasures. We address the emph problem, namely, in the case of erasures, what is the the fraction of the remaining information that needs to be accessed in order to rebuild emph the lost information? It is clear that when the number of erasures equals the maximum number of erasures that an MDS code can correct then the rebuilding ratio is 1 (access all the remaining information). However, the interesting (and more practical) case is when the number of erasures is smaller than the erasure correcting capability of the code. For example, consider an MDS code that can correct two erasures: What is the smallest amount of information that one needs to access in order to correct a single erasure? Previous work showed that the rebuilding ratio is bounded between 1/2 and 3/4, however, the exact value was left as an open problem. In this paper, we solve this open problem and prove that for the case of a single erasure with a 2-erasure correcting code, the rebuilding ratio is 1/2. In general, we construct a new family of -erasure correcting MDS array codes that has optimal rebuilding ratio of in the case of a single erasure. Our array codes have efficient encoding and decoding algorithms (for the case they use a finite field of size 3) and an optimal update property.',

	{'abstract': u'The efficient repair of cellular DNA is essential for the maintenance and inheritance of genomic information. In order to cope with the high frequency of spontaneous and induced DNA damage, a multitude of repair mechanisms have evolved. These are enabled by a wide range of protein factors specifically recognizing different types of lesions and finally restoring the normal DNA sequence. This work focuses on the repair factor XPC (xeroderma pigmentosum complementation group C), which identifies bulky DNA lesions and initiates their removal via the nucleotide excision repair pathway. The binding of XPC to damaged DNA can be visualized in living cells by following the accumulation of a fluorescent XPC fusion at lesions induced by laser microirradiation in a fluorescence microscope. In this work, an automated image processing pipeline is presented which allows to identify and quantify the accumulation reaction without any user interaction. The image processing pipeline comprises a preprocessing stage where the image stack data is filtered and the nucleus of interest is segmented. Afterwards, the images are registered to each other in order to account for movements of the cell, and then a bounding box enclosing the XPC-specific signal is automatically determined. Finally, the time-dependent relocation of XPC is evaluated by analyzing the intensity change within this box. Comparison of the automated processing results with the manual evaluation yields qualitatively similar results. However, the automated analysis provides more accurate, reproducible data with smaller standard errors. The image processing pipeline presented in this work allows for an efficient analysis of large amounts of experimental data with no user interaction required.',

	{'abstract': u'Traditional machine-learned ranking systems for web search are often trained to capture stationary relevance of documents to queries, which has limited ability to track non-stationary user intention in a timely manner. In recency search, for instance, the relevance of documents to a query on breaking news often changes significantly over time, requiring effective adaptation to user intention. In this paper, we focus on recency search and study a number of algorithms to improve ranking results by leveraging user click feedback. Our contributions are three-fold. First, we use real search sessions collected in a random exploration bucket for emph offline evaluation of these algorithms, which provides an unbiased comparison across algorithms without online bucket tests. Second, we propose a re-ranking approach to improve search results for recency queries using user clicks. Third, our empirical comparison of a dozen algorithms on real-life search data suggests importance of a few algorithmic choices in these applications, including generalization across different query-document pairs, specialization to popular queries, and real-time adaptation of user clicks.',

	{'abstract': u'A generalized criterion for signature related algorithms to compute Gr "obner basis is proposed in this paper. Signature related algorithms are a popular kind of algorithms for computing Gr "obner basis, including the famous F5 algorithm, the extended F5 algorithm and the GVW algorithm. The main purpose of current paper is to study in theory what kind of criteria is correct in signature related algorithms and provide a generalized method to develop new criteria. For this purpose, a generalized criterion is proposed. The generalized criterion only relies on a general partial order defined on a set of polynomials. When specializing the partial order to appropriate specific orders, the generalized criterion can specialize to almost all existing criteria of signature related algorithms. For partial orders, a complete proof of the correctness of the algorithm based on this generalized criterion is also presented. This proof has no extra requirements on the computing order of critical pairs, and is also valid for non-homogeneous polynomial systems. More importantly, the partial orders implied by existing criteria are admissible. Besides, one can also check whether a new criterion is correct in signature related algorithms or even develop new criteria by using other admissible partial orders in the generalized criterion.',

If no arc is contained in any other, then M is a proper Helly circular-arc model, if every arc has the same length, then M is a unit Helly circular-arc model, and if there are no two arcs covering the circle, then M is a normal Helly circular-arc model. A Helly (resp. proper Helly, unit Helly, normal Helly) circular-arc graph is the intersection graph of the arcs of a Helly (resp. proper Helly, unit Helly, normal Helly) circular-arc model. In this article we study these subclasses of Helly circular-arc graphs. We show natural generalizations of several properties of (proper) interval graphs that hold for some of these Helly circular-arc subclasses. Next, we describe characterizations for the subclasses of Helly circular-arc graphs, including forbidden induced subgraphs characterizations. These characterizations lead to efficient algorithms for recognizing graphs within these classes. Finally, we show how do these classes of graphs relate with straight and round digraphs.',

	{'abstract': u'This work introduces the IB-score, a family of independence-based score functions for robust learning of Markov networks independence structures. Markov networks are a widely used graphical representation of probability distributions, with many applications in several fields of science. The main advantage of the IB-score is the possibility of computing it without the need of estimation of the numerical parameters, an NP-hard problem, usually solved through an approximate, data-intensive, iterative optimization. We derive a formal expression for the IB-score from first principles, mainly maximum a posteriori and conditional independence properties, and exemplify several instantiations of it, resulting in two novel algorithms for structure learning: IBMAP-HC and IBMAP-TS. Experimental results over both artificial and real world data show these algorithms achieve important error reductions in the learnt structures when compared with the state-of-the-art independence-based structure learning algorithm GSMN, achieving increments of more than 50% in the amount of independencies they encode correctly, and in some cases, learning correctly over 90% of the edges that GSMN learnt incorrectly. Theoretical analysis shows IBMAP-HC proceeds efficiently, achieving these improvements in a time polynomial to the number of random variables in the domain.',

	{'abstract': u'Techniques for channel allocation in cellular networks have been an area of intense research interest for many years. An efficient channel allocation scheme can significantly reduce call-blocking and calldropping probabilities. Another important issue is to effectively manage the power requirements for communication. An efficient power control strategy leads to reduced power consumption and improved signal quality. In this paper, we present a novel integer linear program (ILP) formulation that jointly optimizes channel allocation and power control for incoming calls, based on the carrier-to-interference ratio (CIR). In our approach we use a hybrid channel assignment scheme, where an incoming call is admitted only if a suitable channel is found such that the CIR of all ongoing calls on that channel, as well as that of the new call, will be above a specified value. Our formulation also guarantees that the overall power requirement for the selected channel will be minimized as much as possible and that no ongoing calls will be dropped as a result of admitting the new call. We have run simulations on a benchmark 49 cell environment with 70 channels to investigate the effect of different parameters such as the desired CIR. The results indicate that our approach leads to significant improvements over existing techniques.',

	{'abstract': u'In this article we present the (CAL), a declarative language for describing properties of stateless program components that interact by exchanging messages. CAL allows one to describe functional as well as extra-functional behaviours, such as computation latency. The CAL language intention is to be able to describe the behaviour of so-called boxes in the context of S-Net. However, the language would find application in other coordination models based on stateless components.',

	{'abstract': u'The Dynamic Decode-and-Forward (DDF) protocol and the Hybrid DDF and Amplified-and-Forward (HDAF) protocol for the multiple-access relay channel (MARC) with quasi static fading are evaluated using the Zheng-Tse diversity-multiplexing tradeoff (DMT). We assume that there are two users, one half-duplex relay, and a common destination, each equipped with single antenna. For the Rayleigh fading, the DDF protocol is well known and has been analyzed in terms of the DMT with infinite block length. By carefully dealing with properties specific to finite block length, we characterize the finite block length DMT which takes into account the fact that the event of decoding error at the relay causes the degradation in error performance when the block length is finite. Furthermore, we consider the situation where the destination does not have a priori knowledge of the relay decision time at which the relay switches from listening to transmitting. By introducing a decision rejection criterion such that the relay forwards message only when its decision is reliable, and the generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT) at the destination that jointly decodes the relay decision time and the information message, our analysis show that the optimal DMT is achievable as if there is no decoding error at the relay and the relay decision time is known at the destination. Therefore, infinite block length and additional overhead for communicating the decision time are not needed for the DDF to achieve the optimal DMT. To further improve the DMT, we propose the HDAF protocol which take advantages of both the DDF and the Amplified-and-Forward protocols by judiciously choosing which protocol to use. Our result shows that the HDAF protocol outperforms the original DDF in the DMT perspective. Finally, a variant of the HDAF protocol with lower implementation complexity without sacrificing the DMT performance is devised.',

	{'abstract': u"For a binary system specified by the density operators r0 and r1 and by the prior probabilities q0 and q1, Helstrom's theory permits the evaluation of the optimal measurement operators and of the corresponding maximum correct detection probability. The theory is based on the eigendecomposition (EID) of the operator, given by the difference of the weighted density operators, namely D = q1r1-q0r0. In general, this EID is obtained explicitly only with pure states, whereas with mixed states it must be carried out numerically. In this letter we show that the same evaluation can be performed on the basis of a modified version of the Gram matrix. The advantage is due to the fact that the outer products of density operators are replaced by inner product, with a considerable dimensionality reduction. At the limit, in quantum optical communications the density operators have infinite dimensions, whereas the inner products are simply scalar quantities. The Gram matrix approach permits the explicit (not numerical) evaluation of a binary system performance in cases not previously developed.",

	{'abstract': u'The past decade has seen the growing popularity of Bag of Features (BoF) approaches to many computer vision tasks, including image classification, video search, robot localization, and texture recognition. Part of the appeal is simplicity. BoF methods are based on orderless collections of quantized local image descriptors; they discard spatial information and are therefore conceptually and computationally simpler than many alternative methods. Despite this, or perhaps because of this, BoF-based systems have set new performance standards on popular image classification benchmarks and have achieved scalability breakthroughs in image retrieval. This paper presents an introduction to BoF image representations, describes critical design choices, and surveys the BoF literature. Emphasis is placed on recent techniques that mitigate quantization errors, improve feature detection, and speed up image retrieval. At the same time, unresolved issues and fundamental challenges are raised. Among the unresolved issues are determining the best techniques for sampling images, describing local image features, and evaluating system performance. Among the more fundamental challenges are how and whether BoF methods can contribute to localizing objects in complex images, or to associating high-level semantics with natural images. This survey should be useful both for introducing new investigators to the field and for providing existing researchers with a consolidated reference to related work.',

	{'abstract': u'Compressive sensing (CS) is a sampling technique designed for reducing the complexity of sparse data acquisition. One of the major obstacles for practical deployment of CS techniques is the signal reconstruction time and the high storage cost of random sensing matrices. We propose a new structured compressive sensing scheme, based on codes of graphs, that allows for a joint design of structured sensing matrices and logarithmic-complexity reconstruction algorithms. The compressive sensing matrices can be shown to offer asymptotically optimal performance when used in combination with Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP) methods. For more elaborate greedy reconstruction schemes, we propose a new family of list decoding belief propagation algorithms, as well as reinforced- and multiple-basis belief propagation algorithms. Our simulation results indicate that reinforced BP CS schemes offer very good complexity-performance tradeoffs for very sparse signal vectors.',

	{'abstract': u'Recently, several researchers have found that cost-based satisficing search with A* often runs into problems. Although some "work arounds" have been proposed to ameliorate the problem, there has not been any concerted effort to pinpoint its origin. In this paper, we argue that the origins can be traced back to the wide variance in action costs that is observed in most planning domains. We show that such cost variance misleads A* search, and that this is no trifling detail or accidental phenomenon, but a systemic weakness of the very concept of "cost-based evaluation functions + systematic search + combinatorial graphs". We show that satisficing search with sized-based evaluation functions is largely immune to this problem.',

The aim of community detection is to identify sets of nodes in a network which are more interconnected relative to their connectivity to the rest of the network. A large number of algorithms have been developed to tackle this problem, but as with any machine learning task there is no "one-size-fits-all" and each algorithm excels in a specific part of the problem space. This paper examines the performance of algorithms developed for weighted networks against those using unweighted networks for different parts of the problem space (parameterised by the intra/inter community links). It is then demonstrated how the choice of algorithm (weighted/unweighted) can be made based only on the observed network.',

	{'abstract': u"This chapter is concerned with the design and analysis of algorithms for minimizing finite automata. Getting a minimal automaton is a fundamental issue in the use and implementation of finite automata tools in frameworks like text processing, image analysis, linguistic computer science, and many other applications. There are two main families of minimization algorithms. The first by a sequence of refinements of a partition of the set of states, the second by a sequence of fusions or merges of states. Hopcroft's and Moore's algorithms belong to the first family, the linear-time minimization of acyclic automata of Revuz belongs to the second family. One of our studies is upon the comparison of the nature of Moore's and Hopcroft's algorithms. This gives some new insight in both algorithms. As we shall see, these algorithms are quite different both in behavior and in complexity. In particular, we show that it is not possible to simulate the computations of one of the algorithm by the other. We describe the minimization algorithm by fusion for so-called local automata. A special case of minimization is the construction o minimal automata for finite sets. We consider briefly this case, and in particular describe incremental algorithms. Finally, we consider the case of updating a minimal automaton when a word is added or removed from the set it recognizes.",

	{'abstract': u"For a polygon P with n vertices, the vertex guarding problem asks for the minimum subset G of P's vertices such that every point in P is seen by at least one point in G. This problem is NP-complete and APX-hard. The first approximation algorithm (Ghosh, 1987) involves decomposing P into O(n^4) cells that are equivalence classes for visibility from the vertices of P. This discretized problem can then be treated as an instance of set cover and solved in O(n^5) time with a greedy O(log n)-approximation algorithm. Ghosh (2010) recently revisited the algorithm, noting that minimum visibility decompositions for simple polygons (Bose et al., 2000) have only O(n^3) cells, improving the running time of the algorithm to O(n^4) for simple polygons. In this paper we show that, since minimum visibility decompositions for simple polygons have only O(n^2) cells of minimal visibility (Bose et al., 2000), the running time of the algorithm can be further improved to O(n^3). This result was obtained independently by Jang and Kwon (2011). We extend the result of Bose et al. to polygons with holes, showing that a minimum visibility decomposition of a polygon with h holes has only O((h+1)n^3) cells and only O((h+1)^2 n^2) cells of minimal visibility. We exploit this result to obtain a faster algorithm for vertex guarding polygons with holes. We then show that, in the same time complexity, we can attain approximation factors of O(log log(opt)) for simple polygons and O((1+ log((h+1))) log(opt)) for polygons with holes.",

	{'abstract': u'We show that the performance of relay selection can be improved by employing relays with buffers. Under the idealized assumption that no buffer is full or empty, the best source-relay and the best relay-destination channels can be simultaneously exploited by selecting the corresponding relays for reception and transmission, respectively. The resulting relay selection scheme is referred to as max-max relay selection (MMRS). Since for finite buffer sizes, empty and full buffers are practically unavoidable if MMRS is employed, we propose a hybrid relay selection (HRS) scheme, which is a combination of conventional best relay selection (BRS) and MMRS. We analyze the outage probabilities of MMRS and HRS and show that both schemes achieve the same diversity gain as conventional BRS and a superior coding gain. Furthermore, our results show that for moderate buffer sizes (e.g. 30 packets) HRS closely approaches the performance of idealized MMRS and the performance gain compared to BRS approaches 3 dB as the number of relays increases.',

	{'abstract': u'When dealing with large graphs, such as those that arise in the context of online social networks, a subset of nodes may be labeled. These labels can indicate demographic values, interest, beliefs or other characteristics of the nodes (users). A core problem is to use this information to extend the labeling so that all nodes are assigned a label (or labels). In this chapter, we survey classification techniques that have been proposed for this problem. We consider two broad categories: methods based on iterative application of traditional classifiers using graph information as features, and methods which propagate the existing labels via random walks. We adopt a common perspective on these methods to highlight the similarities between different approaches within and across the two categories. We also describe some extensions and related directions to the central problem of node classification.',

	{'abstract': u"Despite of being quite similar agreement problems, consensus and general k-set agreement require surprisingly different techniques for proving the impossibility in asynchronous systems with crash failures: Rather than relatively simple bivalence arguments as in the impossibility proof for consensus (= 1-set agreement) in the presence of a single crash failure, known proofs for the impossibility of k-set agreement in systems with at least k&gt;1 crash failures use algebraic topology or a variant of Sperner's Lemma. In this paper, we present a generic theorem for proving the impossibility of k-set agreement in various message passing settings, which is based on a simple reduction to the consensus impossibility in a certain subsystem. We demonstrate the broad applicability of our result by exploring the possibility/impossibility border of k-set agreement in several message-passing system models: (i) asynchronous systems with crash failures, (ii) partially synchronous processes with (initial) crash failures, and (iii) asynchronous systems augmented with failure detectors. In (i) and (ii), the impossibility part is just an instantiation of our main theorem, whereas the possibility of achieving k-set agreement in (ii) follows by generalizing the consensus algorithm for initial crashes by Fisher, Lynch and Patterson. In (iii), applying our technique yields the exact border for the parameter k where k-set agreement is solvable with the failure detector class (Sigma_k,Omega_k), for (1&lt;= k&lt;= n-1), of Bonnet and Raynal. Considering that Sigma_k was shown to be necessary for solving k-set agreement, this result yields new insights on the quest for the weakest failure detector.",

Our main aim is to characterize the feasibility of achieving this for different values of n and [k_1 ... k_n]. For 3 unicast connections (n = 3), we characterize several achievable and unachievable values of the connectivity 3-tuple. In addition, in this work, we have found certain network topologies, and capacity characterizations that are useful in understanding the case of general n.',

	{'abstract': u'The ongoing globalisation of science has undisputedly a major impact on how and where scientific research is being conducted nowadays. Yet, the big picture remains blurred. It is largely unknown where this process is heading, and at which rate. Which countries are leading or lagging? Many of its key features are difficult if not impossible to capture in measurements and comparative statistics. Our empirical study measures the extent and growth of scientific globalisation in terms of physical distances between co-authoring researchers. Our analysis, drawing on 21 million research publications across all countries and fields of science, reveals that contemporary science has globalised at a fairly steady rate during recent decades. The average collaboration distance per publication has increased from 334 kilometres in 1980 to 1553 in 2009. Despite significant differences in globalisation rates across countries and fields of science, we observe a pervasive process in motion, moving towards a truly interconnected global science system.',

	{'abstract': u'The framework of psi-calculi extends the pi-calculus with nominal datatypes for data structures and for logical assertions and conditions. These can be transmitted between processes and their names can be statically scoped as in the standard pi-calculus. Psi-calculi can capture the same phenomena as other proposed extensions of the pi-calculus such as the applied pi-calculus, the spi-calculus, the fusion calculus, the concurrent constraint pi-calculus, and calculi with polyadic communication channels or pattern matching. Psi-calculi can be even more general, for example by allowing structured channels, higher-order formalisms such as the lambda calculus for data structures, and predicate logic for assertions. We provide ample comparisons to related calculi and discuss a few significant applications. Our labelled operational semantics and definition of bisimulation is straightforward, without a structural congruence. We establish minimal requirements on the nominal data and logic in order to prove general algebraic properties of psi-calculi, all of which have been checked in the interactive theorem prover Isabelle. Expressiveness of psi-calculi significantly exceeds that of other formalisms, while the purity of the semantics is on par with the original pi-calculus.',

	{'abstract': u'It has been widely observed that there exists a fundamental trade-off between the minimum (Hamming) distance properties and the iterative decoding convergence behavior of turbo-like codes. While capacity achieving code ensembles typically are asymptotically bad in the sense that their minimum distance does not grow linearly with block length, and they therefore exhibit an error floor at moderate-to-high signal to noise ratios, asymptotically good codes usually converge further away from channel capacity. In this paper, we introduce the concept of tuned turbo codes, a family of asymptotically good hybrid concatenated code ensembles, where asymptotic minimum distance growth rates, convergence thresholds, and code rates can be traded-off using two tuning parameters, and . By decreasing , the asymptotic minimum distance growth rate is reduced in exchange for improved iterative decoding convergence behavior, while increasing raises the asymptotic minimum distance growth rate at the expense of worse convergence behavior, and thus the code performance can be tuned to fit the desired application. By decreasing , a similar tuning behavior can be achieved for higher rate code ensembles.',

To this end, we first discuss ideal noncoherent sequence estimation and approximations thereof based on block-wise multiple-symbol differential detection (MSDD) and the Viterbi algorithm (VA) from the perspective of tree-search/trellis decoding. Exploiting relations well-known from tree-search decoding, we are able to derive the novel decision-feedback differential detection (DF-DD) schemes. A comprehensive comparison with respect to performance and complexity of the presented schemes in a typical IR-UWB scenario reveals---along with novel insights in techniques for complexity reduction of the sphere decoder applied for MSDD---that sorted DF-DD achieves close-to-optimum performance at very low, and in particular constant receiver complexity.',

	{'abstract': u"Energy consumption of a wireless sensor node mainly depends on the amount of time the node spends in each of the high power active (e.g., transmit, receive) and low power sleep modes. It has been well established that in order to prolong node's lifetime the duty-cycle of the node should be low. However, low power sleep modes usually have low current draw but high energy cost while switching to the active mode with a higher current draw. In this work, we investigate a MaxWeightlike opportunistic sleep-active scheduling algorithm that takes into account time- varying channel and traffic conditions. We show that our algorithm is energy optimal in the sense that the proposed ESS algorithm can achieve an energy consumption which is arbitrarily close to the global minimum solution. Simulation studies are provided to confirm the theoretical results.",

	{'abstract': u'The context of this work is the design of a software, called MEMSALab, dedicated to the automatic derivation of multiscale models of arrays of micro- and nanosystems. In this domain a model is a partial differential equation. Multiscale methods approximate it by another partial differential equation which can be numerically simulated in a reasonable time. The challenge consists in taking into account a wide range of geometries combining thin and periodic structures with the possibility of multiple nested scales. In this paper we present a transformation language that will make the development of MEMSALab more feasible. It is proposed as a Maple package for rule-based programming, rewriting strategies and their combination with standard Maple code. We illustrate the practical interest of this language by using it to encode two examples of multiscale derivations, namely the two-scale limit of the derivative operator and the two-scale model of the stationary heat equation.',

	{'abstract': u'Cut-set bounds on achievable rates for network communication protocols are not in general tight. In this paper we introduce a new technique for proving converses for the problem of transmission of correlated sources in networks, that results in bounds that are tighter than the corresponding cut-set bounds. We also define the concept of "uncertainty region" which might be of independent interest. We provide a full characterization of this region for the case of two correlated random variables. The bounding technique works as follows: on one hand we show that if the communication problem is solvable, the uncertainty of certain random variables in the network with respect to imaginary parties that have partial knowledge of the sources must satisfy some constraints that depend on the network architecture. On the other hand, the same uncertainties have to satisfy constraints that only depend on the joint distribution of the sources. Matching these two leads to restrictions on the statistical joint distribution of the sources in communication problems that are solvable over a given network architecture.',

	{'abstract': u"In a multi-hop mobile ad hoc network (MANET) mobile nodes communicate with each other forming a cooperative radio network. Security remains a major challenge for these networks due to their features of open medium, dynamically changing topologies, reliance on cooperative algorithms, absence of centralized monitoring points, and lack of any clear lines of defense. Most of the currently existing security algorithms designed for these networks are insecure, in efficient, and have low detection accuracy for nodes' misbehaviour. In this paper, a new approach has been proposed to bring out the complementary relationship between key distribution and misbehaviour detection for developing an integrated security solution for MANETs. The redundancy of routing information in ad hoc networks is utilized to develop a highly reliable protocol that works even in presence of transient network partitioning and Byzantine failure of nodes. The proposed mechanism is fully co-operative, and thus it is more robust as the vulnerabilities of the election algorithms used for choosing the subset of nodes for cooperation are absent. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed protocol.",

	{'abstract': u'We present an incremental, scalable and efficient dimension reduction technique for tensors that is based on sparse random linear coding. Data is stored in a compactified representation with fixed size, which makes memory requirements low and predictable. Component encoding and decoding are performed on-line without computationally expensive re-analysis of the data set. The range of tensor indices can be extended dynamically without modifying the component representation. This idea originates from a mathematical model of semantic memory and a method known as random indexing in natural language processing. We generalize the random-indexing algorithm to tensors and present signal-to-noise-ratio simulations for representations of vectors and matrices. We present also a mathematical analysis of the approximate orthogonality of high-dimensional ternary vectors, which is a property that underpins this and other similar random-coding approaches to dimension reduction. To further demonstrate the properties of random indexing we present results of a synonym identification task. The method presented here has some similarities with random projection and Tucker decomposition, but it performs well at high dimensionality only (n&gt;10^3). Random indexing is useful for a range of complex practical problems, e.g., in natural language processing, data mining, pattern recognition, event detection, graph searching and search engines. Prototype software is provided. It supports encoding and decoding of tensors of order &gt;= 1 in a unified framework, i.e., vectors, matrices and higher order tensors.',

	{'abstract': u"We apply large deviations theory to study asymptotic performance of running consensus distributed detection in sensor networks. Running consensus is a stochastic approximation type algorithm, recently proposed. At each time step k, the state at each sensor is updated by a local averaging of the sensor's own state and the states of its neighbors (consensus) and by accounting for the new observations (innovation). We assume Gaussian, spatially correlated observations. We allow the underlying network be time varying, provided that the graph that collects the union of links that are online at least once over a finite time window is connected. This paper shows through large deviations that, under stated assumptions on the network connectivity and sensors' observations, the running consensus detection asymptotically approaches in performance the optimal centralized detection. That is, the Bayes probability of detection error (with the running consensus detector) decays exponentially to zero as k goes to infinity at the Chernoff information rate-the best achievable rate of the asymptotically optimal centralized detector.",

	{'abstract': u'A restricted two-way communication problem in a small fully-connected network is investigated. The network consists of three nodes, all having access to a common channel with half-duplex constraint. Two nodes want to establish a dialog while the third node can assist in the bi-directional transmission process. All nodes have agreed on a transmission protocol a priori and the problem is restricted to the dialog encoders not being allowed to establish a cooperation by the use of previous receive signals. The channel is referred to as the restricted half-duplex two-way relay channel. Here the channel is defined and an outer bound on the achievable rates is derived by the application of the cut-set theorem. This shows that the problem consists of six parts. We propose a transmission protocol which takes into account all possible transmit-receive configurations of the network and performs partial decoding of the messages at the relay as well as sequential decoding at the dialog nodes. By the use of random codes and suboptimal decoders, two inner bound on the achievable rates are derived. Restricting to the suggested strategies and fixed input distributions it is argued to be possible to determine optimal transmission schemes with respect to various reasonable objectives at low complexity. In comparison to two-way communication without relay, simulations for an AWGN channel model then show that it is possible to simultaneously increase the communication rates of both dialog messages and to outperform relaying strategies that ignore an available direct path.',

	{'abstract': u'We consider the estimation of an i.i.d. random vector observed through a linear transform followed by a componentwise, probabilistic (possibly nonlinear) measurement channel. A novel algorithm, called generalized approximate message passing (GAMP), is presented that provides computationally efficient approximate implementations of max-sum and sum-problem loopy belief propagation for such problems. The algorithm extends earlier approximate message passing methods to incorporate arbitrary distributions on both the input and output of the transform and can be applied to a wide range of problems in nonlinear compressed sensing and learning. Extending an analysis by Bayati and Montanari, we argue that the asymptotic componentwise behavior of the GAMP method under large, i.i.d. Gaussian transforms is described by a simple set of state evolution (SE) equations. From the SE equations, one can emph predict the asymptotic value of virtually any componentwise performance metric including mean-squared error or detection accuracy. Moreover, the analysis is valid for arbitrary input and output distributions, even when the corresponding optimization problems are non-convex. The results match predictions by Guo and Wang for relaxed belief propagation on large sparse matrices and, in certain instances, also agree with the optimal performance predicted by the replica method. The GAMP methodology thus provides a computationally efficient methodology, applicable to a large class of non-Gaussian estimation problems with precise asymptotic performance guarantees.',

	{'abstract': u'Open source projects often maintain open bug repositories during development and maintenance, and the reporters often point out straightly or implicitly the reasons why bugs occur when they submit them. The comments about a bug are very valuable for developers to locate and fix the bug. Meanwhile, it is very common in large software for programmers to override or overload some methods according to the same logic. If one method causes a bug, it is obvious that other overridden or overloaded methods maybe cause related or similar bugs. In this paper, we propose and implement a tool Rebug- Detector, which detects related bugs using bug information and code features. Firstly, it extracts bug features from bug information in bug repositories; secondly, it locates bug methods from source code, and then extracts code features of bug methods; thirdly, it calculates similarities between each overridden or overloaded method and bug methods; lastly, it determines which method maybe causes potential related or similar bugs. We evaluate Rebug-Detector on an open source project: Apache Lucene-Java. Our tool totally detects 61 related bugs, including 21 real bugs and 10 suspected bugs, and it costs us about 15.5 minutes. The results show that bug features and code features extracted by our tool are useful to find real bugs in existing projects.',

	{'abstract': u'Low-power and Lossy Networks (LLNs), like wireless networks based upon the IEEE 802.15.4 standard, have strong energy constraints, and are moreover subject to frequent transmission errors, not only due to congestion but also to collisions and to radio channel conditions. This paper introduces an analytical model to compute the total energy consumption in an LLN due to the TCP protocol. The model allows us to highlight some tradeoffs as regards the choice of the TCP maximum segment size, of the Forward Error Correction (FEC) redundancy ratio, and of the number of link-layer retransmissions, in order to minimize the total energy consumption.',

	{'abstract': u'A new approach to the static route planning problem, based on a multi-staging concept and a emph notion, is presented. The main goal (besides implied efficiency of planning) of our approach is to address---with a solid theoretical foundation---the following two practically motivated aspects: a emph and a very emph space of a small navigation device, which both do not seem to be among the chief objectives of many other studies. We show how our novel idea can tackle both these seemingly unrelated aspects at once, and may also contribute to other established route planning approaches with which ours can be naturally combined. We provide a theoretical proof that our approach efficiently computes exact optimal routes within this concept, as well as we demonstrate with experimental results on publicly available road networks of the US the good practical performance of the solution.',

	{'abstract': u"We analyze the problem of distributed power allocation for orthogonal multiple access channels by considering a continuous non-cooperative game whose strategy space represents the users' distribution of transmission power over the network's channels. When the channels are static, we find that this game admits an exact potential function and this allows us to show that it has a unique equilibrium almost surely. Furthermore, using the game's potential property, we derive a modified version of the replicator dynamics of evolutionary game theory which applies to this continuous game, and we show that if the network's users employ a distributed learning scheme based on these dynamics, then they converge to equilibrium exponentially quickly. On the other hand, a major challenge occurs if the channels do not remain static but fluctuate stochastically over time, following a stationary ergodic process. In that case, the associated ergodic game still admits a unique equilibrium, but the learning analysis becomes much more complicated because the replicator dynamics are no longer deterministic. Nonetheless, by employing results from the theory of stochastic approximation, we show that users still converge to the game's unique equilibrium. Our analysis hinges on a game-theoretical result which is of independent interest: in finite player games which admit a (possibly nonlinear) convex potential function, the replicator dynamics (suitably modified to account for nonlinear payoffs) converge to an eps-neighborhood of an equilibrium at time of order O(log(1/eps)).",

An improvement of an existing method to compute inverse systems is presented, which avoids redundant computation and reduces the size of the intermediate linear systems to solve. We derive a one-step deflation technique, from the description of the multiplicity structure in terms of differentials. The deflated system can be used in Newton-based iterative schemes with quadratic convergence. Starting from a polynomial system and a small-enough neighborhood, we obtain a criterion for the existence and uniqueness of a singular root of a given multiplicity structure, applying a well-chosen symbolic perturbation. Standard verification methods, based eg. on interval arithmetic and a fixed point theorem, are employed to certify that there exists a unique perturbed system with a singular root in the domain. Applications to topological degree computation and to the analysis of real branches of an implicit curve illustrate the method.',

Linear communication channels may be modeled using linear compact operators on Banach or Hilbert spaces and the number of degrees of freedom of such channels is defined to be the number of linearly independent signals that may be communicated over this channel, where the channel is restricted by a threshold noise level. Kolmogorov numbers are a particular example of -numbers, which are defined over the class of bounded operators between Banach spaces. We demonstrate that these two concepts are closely related, namely that the Kolmogorov numbers correspond to the "jump points" in the function relating numbers of degrees of freedom with the noise level . We also establish a useful numerical computation result for evaluating Kolmogorov numbers of compact operators.',

	{'abstract': u'Data centers are the building blocks of IT business organizations providing the capabilities of centralized repository for storage, management, networking and dissemination of data. With the rapid increase in the capacity and size of data centers, there is a continuous increase in the demand for energy consumption. These data centers not only consume a tremendous amount of energy but are riddled with IT inefficiencies. All data center are plagued with thousands of servers as major components. These servers consume huge energy without performing useful work. In an average server environment, 30% of the servers are "dead" only consuming energy, without being properly utilized. Their utilization ratio is only 5 to 10 percent. This paper focuses on the use of an emerging technology called virtualization to achieve energy efficient data centers by providing a solution called server consolidation. It increases the utilization ratio up to 50% saving huge amount of energy. Server consolidation helps in implementing green data centers to ensure that IT infrastructure contributes as little as possible to the emission of green house gases, and helps to regain power and cooling capacity, recapture resilience and dramatically reducing energy costs and total cost of ownership.',

	{'abstract': u'In sequential logic there is an order in which the atomic propositions in an expression are evaluated. This order allows the same atomic proposition to have different values depending on which atomic propositions have already been evaluated. In the sequential propositional logic discussed in this thesis, such valuations are called "reactive" valuations, in contrast to "static" valuations as are common in e.g. ordinary propositional logic. There are many classes of these reactive valuations e.g., we can define a class of reactive valuations such that the value for each atomic proposition remains the same until another atomic proposition is evaluated. This Master of Logic thesis consists of a study of some of the properties of this logic. We take a closer look at some of the classes of reactive valuations. We particularly focus on the relation between the axiomatization and the semantics. Consequently, the main part of this thesis focuses on proving soundness and completeness. Furthermore, we show that the axioms in the provided axiomatizations are independent i.e., there are no redundant axioms present. Finally, we show -completeness for two classes of reactive valuations.',

	{'abstract': u'We consider in this paper the potential for ex ante prediction of the cascade size in a model of binary choice with externalities (Schelling 1973, Watts 2002). Agents are connected on a network and can be in one of two states of the world, 0 or 1. Initially, all are in state 0 and a small number of seeds are selected at random to switch to state1. A simple threshold rule specifies whether other agents switch subsequently. The cascade size (the percolation) is the proportion of all agents which eventually switches to state 1. We select information on the connectivity of the initial seeds, the connectivity of the agents to which they are connected, the thresholds of these latter agents, and the thresholds of the agents to which these are connected. We obtain results for random, small world and scale -free networks with different network parameters and numbers of initial seeds. The results are robust with respect to these factors. We perform least squares regression of the logit transformation of the cascade size (Hosmer and Lemeshow 1989) on these potential explanatory variables. We find considerable explanatory power for the ex ante prediction of cascade sizes. For the random networks, on average 32 per cent of the variance of the cascade sizes is explained, 40 per cent for the small world and 46 per cent for the scale-free. The connectivity variables are hardly ever significant in the regressions, whether relating to the seeds themselves or to the agents connected to the seeds. In contrast, the information on the thresholds of agents contains much more explanatory power. This supports the conjecture of Watts and Dodds (2007.) that large cascades are driven by a small mass of easily influenced agents.',

	{'abstract': u'Intrusion detection systems have become a key component in ensuring the safety of systems and networks. As networks grow in size and speed continues to increase, it is crucial that efficient scalable techniques should be developed for IDS systems. Signature based detection is the most extensively used threat detection technique for Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS). One of the foremost challenges for signaturebased IDS systems is how to keep up with large volume of incoming traffic when each packet needs to be compared with every signature in the database. When an IDS cannot keep up with the traffic flood, all it can do is to drop packets, therefore, may miss potential attacks. This paper proposes a new model called Dynamic Multi-Layer Signature based IDS using Mobile Agents, which can detect imminent threats with very high success rate by dynamically and automatically creating and using small and efficient multiple databases, and at the same time, provide mechanism to update these small signature databases at regular intervals using Mobile Agents',

	{'abstract': u'Online video chat services such as Chatroulette, Omegle, and vChatter that randomly match pairs of users in video chat sessions are fast becoming very popular, with over a million users per month in the case of Chatroulette. A key problem encountered in such systems is the presence of flashers and obscene content. This problem is especially acute given the presence of underage minors in such systems. This paper presents SafeVchat, a novel solution to the problem of flasher detection that employs an array of image detection algorithms. A key contribution of the paper concerns how the results of the individual detectors are fused together into an overall decision classifying the user as misbehaving or not, based on Dempster-Shafer Theory. The paper introduces a novel, motion-based skin detection method that achieves significantly higher recall and better precision. The proposed methods have been evaluated over real world data and image traces obtained from Chatroulette.com.',

We have proposed to use the rotated complex wavelet filters (RCWF) and dual tree complex wavelet transform(DTCWT) together to derive signature feature extraction, which captures information in twelve different directions. In identification phase, Canberra distance measure is used. The proposed method is compared with discrete wavelet transform (DWT). From experimental results it is found that signature identification rate of proposed method is superior over DWT',

	{'abstract': u'Location distinction is defined as determining whether or not the position of a device has changed. We introduce methods and metrics for performing location distinction in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) wireless networks. Using MIMO channel measurements from two different testbeds, we evaluate the performance of temporal signature-based location distinction with varying system parameters, and show that it can be applied to MIMO channels with favorable results. In particular, a 2x2 MIMO channel with a bandwidth of 80 MHz allows a 64-fold reduction in miss rate over the SISO channel for a fixed false alarm rate, achieving as small as 4 x 10^-4 probability of false alarm for a 2.4 x 10^-4 probability of missed detection. The very high reliability of MIMO location distinction enables location distinction systems to detect the change in position of a transmitter even when using a single receiver.',

The second approach is based on a generalization of the derivative to parser combinators. The payoff of these techniques is a small (less than 250 lines of code), easy-to-implement parsing library capable of parsing arbitrary context-free grammars into lazy parse forests. Implementations for both Scala and Haskell are provided. Preliminary experiments with S-Expressions parsed millions of tokens per second, which suggests this technique is efficient enough for use in practice.",

	{'abstract': u"Since the information available is fundamental for our perceptions and opinions, we are interested in understanding the conditions allowing for a good information to be disseminated. This paper explores opinion dynamics by means of multi-agent based simulations when agents get informed by different sources of information. The scenario implemented includes three main streams of information acquisition, differing in both the contents and the perceived reliability of the messages spread. Agents' internal opinion is updated either by accessing one of the information sources, namely media and experts, or by exchanging information with one another. They are also endowed with cognitive mechanisms to accept, reject or partially consider the acquired information. We expect that peer-to--peer communication and reliable information sources are able both to reduce biased perceptions and to inhibit information cheating, possibly performed by the media as stated by the agenda-setting theory. In the paper, after having shortly presented both the hypotheses and the model, the simulation design will be specified and results will be discussed with respect to the hypotheses. Some considerations and ideas for future studies will conclude the paper.",

	{'abstract': u"The study of the interplay between the testability of properties of Boolean functions and the invariances acting on their domain which preserve the property was initiated by Kaufman and Sudan (STOC 2008). Invariance with respect to F_2-linear transformations is arguably the most common symmetry exhibited by natural properties of Boolean functions on the hypercube. Hence, an important goal in Property Testing is to describe necessary and sufficient conditions for the testability of linear-invariant properties. This direction was explicitly proposed for investigation in a recent survey of Sudan. We obtain the following results: 1. We show that every linear-invariant property that can be characterized by forbidding induced solutions to a (possibly infinite) set of linear equations can be tested with one-sided error. 2. We show that every linear-invariant property that can be tested with one-sided error can be characterized by forbidding induced solutions to a (possibly infinite) set of systems of linear equations. We conjecture that our result from item (1) can be extended to cover systems of linear equations. We further show that the validity of this conjecture would have the following implications: 1. It would imply that every linear-invariant property that is closed under restrictions to linear subspaces is testable with one-sided error. Such a result would unify several previous results on testing Boolean functions, such as the testability of low-degree polynomials and of Fourier dimensionality. 2. It would imply that a linear-invariant property P is testable with one-sided error if and only if P is closed under restrictions to linear subspaces, thus resolving Sudan's problem.",

	{'abstract': u'The purpose of a wireless sensor network (WSN) is to provide the users with access to the information of interest from data gathered by spatially distributed sensors. Generally the users require only certain aggregate functions of this distributed data. Computation of this aggregate data under the end-to-end information flow paradigm by communicating all the relevant data to a central collector node is a highly inefficient solution for this purpose. An alternative proposition is to perform in-network computation. This, however, raises questions such as: what is the optimal way to compute an aggregate function from a set of statistically correlated values stored in different nodes; what is the security of such aggregation as the results sent by a compromised or faulty node in the network can adversely affect the accuracy of the computed result. In this paper, we have presented an energy-efficient aggregation algorithm for WSNs that is secure and robust against malicious insider attack by any compromised or faulty node in the network. In contrast to the traditional snapshot aggregation approach in WSNs, a node in the proposed algorithm instead of unicasting its sensed information to its parent node, broadcasts its estimate to all its neighbors. This makes the system more fault-tolerant and increase the information availability in the network. The simulations conducted on the proposed algorithm have produced results that demonstrate its effectiveness.',

	{'abstract': u'this paper presents an enhancement of the medial axis algorithm to be used for finding the optimal shortest path for developed cognitive map. The cognitive map has been developed, based on the architectural blueprint maps. The idea for using the medial-axis is to find main path central pixels; each center pixel represents the center distance between two side boarder pixels. The need for these pixels in the algorithm comes from the need of building a network of nodes for the path, where each node represents a turning in the real world (left, right, critical left, critical right...). The algorithm also ignores from finding the center pixels paths that are too small for intelligent robot navigation. The Idea of this algorithm is to find the possible shortest path between start and end points. The goal of this research is to extract a simple, robust representation of the shape of the cognitive map together with the optimal shortest path between start and end points. The intelligent robot will use this algorithm in order to decrease the time that is needed for sweeping the targeted building.',

	{'abstract': u'Contemporary personal computing devices are increasingly required to be portable and mobile enabling user\'s wireless access, to wired network infrastructures and services. This approach to mobile computing and communication is only appropriate in situations where a coherent infrastructure is available. There are many situations where these requirements are not fulfilled such as; developing nations, rural areas, natural disasters, and military conflicts to name but a few. A practical solution is to use mobile devices interconnected via a wireless medium to form a network, known as a Mobile Ad-hoc Network (MANET), and provide the services normally found in wired networks. Security in MANETs is an issue of paramount importance due to the wireless nature of the communication links. Additionally due to the lack of central administration security issues are different from conventional networks. For the purposes of this article we have used the "WMN test-bed" to enable secure routing in MANETs. The use of cryptography is an efficient proven way of securing data in communications, but some cryptographic algorithms are not as efficient as others and require more processing power, which is detrimental to MANETs. In this article we have assessed different cryptographic approaches to securing the OLSR (Optimised Link State Routing) protocol to provide a basis for research. We conclude the paper with a series of performance evaluation results regarding different cryptographic and hashing schemes. Our findings clearly show that the most efficient combination of algorithms used for authentication and encryption are SHA-1 and AES respectively. Using this combination over their counterparts will lead to a considerable reduction in processing time and delay on the network, creating an efficient transaction moving towards satisfying resource constraints and security requirements.',

	{'abstract': u'We consider a single hop interference network with transmitters and receivers, all having antennas. Each transmitter emits an independent message and each receiver requests an arbitrary subset of the messages. This generalizes the well-known -user -antenna interference channel, where each message is requested by a unique receiver. For our setup, we derive the degrees of freedom (DoF) region. The achievability scheme generalizes the interference alignment schemes proposed by Cadambe and Jafar. In particular, we achieve general points in the DoF region by using multiple base vectors and aligning all interferers at a given receiver to the interferer with the largest DoF. As a byproduct, we obtain the DoF region for the original interference channel. We also discuss extensions of our approach where the same region can be achieved by considering a reduced set of interference alignment constraints, thus reducing the time-expansion duration needed. The DoF region for the considered system depends only on a subset of receivers whose demands meet certain characteristics. The geometric shape of the DoF region is also discussed.',

	{'abstract': u'We consider a two-way relay network, where two source nodes, S1 and S2, exchange information through a cluster of relay nodes. The relay nodes receive the sum signal from S1 and S2 in the first time slot. In the second time slot, each relay node multiplies its received signal by a complex coefficient and retransmits the signal to the two source nodes, which leads to a collaborative two-way beamforming system. By applying the principle of analog network coding, each receiver at S1 and S2 cancels the "self-interference" in the received signal from the relay cluster and decodes the message. This paper studies the 2-dimensional achievable rate region for such a two-way relay network with collaborative beamforming. With different assumptions of channel reciprocity between the source-relay and relay-source channels, the achievable rate region is characterized under two setups. First, with reciprocal channels, we investigate the achievable rate regions when the relay cluster is subject to a sum-power constraint or individual-power constraints. We show that the optimal beamforming vectors obtained from solving the weighted sum inverse-SNR minimization (WSISMin) problems are sufficient to characterize the corresponding achievable rate region. Furthermore, we derive the closed form solutions for those optimal beamforming vectors and consequently propose the partially distributed algorithms to implement the optimal beamforming, where each relay node only needs the local channel information and one global parameter. Second, with the non-reciprocal channels, the achievable rate regions are also characterized for both the sum-power constraint case and the individual-power constraint case. Although no closed-form solutions are available under this setup, we present efficient numerical algorithms.',

	{'abstract': u'One unfortunate consequence of the success story of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) in separate research communities is an ever-growing gap between theory and practice. Even though there is a increasing number of algorithmic methods for WSNs, the vast majority has never been tried in practice; conversely, many practical challenges are still awaiting efficient algorithmic solutions. The main cause for this discrepancy is the fact that programming sensor nodes still happens at a very technical level. We remedy the situation by introducing Wiselib, our algorithm library that allows for simple implementations of algorithms onto a large variety of hardware and software. This is achieved by employing advanced C++ techniques such as templates and inline functions, allowing to write generic code that is resolved and bound at compile time, resulting in virtually no memory or computation overhead at run time. The Wiselib runs on different host operating systems, such as Contiki, iSense OS, and ScatterWeb. Furthermore, it runs on virtual nodes simulated by Shawn. For any algorithm, the Wiselib provides data structures that suit the specific properties of the target platform. Algorithm code does not contain any platform-specific specializations, allowing a single implementation to run natively on heterogeneous networks. In this paper, we describe the building blocks of the Wiselib, and analyze the overhead. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by showing how routing algorithms can be implemented. We also report on results from experiments with real sensor-node hardware.',

	{'abstract': u'In view of the fact that routing algorithms are network layer entities and the varying performance of any routing algorithm depends on the underlying networks. Localized routing algorithms avoid the problems associated with the maintenance of global network state by using statistics of flow blocking probabilities. We developed a new network parameter that can be used to predict which network topology gives better performance on the quality of localized QoS routing algorithms. Using this parameter we explore a simple model that can be rewired to introduce increasing the performance. We find that this model have small characteristic path length.

	{'abstract': u'In this paper we focus on some aspects related to modeling and formal verification of embedded systems. Many models have been proposed to represent embedded systems. These models encompass a broad range of styles, characteristics, and application domains and include the extensions of finite state machines, data flow graphs, communication processes and Petri nets. In this report, we have used a PRES+ model (Petri net based Representation for Embedded Systems) as an extension of classical Petri net model that captures concurrency, timing behaviour of embedded systems; it allows systems to be representative in different levels of abstraction and improves expressiveness by allowing the token to carry information. Modeling using PRES+, as discussed above, may be convenient for specifying the input behaviour because it supports concurrency. However, there is no equivalence checking method reported in the literature for PRES+ models to the best of our knowledge. In contrast, equivalence checking of FSMD models exist. As a first step, therefore, we seek to devise an algorithm to translate PRES+ models to FSMD models and we seek to hand execute our algorithm on a real life example and we have to translate two versions of PRES+ models to FSMD models. Then using existing equivalence checker we have checked the equivalence between two FSMD models.',

We formulate intervention games, propose a solution concept of intervention equilibrium, and prove its existence in a finite intervention game. We apply our framework to resource sharing scenarios in wireless communications, whose non-cooperative outcomes without intervention yield suboptimal performance. We derive analytical results and analyze illustrative examples in the cases of imperfect and perfect monitoring. In the case of imperfect monitoring, intervention schemes can improve the suboptimal performance of non-cooperative equilibrium when the intervention device has a sufficiently accurate monitoring technology, although it may not be possible to achieve the best feasible performance. In the case of perfect monitoring, the best feasible performance can be obtained with an intervention scheme when the intervention device has a sufficiently strong intervention capability.',

	{'abstract': u'Security is important for many sensor network applications. Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) are often deployed in hostile environments as static or mobile, where an adversary can physically capture some of the nodes. once a node is captured, adversary collects all the credentials like keys and identity etc. the attacker can re-program it and replicate the node in order to eavesdrop the transmitted messages or compromise the functionality of the network. Identity theft leads to two types attack: clone and sybil. In particularly a harmful attack against sensor networks where one or more node(s) illegitimately claims an identity as replicas is known as the node replication attack. The replication attack can be exceedingly injurious to many important functions of the sensor network such as routing, resource allocation, misbehavior detection, etc. This paper analyzes the threat posed by the replication attack and several novel techniques to detect and defend against the replication attack, and analyzes their effectiveness in both static and mobile WSN.',

We describe the state of the art of infrastructural cloud, which is essential in the decision making on cloud adoption, and highlight the challenges that can limit the scale and speed of the adoption. We then suggest a strategic framework for designing a high performance cloud system. This framework is applicable when transformation cloudbased deployment model collides with some constraints.

	{'abstract': u'A fast, efficient and scalable algorithm is proposed, in this paper, for re-encoding of perceptually quantized wavelet-packet transform (WPT) coefficients of audio and high quality speech and is called "adaptive variable degree-k zero-trees" (AVDZ). The quantization process is carried out by taking into account some basic perceptual considerations, and achieves good subjective quality with low complexity. The performance of the proposed AVDZ algorithm is compared with two other zero-tree-based schemes comprising: 1- Embedded Zero-tree Wavelet (EZW) and 2- The set partitioning in hierarchical trees (SPIHT). Since EZW and SPIHT are designed for image compression, some modifications are incorporated in these schemes for their better matching to audio signals. It is shown that the proposed modifications can improve their performance by about 15-25%. Furthermore, it is concluded that the proposed AVDZ algorithm outperforms these modified versions in terms of both output average bit-rates and computation times.',

	{'abstract': u'The decision boundaries of Bayes classifier are optimal because they lead to maximum probability of correct decision. It means if we knew the prior probabilities and the class-conditional densities, we could design a classifier which gives the lowest probability of error. However, in classification based on nonparametric density estimation methods such as Parzen windows, the decision regions depend on the choice of parameters such as window width. Moreover, these methods suffer from curse of dimensionality of the feature space and small sample size problem which severely restricts their practical applications. In this paper, we address these problems by introducing a novel dimension reduction and classification method based on local component analysis. In this method, by adopting an iterative cross-validation algorithm, we simultaneously estimate the optimal transformation matrices (for dimension reduction) and classifier parameters based on local information. The proposed method can classify the data with complicated boundary and also alleviate the course of dimensionality dilemma. Experiments on real data show the superiority of the proposed algorithm in term of classification accuracies for pattern classification applications like age, facial expression and character recognition. Keywords: Bayes classifier, curse of dimensionality dilemma, Parzen window, pattern classification, subspace learning.',

We study which monoids cause the extensions of context-free grammars, finite automata, or finite state transducers to exceed the capacity of the original model. Furthermore, we investigate when, in the extended automata model, the nondeterministic variant differs from the deterministic one in capacity. We show that all these conditions are in fact equivalent and present an algebraic characterization. In particular, the open question of whether every language generated by a valence grammar over a finite monoid is context-free is provided with a positive answer.',

	{'abstract': u'Kernel-based machine learning algorithms are based on mapping data from the original input feature space to a kernel feature space of higher dimensionality to solve a linear problem in that space. Over the last decade, kernel based classification and regression approaches such as support vector machines have widely been used in remote sensing as well as in various civil engineering applications. In spite of their better performance with different datasets, support vector machines still suffer from shortcomings such as visualization/interpretation of model, choice of kernel and kernel specific parameter as well as the regularization parameter. Relevance vector machines are another kernel based approach being explored for classification and regression with in last few years. The advantages of the relevance vector machines over the support vector machines is the availability of probabilistic predictions, using arbitrary kernel functions and not requiring setting of the regularization parameter. This paper presents a state-of-the-art review of SVM and RVM in remote sensing and provides some details of their use in other civil engineering application also.',

	{'abstract': u'In this paper we expose a dynamic traffic-classification scheme to support multimedia applications such as voice and broadband video transmissions over IEEE 802.11 Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs). Obviously, over a Wi-Fi link and to better serve these applications - which normally have strict bounded transmission delay or minimum link rate requirement - a service differentiation technique can be applied to the media traffic transmitted by the same mobile node using the well-known 802.11e Enhanced Distributed Channel Access (EDCA) protocol. However, the given EDCA mode does not offer user differentiation, which can be viewed as a deficiency in multi-access wireless networks. Accordingly, we propose a new inter-node priority access scheme for IEEE 802.11e networks which is compatible with the EDCA scheme. The proposed scheme joins a dynamic user-weight to each mobile station depending on its outgoing data, and therefore deploys inter-node priority for the channel access to complement the existing EDCA inter-frame priority. This provides efficient quality of service control across multiple users within the same coverage area of an access point. We provide performance evaluations to compare the proposed access model with the basic EDCA 802.11 MAC protocol mode to elucidate the quality improvement achieved for multimedia communication over 802.11 WLANs.',

	{'abstract': u'We study the problem of channel pairing and power allocation in a multi-channel multi-hop relay network to enhance the end-to-end data rate. Both amplify-and-forward and decode-and-forward relaying strategies are considered. Given fixed power allocation to the channels, we show that channel pairing over multiple hops can be decomposed into independent pairing problems at each relay, and a sorted-SNR channel pairing strategy is sum-rate optimal, where each relay pairs its incoming and outgoing channels by their SNR order. For the joint optimization of channel pairing and power allocation under both total and individual power constraints, we show that the problem can be decomposed into two separate subproblems solved independently. This separation principle is established by observing the equivalence between sorting SNRs and sorting channel gains in the jointly optimal solution. It significantly reduces the computational complexity in finding the jointly optimal solution. The solution for optimizing power allocation is also provided. Numerical results are provided to demonstrate substantial performance gain of the jointly optimal solution over some suboptimal alternatives. It is also observed that more gain is obtained from optimal channel pairing than optimal power allocation through judiciously exploiting the variation among multiple channels. Impact of the variation of channel gain, the number of channels, and the number of hops on the performance gain is also studied through numerical examples.',

	{'abstract': u'Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks have emerged as a popular means of causing mass targeted service disruptions, often for extended periods of time. The relative ease and low costs of launching such attacks, supplemented by the current inadequate sate of any viable defense mechanism, have made them one of the top threats to the Internet community today. Since the increasing popularity of web-based applications has led to several critical services being provided over the Internet, it is imperative to monitor the network traffic so as to prevent malicious attackers from depleting the resources of the network and denying services to legitimate users. This paper first presents a brief discussion on some of the important types of DDoS attacks that currently exist and some existing mechanisms to combat these attacks. It then points out the major drawbacks of the currently existing defense mechanisms and proposes a new mechanism for protecting a web-server against a DDoS attack. In the proposed mechanism, incoming traffic to the server is continuously monitored and any abnormal rise in the inbound traffic is immediately detected. The detection algorithm is based on a statistical analysis of the inbound traffic on the server and a robust hypothesis testing framework. Simulations carried out on the proposed mechanism have produced results that demonstrate effectiveness of the proposed defense mechanism against DDoS attacks.',

Therefore, Security of biometric information is essential requirement in this fast developing communication world. Thus, in this paper, we propose efficient and effective mechanism for confidentiality and authentication for biometric information transmitted by using arithmetic encoding representation over low bandwidth and unreliable channel. It enhances the speed of encryption, decryption and authentication process. It uses arithmetic encoding scheme and public key cryptography e.g. modified version of RSA algorithm called RSA-2 algorithm.',

	{'abstract': u'A collaborative framework for detecting the different sources in mixed signals is presented in this paper. The approach is based on C-HiLasso, a convex collaborative hierarchical sparse model, and proceeds as follows. First, we build a structured dictionary for mixed signals by concatenating a set of sub-dictionaries, each one of them learned to sparsely model one of a set of possible classes. Then, the coding of the mixed signal is performed by efficiently solving a convex optimization problem that combines standard sparsity with group and collaborative sparsity. The present sources are identified by looking at the sub-dictionaries automatically selected in the coding. The collaborative filtering in C-HiLasso takes advantage of the temporal/spatial redundancy in the mixed signals, letting collections of samples collaborate in identifying the classes, while allowing individual samples to have different internal sparse representations. This collaboration is critical to further stabilize the sparse representation of signals, in particular the class/sub-dictionary selection. The internal sparsity inside the sub-dictionaries, as naturally incorporated by the hierarchical aspects of C-HiLasso, is critical to make the model consistent with the essence of the sub-dictionaries that have been trained for sparse representation of each individual class. We present applications from speaker and instrument identification and texture separation. In the case of audio signals, we use sparse modeling to describe the short-term power spectrum envelopes of harmonic sounds. The proposed pitch independent method automatically detects the number of sources on a recording.',

	{'abstract': u'Submodular maximization generalizes many fundamental problems in discrete optimization, including Max-Cut in directed/undirected graphs, maximum coverage, maximum facility location and marketing over social networks. In this paper we consider the problem of maximizing any submodular function subject to knapsack constraints, where is a fixed constant. We establish a strong relation between the discrete problem and its continuous relaxation, obtained through of the submodular function. Formally, we show that, for any non-negative submodular function, an -approximation algorithm for the continuous relaxation implies a randomized -approximation algorithm for the discrete problem. We use this relation to improve the best known approximation ratio for the problem to , for any , and to obtain a nearly optimal approximation ratio for the monotone case, for any . We further show that the probabilistic domain defined by a continuous solution can be reduced to yield a polynomial size domain, given an oracle for the extension by expectation. This leads to a deterministic version of our technique.',

	{'abstract': u'We present a version of the HOL Light system that supports undoing definitions in such a way that this does not compromise the soundness of the logic. In our system the code that keeps track of the constants that have been defined thus far has been moved out of the kernel. This means that the kernel now is purely functional. The changes to the system are small. All existing HOL Light developments can be run by the stateless system with only minor changes. The basic principle behind the system is not to name constants by strings, but by pairs consisting of a string and a definition. This means that the data structures for the terms are all merged into one big graph. OCaml - the implementation language of the system - can use pointer equality to establish equality of data structures fast. This allows the system to run at acceptable speeds. Our system runs at about 85% of the speed of the stateful version of HOL Light.',

Wireless ad hoc networks such as mobile ad hoc networks, wireless sensor networks and wireless mesh networks are the promising alternatives in such type of situations. The security requirements for emergency response communications include privacy, data integrity, authentication, key management, access control and availability. Various ad hoc communication frameworks have been proposed for emergency response situations. The majority of the proposed frameworks don't provide adequate security services for reliable and secure information exchange.

An achievable rate region with structural properties satisfied by the 2-user AWGN Broadcast Channel capacity region is assumed. It is shown that even though all data are available at the beginning, a non-negative amount of energy from each energy harvest is deferred for later use such that the transmit power starts at its lowest value and rises as time progresses. The optimal scheduler ends the transmission to both users at the same time.

	{'abstract': u'The typical mathematical language systematically exploits notational and logical abuses whose resolution requires not just the knowledge of domain specific notation and conventions, but not trivial skills in the given mathematical discipline. A large part of this background knowledge is expressed in form of equalities and isomorphisms, allowing mathematicians to freely move between different incarnations of the same entity without even mentioning the transformation. Providing ITP-systems with similar capabilities seems to be a major way to improve their intelligence, and to ease the communication between the user and the machine. The present paper discusses our experience of integration of a superposition calculus within the Matita interactive prover, providing in particular a very flexible, "smart" application tactic, and a simple, innovative approach to automation.',

	{'abstract': u'Chaotic communications based on semiconductor lasers have aroused great research interest since 1990s. Physical-layer encryption using chaotic lasers is an alternative to transmit message rapidly and confidentially. There are some practical devices and setups for optical chaotic communications, which are intuitively considered to be secure. However, there is lack of a set of security evaluation rules for these communication setups. According to the recent literature, we summarize several criteria for optical chaotic communications to evaluate the security and point out some methods to enhance the security. These criteria and suggested rules are very helpful in designing secure communication systems using chaotic lasers. Finally we propose some possible hot topics on security analysis of optical chaotic communications in future.',

	{'abstract': u'We present an item-based approach for collaborative filtering. We determine a list of recommended items for a user by considering their previous purchases. Additionally other features of the users could be considered such as page views, search queries, etc... In particular we address the problem of efficiently comparing items. Our algorithm can efficiently approximate an estimate of the similarity between two items. As measure of similarity we use an approximation of the Jaccard similarity that can be computed by constant time operations and one bitwise OR. Moreover we improve the accuracy of the similarity by introducing the concept of user preference for a given product, which both takes into account multiple purchases and purchases of related items. The product of the user preference and the Jaccard measure (or its approximation) is used as a score for deciding whether a given product has to be recommended.',

The projections are obtained by multiplying by a matrix --- called a CS matrix --- where . In this work, we ask the following question: given the triplet that defines the CS problem size, what are the deterministic limits on the performance of the best CS matrix in ? We select Restricted Isometry as the performance metric. We derive two deterministic converse bounds and one deterministic achievable bound on the Restricted Isometry for matrices in in terms of , and . The first converse bound (structural bound) is derived by exploiting the intricate relationships between the singular values of sub-matrices and the complete matrix. The second converse bound (packing bound) and the achievable bound (covering bound) are derived by recognizing the equivalence of CS matrices to codes on Grassmannian spaces. Simulations reveal that random Gaussian provide far from optimal performance. The derivation of the three bounds offers several new geometric insights that relate optimal CS matrices to equi-angular tight frames, the Welch bound, codes on Grassmannian spaces, and the Generalized Pythagorean Theorem (GPT).',

	{'abstract': u'There have been several approaches to provisioning traffic between core network nodes in Internet Service Provider (ISP) networks. Such approaches aim to minimize network delay, increase network capacity, and enhance network security services. MATE (Multipath Adaptive Traffic Engineering) protocol has been proposed for multipath adaptive traffic engineering between an ingress node (source) and an egress node (destination). Its novel idea is to avoid network congestion and attacks that might exist in edge and node disjoint paths between two core network nodes. This paper builds an adaptive, robust, and reliable traffic engineering scheme for better performance of communication network operations. This will also provision quality of service (QoS) and protection of traffic engineering to maximize network efficiency. Specifically, we present a new approach, S-MATE (secure MATE) is developed to protect the network traffic between two core nodes (routers or switches) in a cloud network. S-MATE secures against a single link attack/failure by adding redundancy in one of the operational paths between the sender and receiver. The proposed scheme can be built to secure core networks such as optical and IP networks.',

	{'abstract': u'Differential privacy is a promising approach to privacy preserving data analysis with a well-developed theory for functions. Despite recent work on implementing systems that aim to provide differential privacy, the problem of formally verifying that these systems have differential privacy has not been adequately addressed. This paper presents the first results towards automated verification of source code for differentially private interactive systems. We develop a formal probabilistic automaton model of differential privacy for systems by adapting prior work on differential privacy for functions. The main technical result of the paper is a sound proof technique based on a form of probabilistic bisimulation relation for proving that a system modeled as a probabilistic automaton satisfies differential privacy. The novelty lies in the way we track quantitative privacy leakage bounds using a relation family instead of a single relation. We illustrate the proof technique on a representative automaton motivated by PINQ, an implemented system that is intended to provide differential privacy. To make our proof technique easier to apply to realistic systems, we prove a form of refinement theorem and apply it to show that a refinement of the abstract PINQ automaton also satisfies our differential privacy definition. Finally, we begin the process of automating our proof technique by providing an algorithm for mechanically checking a restricted class of relations from the proof technique.',

	{'abstract': u'Traditional communication theory focuses on minimizing transmit power. However, communication links are increasingly operating at shorter ranges where transmit power can be significantly smaller than the power consumed in decoding. This paper models the required decoding power and investigates the minimization of total system power from two complementary perspectives. First, an isolated point-to-point link is considered. Using new lower bounds on the complexity of message-passing decoding, lower bounds are derived on decoding power. These bounds show that 1) there is a fundamental tradeoff between transmit and decoding power; 2) unlike the implications of the traditional "waterfall" curve which focuses on transmit power, the total power must diverge to infinity as error probability goes to zero; 3) Regular LDPCs, and not their known capacity-achieving irregular counterparts, can be shown to be power order optimal in some cases; and 4) the optimizing transmit power is bounded away from the Shannon limit. Second, we consider a collection of links. When systems both generate and face interference, coding allows a system to support a higher density of transmitter-receiver pairs (assuming interference is treated as noise). However, at low densities, uncoded transmission may be more power-efficient in some cases.',

	{'abstract': u'We consider the problem of computing numerical invariants of programs by abstract interpretation. Our method eschews two traditional sources of imprecision: (i) the use of widening operators for enforcing convergence within a finite number of iterations (ii) the use of merge operations (often, convex hulls) at the merge points of the control flow graph. It instead computes the least inductive invariant expressible in the domain at a restricted set of program points, and analyzes the rest of the code en bloc. We emphasize that we compute this inductive invariant precisely. For that we extend the strategy improvement algorithm of [Gawlitza and Seidl, 2007]. If we applied their method directly, we would have to solve an exponentially sized system of abstract semantic equations, resulting in memory exhaustion. Instead, we keep the system implicit and discover strategy improvements using SAT modulo real linear arithmetic (SMT). For evaluating strategies we use linear programming. Our algorithm has low polynomial space complexity and performs for contrived examples in the worst case exponentially many strategy improvement steps; this is unsurprising, since we show that the associated abstract reachability problem is Pi-p-2-complete.',

To make things even worse, the attacker does not have to be physically close to the communicating devices, he can use a device with a stronger antenna. The unique hardware address of a mobile device can often be linked to the identity of the user operating the device. This represents a violation of the user's privacy.

	{'abstract': u"There has been substantial progress recently in understanding toy problems of purely implicit signaling. These are problems where the source and the channel are implicit -- the message is generated endogenously by the system, and the plant itself is used as a channel. In this paper, we explore how implicit and explicit communication can be used synergistically to reduce control costs. The setting is an extension of Witsenhausen's counterexample where a rate-limited external channel connects the two controllers. Using a semi-deterministic version of the problem, we arrive at a binning-based strategy that can outperform the best known strategies by an arbitrarily large factor. We also show that our binning-based strategy attains within a constant factor of the optimal cost for an asymptotically infinite-length version of the problem uniformly over all problem parameters and all rates on the external channel. For the scalar case, although our results yield approximate optimality for each fixed rate, we are unable to prove approximately-optimality uniformly over all rates.",

In arithmetic, 'division by zero' is an undefined operation and any attempt at extending logic for algebraic division to incorporate division by zero has resulted in paradoxes and fallacies. However, there is no proven theorem or mathematical logic that suggests that, defining logic for division by zero would result in break-down of theory. Basing on this motivation, in this paper, we attempt at logically defining a solution for 'division by zero' problem.",

	{'abstract': u"This paper considers feedback load reduction for multiuser multiple input multiple output (MIMO) broadcast channel where the users' channel distributions are not homogeneous. A cluster-based feedback scheme is proposed such that the range of possible signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the users are divided into several clusters according to the order statistics of the users' SNRs. Each cluster has a corresponding threshold, and the users compare their measured instantaneous SNRs with the thresholds to determine whether and how many bits they should use to feed back their instantaneous SNRs. If a user's instantaneous SNR is lower than a certain threshold, the user does not feed back. Feedback load reduction is thus achieved. For a given number of clusters, the sum rate loss using the cluster-based feedback scheme is investigated. Then the minimum number of clusters given a maximum tolerable sum rate loss is derived. Through simulations, it is shown that, when the number of users is large, full multiuser diversity can be achieved by the proposed feedback scheme, which is more efficient than the conventional schemes.",

	{'abstract': u"We show that several important resource allocation problems in wireless networks fit within the common framework of Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs). Inspired by the requirements of these applications, where variables are located at distinct network devices that may not be able to communicate but may interfere, we define natural criteria that a CSP solver must possess in order to be practical. We term these algorithms decentralized CSP solvers. The best known CSP solvers were designed for centralized problems and do not meet these criteria. We introduce a stochastic decentralized CSP solver and prove that it will find a solution in almost surely finite time, should one exist, also showing it has many practically desirable properties. We benchmark the algorithm's performance on a well-studied class of CSPs, random k-SAT, illustrating that the time the algorithm takes to find a satisfying assignment is competitive with stochastic centralized solvers on problems with order a thousand variables despite its decentralized nature. We demonstrate the solver's practical utility for the problems that motivated its introduction by using it to find a non-interfering channel allocation for a network formed from data from downtown Manhattan.",

	{'abstract': u'In semantics and in programming practice, algebraic concepts such as monads or, essentially equivalently, (large) Lawvere theories are a well-established tool for modelling generic side-effects. An important issue in this context are combination mechanisms for such algebraic effects, which allow for the modular design of programming languages and verification logics. The most basic combination operators are sum and tensor: while the sum of effects is just their non-interacting union, the tensor imposes commutation of effects. However, for effects with unbounded arity, such as continuations or unbounded nondeterminism, it is not a priori clear whether these combinations actually exist in all cases. Here, we introduce the class of uniform effects, which includes unbounded nondeterminism and continuations, and prove that the tensor does always exist if one of the component effects is uniform, thus in particular improving on previous results on tensoring with continuations. We then treat the case of nondeterminism in more detail, and give an order-theoretic characterization of effects for which tensoring with nondeterminism is conservative, thus enabling nondeterministic arguments such as a generic version of the Fischer-Ladner encoding of control operators.',

We conduct an experimental study of our mechanism on both synthetic and real-world data that shows fast convergence to the optimum. We also explore a wide range of scenarios, varying from an arbitrary initial state (to be solved) to small disruptions in a previously optimal solution (to be recovered). Our experiments with the latter scenario show that our mechanism can be used as an online recovery scheme causing the system to re-converge to its optimum extremely fast.',

	{'abstract': u'The problem studied in this paper is ultrasound image reconstruction from frequency-domain measurements of the scattered field from an object with contrast in attenuation and sound speed. The case where the object has uniform but unknown contrast in these properties relative to the background is considered. Background clutter is taken into account in a physically realistic manner by considering an exact scattering model for randomly located small scatterers that vary in sound speed. The resulting statistical characteristics of the interference is incorporated into the imaging solution, which includes applying a total-variation minimization based approach where the relative effect of perturbation in sound speed to attenuation is included as a parameter. Convex optimization methods provide the basis for the reconstruction algorithm. Numerical data for inversion examples are generated by solving the discretized Lippman-Schwinger equation for the object and speckle-forming scatterers in the background. A statistical model based on the Born approximation is used for reconstruction of the object profile. Results are presented for a two dimensional problem in terms of classification performance and compared to minimum-l2-norm reconstruction. Classification using the proposed method is shown to be robust down to a signal-to-clutter ratio of less than 1 dB.',

	{'abstract': u"Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are rapidly emerging as an important new area in wireless and mobile computing research. Applications of WSNs are numerous and growing, and range from indoor deployment scenarios in the home and office to outdoor deployment scenarios in adversary's territory in a tactical battleground (Akyildiz et al., 2002). For military environment, dispersal of WSNs into an adversary's territory enables the detection and tracking of enemy soldiers and vehicles. For home/office environments, indoor sensor networks offer the ability to monitor the health of the elderly and to detect intruders via a wireless home security system. In each of these scenarios, lives and livelihoods may depend on the timeliness and correctness of the sensor data obtained from dispersed sensor nodes. As a result, such WSNs must be secured to prevent an intruder from obstructing the delivery of correct sensor data and from forging sensor data. To address the latter problem, end-to-end data integrity checksums and post-processing of senor data can be used to identify forged sensor data (Estrin et al., 1999; Hu et al., 2003a; Ye et al., 2004). The focus of this chapter is on routing security in WSNs. Most of the currently existing routing protocols for WSNs make an optimization on the limited capabilities of the nodes and the application-specific nature of the network, but do not any the security aspects of the protocols. Although these protocols have not been designed with security as a goal, it is extremely important to analyze their security properties. When the defender has the liabilities of insecure wireless communication, limited node capabilities, and possible insider threats, and the adversaries can use powerful laptops with high energy and long range communication to attack the network, designing a secure routing protocol for WSNs is obviously a non-trivial task.",

	{'abstract': u'Modern high-end machines feature multiple processor packages, each of which contains multiple independent cores and integrated memory controllers connected directly to dedicated physical RAM. These packages are connected via a shared bus, creating a system with a heterogeneous memory hierarchy. Since this shared bus has less bandwidth than the sum of the links to memory, aggregate memory bandwidth is higher when parallel threads all access memory local to their processor package than when they access memory attached to a remote package. But, the impact of this heterogeneous memory architecture is not easily understood from vendor benchmarks. Even where these measurements are available, they provide only best-case memory throughput. This work presents a series of modifications to the well-known STREAM benchmark to measure the effects of NUMA on both a 48-core AMD Opteron machine and a 32-core Intel Xeon machine.',

	{'abstract': u"Wireless mesh networks (WMNs) have emerged as a key technology for next generation wireless broadband networks showing rapid progress and inspiring numerous compelling applications. A WMN comprises of a set of mesh routers (MRs) and mesh clients (MCs), where MRs are connected to the Internet backbone through the Internet gateways (IGWs). The MCs are wireless devices and communicate among themselves over possibly multi-hop paths with or without the involvement of MRs. User privacy and security have been primary concerns in WMNs due to their peer-to-peer network topology, shared wireless medium, stringent resource constraints, and highly dynamic environment. Moreover, to support real-time applications, WMNs must also be equipped with robust, reliable and efficient routing protocols so as to minimize the end-to-end latency. Design of a secure and efficient routing protocol for WMNs, therefore, is of paramount importance. In this paper, we propose an efficient and reliable routing protocol that also provides user anonymity in WMNs. The protocol is based on an accurate estimation of the available bandwidth in the wireless links and a robust estimation of the end-to-end delay in a routing path, and minimization of control message overhead. The user anonymity, authentication and data privacy is achieved by application of a novel protocol that is based on Rivest's ring signature scheme. Simulations carried out on the proposed protocol demonstrate that it is more efficient than some of the existing routing protocols.",

	{'abstract': u"A problem of index coding with side information was first considered by Y. Birk and T. Kol (IEEE INFOCOM, 1998). In the present work, a generalization of index coding scheme, where transmitted symbols are subject to errors, is studied. Error-correcting methods for such a scheme, and their parameters, are investigated. In particular, the following question is discussed: given the side information hypergraph of index coding scheme and the maximal number of erroneous symbols , what is the shortest length of a linear index code, such that every receiver is able to recover the required information? This question turns out to be a generalization of the problem of finding a shortest-length error-correcting code with a prescribed error-correcting capability in the classical coding theory. The Singleton bound and two other bounds, referred to as the -bound and the -bound, for the optimal length of a linear error-correcting index code (ECIC) are established. For large alphabets, a construction based on concatenation of an optimal index code with an MDS classical code, is shown to attain the Singleton bound. For smaller alphabets, however, this construction may not be optimal. A random construction is also analyzed. It yields another inexplicit bound on the length of an optimal linear ECIC. Finally, the decoding of linear ECIC's is discussed. The syndrome decoding is shown to output the exact message if the weight of the error vector is less or equal to the error-correcting capability of the corresponding ECIC.",

	{'abstract': u'The methods presented in this paper allow for a statistical analysis revealing centers of excellence around the world using programs that are freely available. Based on Web of Science data, field-specific excellence can be identified in cities where highly-cited papers were published significantly. Compared to the mapping approaches published hitherto, our approach is more analytically oriented by allowing the assessment of an observed number of excellent papers for a city (in the sample) against the expected number. Using this test, the approach cannot only identify the top performers in output but the "true jewels." These are cities locating authors who publish significantly more top cited papers than can be expected. As the examples in this paper show for physics, chemistry, and psychology, these cities do not necessarily have a high output of excellent papers.',

	{'abstract': u'This paper addresses cooperation in a multicell environment where base stations (BSs) wish to jointly serve multiple users, under a constrained-capacity backhaul. We point out that for finite backhaul capacity a trade-off between sharing user data, which allows for full MIMO cooperation, and not doing so, which reduces the setup to an interference channel but also requires less overhead, emerges. We optimize this trade-off by formulating a rate splitting approach in which non-shared data (private to each transmitter) and shared data are superposed. We derive the corresponding achievable rate region and obtain the optimal beamforming design for both shared and private symbols. We show how the capacity of the backhaul can be used to determine how much of the user data is worth sharing across multiple BSs, particularly depending on how strong the interference is.',

	{'abstract': u'We optimize modulation formats for the additive white Gaussian noise channel with a nonnegative input constraint, also known as the intensity-modulated direct detection channel, with and without confining them to a lattice structure. Our optimization criteria are the average electrical and optical power. The nonnegativity input signal constraint is translated into a conical constraint in signal space, and modulation formats are designed by sphere packing inside this cone. Some remarkably dense packings are found, which yield more power-efficient modulation formats than previously known. For example, at a spectral efficiency of 1 bit/s/Hz, the obtained modulation format offers a 0.86 dB average electrical power gain and 0.43 dB average optical power gain over the previously best known modulation formats to achieve a symbol error rate of 10^-6. This modulation turns out to have a lattice-based structure. At a spectral efficiency of 3/2 bits/s/Hz and to achieve a symbol error rate of 10^-6, the modulation format obtained for optimizing the average electrical power offers a 0.58 dB average electrical power gain over the best lattice-based modulation and 2.55 dB gain over the best previously known format. However, the modulation format optimized for average optical power offers a 0.46 dB average optical power gain over the best lattice-based modulation and 1.35 dB gain over the best previously known format.',

	{'abstract': u'A new approach is proposed, namely CSSF MIMO radar, which applies the technique of step frequency (SF) to compressive sensing (CS) based multi-input multi-output (MIMO) radar. The proposed approach enables high resolution range, angle and Doppler estimation, while transmitting narrowband pulses. The problem of joint angle-Doppler-range estimation is first formulated to fit the CS framework, i.e., as an L1 optimization problem. Direct solution of this problem entails high complexity as it employs a basis matrix whose construction requires discretization of the angle-Doppler-range space. Since high resolution requires fine space discretization, the complexity of joint range, angle and Doppler estimation can be prohibitively high. For the case of slowly moving targets, a technique is proposed that achieves significant complexity reduction by successively estimating angle-range and Doppler in a decoupled fashion and by employing initial estimates obtained via matched filtering to further reduce the space that needs to be digitized. Numerical results show that the combination of CS and SF results in a MIMO radar system that has superior resolution and requires far less data as compared to a system that uses a matched filter with SF.',

	{'abstract': u"Existing constructs for privacy concerns and behaviors do not adequately model deviations between user attitudes and behaviors. Although a number of studies have examined supposed deviations from rationality by online users, true explanations for these behaviors may lie in factors not previously addressed in privacy concern constructs. In particular, privacy attitudes and behavioral changes over time have not been examined within the context of an empirical study. This paper presents the results of an Agile, sprint-based longitudinal study of Social Media users conducted over a two year period between April of 2009 and March of 2011. This study combined concepts drawn from Privacy Regulation Theory with the constructs of the Internet Users' Information and Privacy Concern model to create a series of online surveys that examined changes of Social Media privacy attitudes and self-reported behaviors over time. The main findings of this study are that, over a two year period between 2009 and 2011, respondents' privacy concerns and distrust of Social Media Sites increased significantly, while their disclosure of personal information and willingness to connect with new online friends decreased significantly. Further qualitative interviews of selected respondents identified these changes as emblematic of users developing ad-hoc risk mitigation strategies to address privacy threats.",

	{'abstract': u'Access networks, in particular, Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) equipment, are a significant source of energy consumption for wireline operators. Replacing large monolithic DSLAMs with smaller remote DSLAM units closer to customers can reduce the energy consumption as well as increase the reach of the access network. This paper attempts to formalize the design and optimization of the "last mile" wireline access network with energy as one of the costs to be minimized. In particular, the placement of remote DSLAM units needs to be optimized. We propose solutions for two scenarios. For the scenario where an existing all-copper network from the central office to the customers is to be transformed into a fiber-copper network with remote DSLAM units, we present optimal polynomial-time solutions. In the green-field scenario, both the access network layout and the placement of remote DSLAM units must be determined. We show that this problem is NP-complete. We present an optimal ILP formulation and also design an efficient heuristic-based approach to build a power-and-cost-optimized access network. Our heuristic-based approach yields results that are very close to optimal. We show how the power consumption of the access network can be reduced by carefully laying the access network and introducing remote DSLAM units.',

Li et al.'s scheme is based on biometrics verification, smart card and one-way hash function, and it also uses the random nonce rather than a synchronized clock, and thus it is efficient in computational cost and more secure than Li-Hwang's scheme. Unfortunately, in this paper we show that Li et al.'s scheme still has some security weaknesses in their design. In order to withstand those weaknesses in their scheme, we further propose an improvement of their scheme so that the improved scheme always provides proper authentication and as a result, it establishes a session key between the user and the server at the end of successful user authentication.",

	{'abstract': u'The increasing popularity of web-based applications has led to several critical services being provided over the Internet. This has made it imperative to monitor the network traffic so as to prevent malicious attackers from depleting the resources of the network and denying services to legitimate users. This paper has presented a mechanism for protecting a web-server against a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack. Incoming traffic to the server is continuously monitored and any abnormal rise in the inbound traffic is immediately detected. The detection algorithm is based on a statistical analysis of the inbound traffic on the server and a robust hypothesis testing framework. While the detection process is on, the sessions from the legitimate sources are not disrupted and the load on the server is restored to the normal level by blocking the traffic from the attacking sources. To cater to different scenarios, the detection algorithm has various modules with varying level of computational and memory overheads for their execution. While the approximate modules are fast in detection and involve less overhead, they have lower detection accuracy. The accurate modules involve complex detection logic and hence involve more overhead for their execution, but they have very high detection accuracy. Simulations carried out on the proposed mechanism have produced results that demonstrate effectiveness of the scheme.',

	{'abstract': u'Knowledge compilation is an approach to tackle the computational intractability of general reasoning problems. According to this approach, knowledge bases are converted off-line into a target compilation language which is tractable for on-line querying. Reduced ordered binary decision diagram (ROBDD) is one of the most influential target languages. We generalize ROBDD by associating some implied literals in each node and the new language is called reduced ordered binary decision diagram with implied literals (ROBDD-L). Then we discuss a kind of subsets of ROBDD-L called ROBDD-i with precisely i implied literals (0 leq i leq infty). In particular, ROBDD-0 is isomorphic to ROBDD; ROBDD- infty requires that each node should be associated by the implied literals as many as possible. We show that ROBDD-i has uniqueness over some specific variables order, and ROBDD- infty is the most succinct subset in ROBDD-L and can meet most of the querying requirements involved in the knowledge compilation map. Finally, we propose an ROBDD-i compilation algorithm for any i and a ROBDD- infty compilation algorithm. Based on them, we implement a ROBDD-L package called BDDjLu and then get some conclusions from preliminary experimental results: ROBDD- infty is obviously smaller than ROBDD for all benchmarks; ROBDD- infty is smaller than the d-DNNF the benchmarks whose compilation results are relatively small; it seems that it is better to transform ROBDDs- infty into FBDDs and ROBDDs rather than straight compile the benchmarks.',

	{'abstract': u'In this paper, we study a simple correlation-based strategy for estimating the unknown delay and amplitude of a signal based on a small number of noisy, randomly chosen frequency-domain samples. We model the output of this "compressive matched filter" as a random process whose mean equals the scaled, shifted autocorrelation function of the template signal. Using tools from the theory of empirical processes, we prove that the expected maximum deviation of this process from its mean decreases sharply as the number of measurements increases, and we also derive a probabilistic tail bound on the maximum deviation. Putting all of this together, we bound the minimum number of measurements required to guarantee that the empirical maximum of this random process occurs sufficiently close to the true peak of its mean function. We conclude that for broad classes of signals, this compressive matched filter will successfully estimate the unknown delay (with high probability, and within a prescribed tolerance) using a number of random frequency-domain samples that scales inversely with the signal-to-noise ratio and only logarithmically in the in the observation bandwidth and the possible range of delays.',

	{'abstract': u'Colombian scientific journals are poorly represented in international digital libraries; however, through Google Scholar (GS) it is possible to determine their use by the community. Between the years of 2003 and 2007 a classification of 185 Colombian journals indexed in the Colombian National Bibliographical Index (IBNP) was performed using the information provided by GS, basing categorization on size indicators, indexation and citation. The indicators were analyzed by grouping the journals in two general areas: sciences and social sciences. In each area, the indicators provided by the digital libraries Scopus, Redalyc and Scielo were compared. Additionally, the indicators provided by IBNP journals categories (A1, A2, B and C) were also compared. The sciences and social sciences had a similar pattern in their indicators. The existence of positive correlations was established between some indicators and they predicted that the number of citations per journal in GS and the h index depends on its visibility in GS and Scopus. We put forward that the current IBNP categories (A1, A2, B or C) faintly reflect the use of journals by the community and we propose a classification based on the h index as an infometric indicator, which reflects not only its visibility in Google Scholar, but also its inclusion in certain international digital libraries, particularly Scopus. Our results may be applied to the creation of public policies regarding science and technology in Colombia and in developing countries.',

	{'abstract': u'We answer a problem posed in (G \'al, Kouck \'y, McKenzie 2008) regarding a restricted model of small-space computation, tailored for solving the GEN problem. They define two variants of "incremental branching programs", the syntactic variant defined by a restriction on the graph-theoretic paths in the program, and the more-general semantic variant in which the same restriction is enforced only on the consistent paths - those that are followed by at least one input. They show that exponential size is required for the syntactic variant, but leave open the problem of superpolynomial lower bounds for the semantic variant. Here we give an exponential lower bound for the semantic variant by generalizing lower bound arguments, from earlier work, for a similar restricted model tailored for solving a special case of GEN called Tree Evaluation.',

	{'abstract': u'A secret-key generation scheme based on a layered broadcasting strategy is introduced for slow-fading channels. In the model considered, Alice wants to share a key with Bob while keeping the key secret from Eve, who is a passive eavesdropper. Both Alice-Bob and Alice-Eve channels are assumed to undergo slow fading, and perfect channel state information (CSI) is assumed to be known only at the receivers during the transmission. In each fading slot, Alice broadcasts a continuum of coded layers and, hence, allows Bob to decode at the rate corresponding to the fading state (unknown to Alice). The index of a reliably decoded layer is sent back from Bob to Alice via a public and error-free channel and used to generate a common secret key. In this paper, the achievable secrecy key rate is first derived for a given power distribution over coded layers. The optimal power distribution is then characterized. It is shown that layered broadcast coding can increase the secrecy key rate significantly compared to single-level coding.',

	{'abstract': u'Ant Colony Optimisation (ACO) is an effective population-based meta-heuristic for the solution of a wide variety of problems. As a population-based algorithm, its computation is intrinsically massively parallel, and it is there- fore theoretically well-suited for implementation on Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). The ACO algorithm comprises two main stages: Tour construction and Pheromone update. The former has been previously implemented on the GPU, using a task-based parallelism approach. However, up until now, the latter has always been implemented on the CPU. In this paper, we discuss several parallelisation strategies for both stages of the ACO algorithm on the GPU. We propose an alternative data-based parallelism scheme for Tour construction, which fits better on the GPU architecture. We also describe novel GPU programming strategies for the Pheromone update stage. Our results show a total speed-up exceeding 28x for the Tour construction stage, and 20x for Pheromone update, and suggest that ACO is a potentially fruitful area for future research in the GPU domain.',

	{'abstract': u"Planarity Testing is the problem of determining whether a given graph is planar while planar embedding is the corresponding construction problem. The bounded space complexity of these problems has been determined to be exactly Logspace by Allender and Mahajan with the aid of Reingold's result. Unfortunately, the algorithm is quite daunting and generalizing it to say, the bounded genus case seems a tall order. In this work, we present a simple planar embedding algorithm running in logspace. We hope this algorithm will be more amenable to generalization. The algorithm is based on the fact that 3-connected planar graphs have a unique embedding, a variant of Tutte's criterion on conflict graphs of cycles and an explicit change of cycle basis.% for planar graphs. We also present a logspace algorithm to find obstacles to planarity, viz. a Kuratowski minor, if the graph is non-planar. To the best of our knowledge this is the first logspace algorithm for this problem.",

	{'abstract': u'The proliferation of imprecise data has motivated both researchers and the database industry to push statistical techniques into relational database management systems (RDBMSs). We study algorithms to maintain model-based views for a popular statistical technique, classification, inside an RDBMS in the presence of updates to the training examples. We make three technical contributions: (1) An algorithm that incrementally maintains classification inside an RDBMS. (2) An analysis of the above algorithm that shows that our algorithm is optimal among all deterministic algorithms (and asymptotically within a factor of 2 of a nondeterministic optimal). (3) An index structure based on the technical ideas that underlie the above algorithm which allows us to store only a fraction of the entities in memory. We apply our techniques to text processing, and we demonstrate that our algorithms provide several orders of magnitude improvement over non-incremental approaches to classification on a variety of data sets: such as the Cora, UCI Machine Learning Repository data sets, Citeseer, and DBLife.',

	{'abstract': u'In this paper, we propose a novel, effective and efficient probabilistic pruning criterion for probabilistic similarity queries on uncertain data. Our approach supports a general uncertainty model using continuous probabilistic density functions to describe the (possibly correlated) uncertain attributes of objects. In a nutshell, the problem to be solved is to compute the PDF of the random variable denoted by the probabilistic domination count: Given an uncertain database object B, an uncertain reference object R and a set D of uncertain database objects in a multi-dimensional space, the probabilistic domination count denotes the number of uncertain objects in D that are closer to R than B. This domination count can be used to answer a wide range of probabilistic similarity queries. Specifically, we propose a novel geometric pruning filter and introduce an iterative filter-refinement strategy for conservatively and progressively estimating the probabilistic domination count in an efficient way while keeping correctness according to the possible world semantics. In an experimental evaluation, we show that our proposed technique allows to acquire tight probability bounds for the probabilistic domination count quickly, even for large uncertain databases.',

	{'abstract': u'OLTP (On-Line Transaction Processing) is an important business system sector in various traditional and emerging online services. Due to the increasing number of users, OLTP systems require high throughput for executing tens of thousands of transactions in a short time period. Encouraged by the recent success of GPGPU (General-Purpose computation on Graphics Processors), we propose GPUTx, an OLTP engine performing high-throughput transaction executions on the GPU for in-memory databases. Compared with existing GPGPU studies usually optimizing a single task, transaction executions require handling many small tasks concurrently. Specifically, we propose the bulk execution model to group multiple transactions into a bulk and to execute the bulk on the GPU as a single task. The transactions within the bulk are executed concurrently on the GPU. We study three basic execution strategies (one with locks and the other two lock-free), and optimize them with the GPU features including the hardware support of atomic operations, the massive thread parallelism and the SPMD (Single Program Multiple Data) execution. We evaluate GPUTx on a recent NVIDIA GPU in comparison with its counterpart on a quad-core CPU. Our experimental results show that optimizations on GPUTx significantly improve the throughput, and the optimized GPUTx achieves 4-10 times higher throughput than its CPU-based counterpart on public transaction processing benchmarks.',

	{'abstract': u'This paper aims at answering the following two questions in privacy-preserving data analysis and publishing: What formal privacy guarantee (if any) does -anonymization provide? How to benefit from the adversary\'s uncertainty about the data? We have found that random sampling provides a connection that helps answer these two questions, as sampling can create uncertainty. The main result of the paper is that -anonymization, when done "safely", and when preceded with a random sampling step, satisfies -differential privacy with reasonable parameters. This result illustrates that "hiding in a crowd of " indeed offers some privacy guarantees. This result also suggests an alternative approach to output perturbation for satisfying differential privacy: namely, adding a random sampling step in the beginning and pruning results that are too sensitive to change of a single tuple. Regarding the second question, we provide both positive and negative results. On the positive side, we show that adding a random-sampling pre-processing step to a differentially-private algorithm can greatly amplify the level of privacy protection. Hence, when given a dataset resulted from sampling, one can utilize a much large privacy budget. On the negative side, any privacy notion that takes advantage of the adversary\'s uncertainty likely does not compose. We discuss what these results imply in practice.',

	{'abstract': u'In this paper we present GDR, a Guided Data Repair framework that incorporates user feedback in the cleaning process to enhance and accelerate existing automatic repair techniques while minimizing user involvement. GDR consults the user on the updates that are most likely to be beneficial in improving data quality. GDR also uses machine learning methods to identify and apply the correct updates directly to the database without the actual involvement of the user on these specific updates. To rank potential updates for consultation by the user, we first group these repairs and quantify the utility of each group using the decision-theory concept of value of information (VOI). We then apply active learning to order updates within a group based on their ability to improve the learned model. User feedback is used to repair the database and to adaptively refine the training set for the model. We empirically evaluate GDR on a real-world dataset and show significant improvement in data quality using our user guided repairing process. We also, assess the trade-off between the user efforts and the resulting data quality.',

	{'abstract': u'We consider the problem of human-assisted graph search: given a directed acyclic graph with some (unknown) target node(s), we consider the problem of finding the target node(s) by asking an omniscient human questions of the form "Is there a target node that is reachable from the current node?". This general problem has applications in many domains that can utilize human intelligence, including curation of hierarchies, debugging workflows, image segmentation and categorization, interactive search and filter synthesis. To our knowledge, this work provides the first formal algorithmic study of the optimization of human computation for this problem. We study various dimensions of the problem space, providing algorithms and complexity results. Our framework and algorithms can be used in the design of an optimizer for crowd-sourcing platforms such as Mechanical Turk.',

	{'abstract': u'Since the electricity bill of a data center constitutes a significant portion of its overall operational costs, reducing this has become important. We investigate cost reduction opportunities that arise by the use of uninterrupted power supply (UPS) units as energy storage devices. This represents a deviation from the usual use of these devices as mere transitional fail-over mechanisms between utility and captive sources such as diesel generators. We consider the problem of opportunistically using these devices to reduce the time average electric utility bill in a data center. Using the technique of Lyapunov optimization, we develop an online control algorithm that can optimally exploit these devices to minimize the time average cost. This algorithm operates without any knowledge of the statistics of the workload or electricity cost processes, making it attractive in the presence of workload and pricing uncertainties. An interesting feature of our algorithm is that its deviation from optimality reduces as the storage capacity is increased. Our work opens up a new area in data center power management.',

	{'abstract': u'This paper studies interference alignment (IA) based multi-cell cooperative resource allocation for the downlink OFDMA with universal frequency reuse. Unlike the traditional scheme that treats subcarriers as separate dimensions for resource allocation, the IA technique is utilized to enable frequency-domain precoding over parallel subcarriers. In this paper, the joint optimization of frequency-domain precoding via IA, subcarrier user selection and power allocation is investigated for a cooperative three-cell OFDMA system to maximize the downlink throughput. Numerical results for a simplified symmetric channel setup reveal that the IA-based scheme achieves notable throughput gains over the traditional scheme only when the inter-cell interference link has a comparable strength as the direct link, and the receiver SNR is sufficiently large. Motivated by this observation, a practical hybrid scheme is proposed for cellular systems with heterogenous channel conditions, where the total spectrum is divided into two subbands, over which the IAbased scheme and the traditional scheme are applied for resource allocation to users located in the cell-intersection region and cellnon- intersection region, respectively. It is shown that this hybrid resource allocation scheme flexibly exploits the downlink IA gains for OFDMA-based cellular systems.',

	{'abstract': u"Precoding for multiple-input, multiple-output (MIMO) antenna systems is considered with perfect channel knowledge available at both the transmitter and the receiver. For 2 transmit antennas and QAM constellations, an approximately optimal (with respect to the minimum Euclidean distance between points in the received signal space) real-valued precoder based on the singular value decomposition (SVD) of the channel is proposed, and it is shown to offer a maximum-likelihood (ML)-decoding complexity of for square -QAM. The proposed precoder is obtainable easily for arbitrary QAM constellations, unlike the known complex-valued optimal precoder by Collin et al. for 2 transmit antennas, which is in existence for 4-QAM alone with an ML-decoding complexity of (M=4) and is extremely hard to obtain for larger QAM constellations. The proposed precoder's loss in error performance for 4-QAM in comparison with the complex-valued optimal precoder is only marginal. Our precoding scheme is extended to higher number of transmit antennas on the lines of the E- precoder for 4-QAM by Vrigneau et al. which is an extension of the complex-valued optimal precoder for 4-QAM. Compared with the recently proposed and precoders, the error performance of our precoder is significantly better. It is shown that our precoder provides full-diversity for QAM constellations and this is supported by simulation plots of the word error probability for , and systems.",

PyDEC facilitates inquiry into both physical problems on manifolds as well as purely topological problems on abstract complexes. We describe efficient algorithms for constructing the operators and objects that arise in discrete exterior calculus, lowest order finite element exterior calculus and in related topological problems. Our algorithms are formulated in terms of high-level matrix operations which extend to arbitrary dimension. As a result, our implementations map well to the facilities of numerical libraries such as NumPy and SciPy. The availability of such libraries makes Python suitable for prototyping numerical methods.

	{'abstract': u'For an transmit, receive antenna system ( system), a space time block code (STBC) transmits complex symbols per channel use. The well known Golden code is an example of a full-rate, full-diversity STBC for 2 transmit antennas. Its ML-decoding complexity is of the order of for square -QAM. The Silver code for 2 transmit antennas has all the desirable properties of the Golden code except its coding gain, but offers lower ML-decoding complexity of the order of . Importantly, the slight loss in coding gain is negligible compared to the advantage it offers in terms of lowering the ML-decoding complexity. For higher number of transmit antennas, the best known codes are the Perfect codes, which are full-rate, full-diversity, information lossless codes (for ) but have a high ML-decoding complexity of the order of (for , the punctured Perfect codes are considered). In this paper, a scheme to obtain full-rate STBCs for transmit antennas and any with reduced ML-decoding complexity of the order of , is presented. The codes constructed are also information lossless for , like the Perfect codes and allow higher mutual information than the comparable punctured Perfect codes for . These codes are referred to as the , since they enjoy the same desirable properties as the comparable Perfect codes (except possibly the coding gain) with lower ML-decoding complexity, analogous to the Silver-Golden codes for 2 transmit antennas. Simulation results of the symbol error rates for 4 and 8 transmit antennas show that the generalized Silver codes match the punctured Perfect codes in error performance while offering lower ML-decoding complexity.',

	{'abstract': u'The approach of quantifying the damage inflicted on a graph in Albert, Jeong and Barabsi\'s (AJB) report "Error and Attack Tolerance of Complex Networks" using the size of the largest connected component and the average size of the remaining components does not capture our intuitive idea of the damage to a graph caused by disconnections. We evaluate an alternative metric based on average inverse path lengths (AIPLs) that better fits our intuition that a graph can still be reasonably functional even when it is disconnected. We compare our metric with AJB\'s using a test set of graphs and report the differences. AJB\'s report should not be confused with a report by Crucitti et al. with the same name. Based on our analysis of graphs of different sizes and types, and using various numerical and statistical tools; the ratio of the average inverse path lengths of a connected graph of the same size as the sum of the size of the fragments of the disconnected graph can be used as a metric about the damage of a graph by the removal of an edge or a node. This damage is reported in the range (0,1) where 0 means that the removal had no effect on the graph\'s capability to perform its functions. A 1 means that the graph is totally dysfunctional. We exercise our metric on a collection of sample graphs that have been subjected to various attack profiles that focus on edge, node or degree betweenness values. We believe that this metric can be used to quantify the damage done to the graph by an attacker, and that it can be used in evaluating the positive effect of adding additional edges to an existing graph.',

	{'abstract': u'It is well known that the Space-time Block Codes (STBCs) from Complex orthogonal designs (CODs) are single-symbol decodable/symbol-by-symbol decodable (SSD). The weight matrices of the square CODs are all unitary and obtainable from the unitary matrix representations of Clifford Algebras when the number of transmit antennas is a power of 2. The rate of the square CODs for has been shown to be complex symbols per channel use. However, SSD codes having unitary-weight matrices need not be CODs, an example being the Minimum-Decoding-Complexity STBCs from Quasi-Orthogonal Designs. In this paper, an achievable upper bound on the rate of any unitary-weight SSD code is derived to be complex symbols per channel use for antennas, and this upper bound is larger than that of the CODs. By way of code construction, the interrelationship between the weight matrices of unitary-weight SSD codes is studied. Also, the coding gain of all unitary-weight SSD codes is proved to be the same for QAM constellations and conditions that are necessary for unitary-weight SSD codes to achieve full transmit diversity and optimum coding gain are presented.',

	{'abstract': u'English Character Recognition (CR) has been extensively studied in the last half century and progressed to a level, sufficient to produce technology driven applications. But same is not the case for Indian languages which are complicated in terms of structure and computations. Rapidly growing computational power may enable the implementation of Indic CR methodologies. Digital document processing is gaining popularity for application to office and library automation, bank and postal services, publishing houses and communication technology. Devnagari being the national language of India, spoken by more than 500 million people, should be given special attention so that document retrieval and analysis of rich ancient and modern Indian literature can be effectively done. This article is intended to serve as a guide and update for the readers, working in the Devnagari Optical Character Recognition (DOCR) area. An overview of DOCR systems is presented and the available DOCR techniques are reviewed. The current status of DOCR is discussed and directions for future research are suggested.',

	{'abstract': u'This paper introduces a new preconditioning technique that is suitable for matrices arising from the discretization of a system of PDEs on unstructured grids. The preconditioner satisfies a so-called filtering property, which ensures that the input matrix is identical with the preconditioner on a given filtering vector. This vector is chosen to alleviate the effect of low frequency modes on convergence and so decrease or eliminate the plateau which is often observed in the convergence of iterative methods. In particular, the paper presents a general approach that allows to ensure that the filtering condition is satisfied in a matrix decomposition. The input matrix can have an arbitrary sparse structure. Hence, it can be reordered using nested dissection, to allow a parallel computation of the preconditioner and of the iterative process.',

	{'abstract': u'In the earlier version of this paper, it was wrongly claimed that time-sharing is required to achieve the capacity region of the Gaussian interference channel to within one bit, especially at corner points. The flaw in the argument of the earlier version lies in fixing the decoding paradigm for a fixed common/private message splitting encoding strategy. More specifically, the additional constraints (7b) and (7d) in the earlier version arise if we force the common messages to be always decoded at unintended receivers. However, (7b) and (7d) can be eliminated by allowing the decoders to ignore unintended common messages, particularly at corner points of the rate region, without resorting to time-sharing at the transmit side, as suggested in the earlier version. For these reasons, our earlier claim is invalid.',

	{'abstract': u'In this paper we compare the use of several features in the task of content filtering for video social networks, a very challenging task, not only because the unwanted content is related to very high-level semantic concepts (e.g., pornography, violence, etc.) but also because videos from social networks are extremely assorted, preventing the use of constrained a priori information. We propose a simple method, able to combine diverse evidence, coming from different features and various video elements (entire video, shots, frames, keyframes, etc.). We evaluate our method in three social network applications, related to the detection of unwanted content - pornographic videos, violent videos, and videos posted to artificially manipulate popularity scores. Using challenging test databases, we show that this simple scheme is able to obtain good results, provided that adequate features are chosen. Moreover, we establish a representation using codebooks of spatiotemporal local descriptors as critical to the success of the method in all three contexts. This is consequential, since the state-of-the-art still relies heavily on static features for the tasks addressed.',

Based on the SPC mode, two particular algorithms are developed with different tradeoff between PAPR and computational complexity.

	{'abstract': u'Domain decomposition methods are essential in solving applied problems on parallel computer systems. For boundary value problems for evolutionary equations the implicit schemes are in common use to solve problems at a new time level employing iterative methods of domain decomposition. An alternative approach is based on constructing iteration-free methods based on special schemes of splitting into subdomains. Such regionally-additive schemes are constructed using the general theory of additive operator-difference schemes. There are employed the analogues of classical schemes of alternating direction method, locally one-dimensional schemes, factorization methods, vector and regularized additive schemes. The main results were obtained here for time-dependent problems with self-adjoint elliptic operators of second order. The paper discusses the Cauchy problem for the first order evolutionary equations with a nonnegative not self-adjoint operator in a finite-dimensional Hilbert space. Based on the partition of unit, we have constructed the operators of decomposition which preserve nonnegativity for the individual operator terms of splitting. Unconditionally stable additive schemes of domain decomposition were constructed using the regularization principle for operator-difference schemes. Vector additive schemes were considered, too. The results of our work are illustrated by a model problem for the two-dimensional parabolic equation.',

	{'abstract': u'Xampling generalizes compressed sensing (CS) to reduced-rate sampling of analog signals. A unified framework is introduced for low rate sampling and processing of signals lying in a union of subspaces. Xampling consists of two main blocks: Analog compression that narrows down the input bandwidth prior to sampling with commercial devices followed by a nonlinear algorithm that detects the input subspace prior to conventional signal processing. A variety of analog CS applications are reviewed within the unified Xampling framework including a general filter-bank scheme for sparse shift-invariant spaces, periodic nonuniform sampling and modulated wideband conversion for multiband communications with unknown carrier frequencies, acquisition techniques for finite rate of innovation signals with applications to medical and radar imaging, and random demodulation of sparse harmonic tones. A hardware-oriented viewpoint is advocated throughout, addressing practical constraints and exemplifying hardware realizations where relevant. It will appear as a chapter in a book on "Compressed Sensing: Theory and Applications" edited by Yonina Eldar and Gitta Kutyniok.',

A common problem is that representations of items often only consist of mere technical attributes, which do not resemble human perception. This is particularly true for integral items such as movies or songs. It is often claimed that meaningful item features could be extracted from collaborative rating data, which is becoming available through social networking services. However, there is only anecdotal evidence supporting this claim; but if it is true, the extracted information could very valuable for preference-based data retrieval. In this paper, we propose a methodology to systematically check this common claim. We performed a preliminary investigation on a large collection of movie ratings and present initial evidence.',

	{'abstract': u'The limited range in its abscissa of ranked letter frequency distributions causes multiple functions to fit the observed distribution reasonably well. In order to critically compare various functions, we apply the statistical model selections on ten functions, using the texts of U.S. and Mexican presidential speeches in the last 1-2 centuries. Dispite minor switching of ranking order of certain letters during the temporal evolution for both datasets, the letter usage is generally stable. The best fitting function, judged by either least-square-error or by AIC/BIC model selection, is the Cocho/Beta function. We also use a novel method to discover clusters of letters by their observed-over-expected frequency ratios.',

	{'abstract': u"Given a polygon and a visibility range, the Myopic Watchman Problem with Discrete Vision (MWPDV) asks for a closed path P and a set of scan points S, such that (i) every point of the polygon is within visibility range of a scan point; and (ii) path length plus weighted sum of scan number along the tour is minimized. Alternatively, the bicriteria problem (ii') aims at minimizing both scan number and tour length. We consider both lawn mowing (in which tour and scan points may leave P) and milling (in which tour, scan points and visibility must stay within P) variants for the MWPDV; even for simple special cases, these problems are NP-hard. We show that this problem is NP-hard, even for the special cases of rectilinear polygons and L_ infty scan range 1, and negligible small travel cost or negligible travel cost. For rectilinear MWPDV milling in grid polygons we present a 2.5-approximation with unit scan range; this holds for the bicriteria version, thus for any linear combination of travel cost and scan cost. For grid polygons and circular unit scan range, we describe a bicriteria 4-approximation. These results serve as stepping stones for the general case of circular scans with scan radius r and arbitrary polygons of feature size a, for which we extend the underlying ideas to a pi(r/a+(r+1)/2) bicriteria approximation algorithm. Finally, we describe approximation schemes for MWPDV lawn mowing and milling of grid polygons, for fixed ratio between scan cost and travel cost.",

	{'abstract': u'In this paper, our goal is to characterize two graph classes based on the properties of minimal vertex (edge) separators. We first present a structural characterization of graphs in which every minimal vertex separator is a stable set. We show that such graphs are precisely those in which the induced subgraph, namely, a cycle with exactly one chord is forbidden. We also show that deciding maximum such forbidden subgraph is NP-complete by establishing a polynomial time reduction from maximum induced cycle problem [1]. This result is of independent interest and can be used in other combinatorial problems. Secondly, we prove that a graph has the following property: every minimal edge separator induces a matching (that is no two edges share a vertex in common) if and only if it is a tree.',

	{'abstract': u'The main purpose of Feature Subset Selection is to find a reduced subset of attributes from a data set described by a feature set. The task of a feature selection algorithm (FSA) is to provide with a computational solution motivated by a certain definition of relevance or by a reliable evaluation measure. In this paper several fundamental algorithms are studied to assess their performance in a controlled experimental scenario. A measure to evaluate FSAs is devised that computes the degree of matching between the output given by a FSA and the known optimal solutions. An extensive experimental study on synthetic problems is carried out to assess the behaviour of the algorithms in terms of solution accuracy and size as a function of the relevance, irrelevance, redundancy and size of the data samples. The controlled experimental conditions facilitate the derivation of better-supported and meaningful conclusions.',

	{'abstract': u"Sentiment analysis of microblogs such as Twitter has recently gained a fair amount of attention. One of the simplest sentiment analysis approaches compares the words of a posting against a labeled word list, where each word has been scored for valence, -- a 'sentiment lexicon' or 'affective word lists'. There exist several affective word lists, e.g., ANEW (Affective Norms for English Words) developed before the advent of microblogging and sentiment analysis. I wanted to examine how well ANEW and other word lists performs for the detection of sentiment strength in microblog posts in comparison with a new word list specifically constructed for microblogs. I used manually labeled postings from Twitter scored for sentiment. Using a simple word matching I show that the new word list may perform better than ANEW, though not as good as the more elaborate approach found in SentiStrength.",

	{'abstract': u'In multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) spatially multiplexing (SM) systems, achievable error rate performance is determined by signal detection strategy. The optimal maximum-likelihood detection (MLD) that exhaustively examines all symbol candidates has exponential complexity and may not be applicable in many practical systems. In this paper, we consider a generalized minimum mean square error (MMSE) detection derived from conditional mean estimation, which in principle behaves equivalently to MLD but also includes a linear MMSE detection as a special case. Motivated by this fact, we propose a low-complexity detection which significantly reduces the number of examined symbol candidates without significant error rate performance degradation from MLD. Our approach is to approximate the probability density function (pdf) of modulated symbols that appears in the exact conditional mean expression such that the decision metric can be cast into a partially closed form. It is found that uniform ring approximation in combination with phase shift keying (PSK) and amplitude phase shift keying (APSK) is promising, as it can achieve a performance even comparable to MLD, while its complexity is linear when the number of transmit antennas is two.',

	{'abstract': u'Software testing is an expensive process, which is vital in the industry. Construction of the test-data in software testing requires the major cost and to decide which method to use in order to generate the test data is important. This paper discusses the efficiency of search-based algorithms (preferably genetic algorithm) versus random testing, in soft- ware test-data generation. This study di?ers from all previous studies due to sample programs (SUTs) which are used. Since we want to in- crease the complexity of SUTs gradually, and the program generation is automatic as well, Grammatical Evolution is used to guide the program generation. SUTs are generated according to the grammar we provide, with di?erent levels of complexity. SUTs will first undergo genetic al- gorithm and then random testing. Based on the test results, this paper recommends one method to use for automation of software testing.',

In particular, our main result is a theorem that gives simple sufficient conditions for a strategy to be optimum in the exponential moment sense. This theorem may be useful in various situations, and application examples are given. We also examine the asymptotic regime and investigate universal asymptotically optimum strategies in light of the aforementioned sufficient conditions, as well as phenomena of irregularities, or phase transitions, in the behavior of the asymptotic performance, which can be viewed and understood from a statistical-mechanical perspective.

In this correspondence, we analyse the DoF region and sum DoF for unicast layered multi-hop relay wireless networks with arbitrary number of source/destination/relay nodes, arbitrary number of hops and arbitrary number of antennas at each node. The result is valid for quite a few message topologies. We reveal the limitation on capacity of multi-hop network due to the concatenation structure and show the similarity with capacitor network. From the analysis on bound gap and optimality condition, the ultimate capacity of multi-hop network is shown to be strictly inferior to that of single-hop network. Linear scaling law can be established when the number of hops is fixed. At cost of channel state information at transmitters (CSIT) for each component single-hop network, our achievable scheme avoids routing and simplifies scheduling.',

	{'abstract': u"Current work in planning with preferences assume that the user's preference models are completely specified and aim to search for a single solution plan. In many real-world planning scenarios, however, the user probably cannot provide any information about her desired plans, or in some cases can only express partial preferences. In such situations, the planner has to present not only one but a set of plans to the user, with the hope that some of them are similar to the plan she prefers. We first propose the usage of different measures to capture quality of plan sets that are suitable for such scenarios: domain-independent distance measures defined based on plan elements (actions, states, causal links) if no knowledge of the user's preferences is given, and the Integrated Convex Preference measure in case the user's partial preference is provided. We then investigate various heuristic approaches to find set of plans according to these measures, and present empirical results demonstrating the promise of our approach.",

	{'abstract': u'This paper focuses on the convergence of infor- mation in distributed systems of agents communicating over a network. The information on which the convergence is sought is not represented by real numbers, rather by sets of real numbers, whose possible dynamics are given by the class of so-called Boolean maps, involving only unions, intersections, and complements of sets. Based on a notion of contractivity, a necessary and sufficient condition ensuring the global and local convergence toward an equilibrium point is presented. In particular the analysis of global convergence recovers results already obtained by the authors, but the more general approach used in this paper allows analogue results to be found to characterize the local convergence.',

	{'abstract': u'This paper gives two new categorical characterisations of lenses: one as a coalgebra of the store comonad, and the other as a monoidal natural transformation on a category of a certain class of coalgebras. The store comonad of the first characterisation can be generalized to a Cartesian store comonad, and the coalgebras of this Cartesian store comonad turn out to be exactly the Biplates of the Uniplate generic programming library. On the other hand, the monoidal natural transformations on functors can be generalized to work on a category of more specific coalgebras. This generalization turns out to be the type of compos from the Compos generic programming library. A theorem, originally conjectured by van Laarhoven, proves that these two generalizations are isomorphic, thus the core data types of the Uniplate and Compos libraries supporting generic program on single recursive types are the same. Both the Uniplate and Compos libraries generalize this core functionality to support mutually recursive types in different ways. This paper proposes a third extension to support mutually recursive data types that is as powerful as Compos and as easy to use as Uniplate. This proposal, called Multiplate, only requires rank 3 polymorphism in addition to the normal type class mechanism of Haskell.',

	{'abstract': u'This paper addresses the problem of detecting possible intruders in a group of autonomous robots, which coexist in a shared environment and interact with each other according to a set of "social behaviors", or common rules. Such rules specify what actions each robot is allowed to perform in the pursuit of its individual goals: rules are distributed, i.e. they can evaluated based only on the state of the individual robot, and on information that can be sensed directly or through communication with immediate neighbors. We consider intruders as robots which misbehave, i.e. do not follow the rules, because of either spontaneous failures or malicious reprogramming. Our goal is to detect intruders by observing the congruence of their behavior with the social rules as applied to the current state of the overall system. Moreover, in accordance with the fully distributed nature of the problem, the detection itself must be peformed by individual robots, based only on local information. The paper introduces a formalism that allows to model uniformly a large variety of possible robot societies. The main contribution consists in the proposal of an Intrusion Detection System, i.e. a protocol that, under suitabkle conditions, allows individual robots to detect possible misbehaving robots in their vicinity, and trigger possible further actions to secure the society. It is worth noting that the generality of the protocol formalism makes so that local monitors can be automatically generated once the cooperation rules and the robot dynamics are specified. The effectiveness of the proposed technique is shown through application to examples of automated robotic systems.',

	{'abstract': u'In this paper we introduce a novel consensus mech- anism where agents of a network are able to share logical values, or Booleans, representing their local opinions on e.g. the presence of an intruder or of a fire within an indoor environment. We first formulate the logical consensus problem, and then we review relevant results in the literature on cellular automata and convergence of finite-state iteration maps. Under suitable joint conditions on the visibility of agents and their communication capability, we provide an algorithm for generating a logical linear consensus system that is globally stable. The solution is optimal in terms of the number of messages to be exchanged and the time needed to reach a consensus. Moreover, to cope with possible sensor failure, we propose a second design approach that produces robust logical nonlinear consensus systems tolerating a given maximum number of faults. Finally, we show applicability of the agreement mechanism to a case study consisting of a distributed Intrusion Detection System (IDS).',

	{'abstract': u'This paper describes two applications of conditional restricted Boltzmann machines (CRBMs) to the task of autotagging music. The first consists of training a CRBM to predict tags that a user would apply to a clip of a song based on tags already applied by other users. By learning the relationships between tags, this model is able to pre-process training data to significantly improve the performance of a support vector machine (SVM) autotagging. The second is the use of a discriminative RBM, a type of CRBM, to autotag music. By simultaneously exploiting the relationships among tags and between tags and audio-based features, this model is able to significantly outperform SVMs, logistic regression, and multi-layer perceptrons. In order to be applied to this problem, the discriminative RBM was generalized to the multi-label setting and four different learning algorithms for it were evaluated, the first such in-depth analysis of which we are aware.',

The proposed algorithm is based on a shared resources protocol and a replanning strategy. It is proved to guarantee ordered traffic flows avoiding collisions, deadlocks (stall situations) and livelock (agents move without reaching final destinations). Mutual access to resources has been proved for the proposed approach while condition on the maximum number of AGVs is given to ensure the absence of deadlocks during system evolutions. Finally conditions to verify a local livelocks will also be proposed. In consistency with the model of distributed robotic systems (DRS), no centralized mechanism, synchronized clock, shared memory or ground support is needed. A local inter-robot communication, based on sign-boards, is considered among a small number of spatially adjacent robotic units.',

	{'abstract': u'Graphical calculi for representing interacting quantum systems serve a number of purposes: compositionally, intuitive graphical reasoning, and a logical underpinning for automation. The power of these calculi stems from the fact that they embody generalized symmetries of the structure of quantum operations, which, for example, stretch well beyond the Choi-Jamiolkowski isomorphism. One such calculus takes the GHZ and W states as its basic generators. Here we show that this language allows one to encode standard rational calculus, with the GHZ state as multiplication, the W state as addition, the Pauli X gate as multiplicative inversion, and the Pauli Z gate as additive inversion.',

	{'abstract': u"In this article we address the problem of catching objects that move at a relatively large distance from the robot, of the order of tens of times the size of the robot itself. To this purpose, we adopt casting manipulation and visual-based feedback control. Casting manipulation is a technique to deploy a robotic end-effector far from the robot's base, by throwing the end-effector and controlling its ballistic flight using forces transmitted through a light tether connected to the end-effector itself. The tether cable can then be used to retrieve the end- effector to exert forces on the robot's environment. In previous work, planar casting manipulation was demon- strated to aptly catch static objects placed at a distant, known position, thus proving it suitable for applications such as sample acquisition and return, rescue, etc. In this paper we propose an extension of the idea to controlling the position of the end- effector to reach moving targets in 3D. The goal is achieved by an innovative design of the casting mechanism, and by closing a real-time control loop on casting manipulation using visual feedback of moving targets. To achieve this result, simplified yet accurate models of the system suitable for real-time computation are developed, along with a suitable visual feedback scheme for the flight phase. Effectiveness of the visual feedback controller is demonstrated through experiments with a 2D casting robot.",

The proposed FSE accomplishes a scalable tradeoff between performance and complexity. Also, because it has a parallel tree-search structure, the proposed encoder can be easily pipelined, leading to a tremendous reduction in the precoding latency. The complexity of the proposed encoder is also analyzed, and we propose two techniques that reduce it. Simulation and analytical results demonstrate that in a 4 by 4 MU-MIMO system, the proposed FSE requires only 11.5% of the computational complexity needed by the conventional QRD-M encoder (QRDM-E). Also, the encoding throughput of the proposed encoder is 7.5 times that of the QRDM-E with tolerable degradation in the BER performance, while achieving the optimum diversity order.',

	{'abstract': u'In this paper we review our current results concerning the computational power of quantum read-once branching programs. First of all, based on the circuit presentation of quantum branching programs and our variant of quantum fingerprinting technique, we show that any Boolean function with linear polynomial presentation can be computed by a quantum read-once branching program using a relatively small (usually logarithmic in the size of input) number of qubits. Then we show that the described class of Boolean functions is closed under the polynomial projections.',

	{'abstract': u'We present a version of the Bloom filter data structure that supports not only the insertion, deletion, and lookup of key-value pairs, but also allows a complete listing of its contents with high probability, as long the number of key-value pairs is below a designed threshold. Our structure allows the number of key-value pairs to greatly exceed this threshold during normal operation. Exceeding the threshold simply temporarily prevents content listing and reduces the probability of a successful lookup. If later entries are deleted to return the structure below the threshold, everything again functions appropriately. We also show that simple variations of our structure are robust to certain standard errors, such as the deletion of a key without a corresponding insertion or the insertion of two distinct values for a key. The properties of our structure make it suitable for several applications, including database and networking applications that we highlight.',

	{'abstract': u"In this paper, we generalize Spencer's hyperbolic cosine algorithm to the matrix-valued setting. We apply the proposed algorithm to several problems by analyzing its computational efficiency under two special cases of matrices; one in which the matrices have a group structure and an other in which they have rank-one. As an application of the former case, we present a deterministic algorithm that, given the multiplication table of a finite group of size , it constructs an expanding Cayley graph of logarithmic degree in near-optimal O(n^2 log^3 n) time. For the latter case, we present a fast deterministic algorithm for spectral sparsification of positive semi-definite matrices, which implies an improved deterministic algorithm for spectral graph sparsification of dense graphs. In addition, we give an elementary connection between spectral sparsification of positive semi-definite matrices and element-wise matrix sparsification. As a consequence, we obtain improved element-wise sparsification algorithms for diagonally dominant-like matrices.",

The model adopts new continuous-valued logic and works in a way very similar to the way a 3-8 decoder in a numerical circuit works. By the decoding model, Young and Helmholtz's tri-pigment theory and Hering's opponent theory are unified more naturally; opponent process, color evolution, and color blindness are illustrated more concisely. According to the decoding model, we can obtain a transform from RGB system to HSV system, which is formally identical to the popular transform for computer graphics provided by Smith (1978).

	{'abstract': u"Visual reranking is effective to improve the performance of the text-based video search. However, existing reranking algorithms can only achieve limited improvement because of the well-known semantic gap between low level visual features and high level semantic concepts. In this paper, we adopt interactive video search reranking to bridge the semantic gap by introducing user's labeling effort. We propose a novel dimension reduction tool, termed sparse transfer learning (STL), to effectively and efficiently encode user's labeling information. STL is particularly designed for interactive video search reranking. Technically, it a) considers the pair-wise discriminative information to maximally separate labeled query relevant samples from labeled query irrelevant ones, b) achieves a sparse representation for the subspace to encodes user's intention by applying the elastic net penalty, and c) propagates user's labeling information from labeled samples to unlabeled samples by using the data distribution knowledge. We conducted extensive experiments on the TRECVID 2005, 2006 and 2007 benchmark datasets and compared STL with popular dimension reduction algorithms. We report superior performance by using the proposed STL based interactive video search reranking.",

The work involved takes some patience and has three stages to go through. At the final stage the "alchemist" in the mirror wearing sharp-colored gloves (for motion tracking) is to extract the final ultimate shining sparkle (FFT-based visualization) in the nexus of the hands. The more the hands are apart, the large the sparkle should be. Moving hands around should make the sparkle follow. To achieve the desired visual effect and the feedback mechanism, the Jitter lattice-based intensional programming model is used to work on 4-dimensional (A+R+G+B) video matrices and sound signals in order to apply some well-known alchemical techniques to the video at real-time to get a mirror effect and accompanying transmutation and transformation stages of the video based on the stability of the sound produced for some duration of time in real-time. There is an accompanying video of the result with the interaction with the tool and the corresponding programming patches.',

The main objective of this paper is to show that this conflicting situation (modeled by a non-cooperative game) has some stable outcomes, namely Nash equilibria. This result is proved for three different types of relaying protocols: decode-and-forward, estimate-and-forward, and amplify-and-forward. We provide additional results on the problems of uniqueness, efficiency of the equilibrium, and convergence of a best-response based dynamics to the equilibrium. These issues are analyzed in a special case of the amplify-and-forward protocol and illustrated by simulations in general.',

	{'abstract': u'We analyze the asymptotic behavior of compute-and-forward relay networks in the regime of high signal-to-noise ratios. We consider a section of such a network consisting of K transmitters and K relays. The aim of the relays is to reliably decode an invertible function of the messages sent by the transmitters. An upper bound on the capacity of this system can be obtained by allowing full cooperation among the transmitters and among the relays, transforming the network into a K times K multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channel. The number of degrees of freedom of compute-and-forward is hence at most K. In this paper, we analyze the degrees of freedom achieved by the lattice coding implementation of compute-and-forward proposed recently by Nazer and Gastpar. We show that this lattice implementation achieves at most 2/(1+1/K) leq 2 degrees of freedom, thus exhibiting a very different asymptotic behavior than the MIMO upper bound. This raises the question if this gap of the lattice implementation to the MIMO upper bound is inherent to compute-and-forward in general. We answer this question in the negative by proposing a novel compute-and-forward implementation achieving K degrees of freedom.',

	{'abstract': u"PPAD refers to a class of computational problems for which solutions are guaranteed to exist due to a specific combinatorial principle. The most well-known such problem is that of computing a Nash equilibrium of a game. Other examples include the search for market equilibria, and envy-free allocations in the context of cake-cutting. A problem is said to be complete for PPAD if it belongs to PPAD and can be shown to constitute one of the hardest computational challenges within that class. In this paper, I give a relatively informal overview of the proofs used in the PPAD-completeness results. The focus is on the mixed Nash equilibria guaranteed to exist by Nash's theorem. I also give an overview of some recent work that uses these ideas to show PSPACE-completeness for the computation of specific equilibria found by homotopy methods. I give a brief introduction to related problems of searching for market equilibria.",

	{'abstract': u'Circulant matrices play a central role in a recently proposed formulation of three-way data computations. In this setting, a three-way table corresponds to a matrix where each "scalar" is a vector of parameters defining a circulant. This interpretation provides many generalizations of results from matrix or vector-space algebra. We derive the power and Arnoldi methods in this algebra. In the course of our derivation, we define inner products, norms, and other notions. These extensions are straightforward in an algebraic sense, but the implications are dramatically different from the standard matrix case. For example, a matrix of circulants has a polynomial number of eigenvalues in its dimension; although, these can all be represented by a carefully chosen canonical set of eigenvalues and vectors. These results and algorithms are closely related to standard decoupling techniques on block-circulant matrices using the fast Fourier transform.',

	{'abstract': u'Based on the extended binary image of non-binary LDPC codes, we propose a method for generating extra redundant bits, such as to decreases the coding rate of a mother code. The proposed method allows for using the same decoder, regardless of how many extra redundant bits have been produced, which considerably increases the flexibility of the system without significantly increasing its complexity. Extended codes are also optimized for the binary erasure channel, by using density evolution methods. Nevertheless, the results presented in this paper can easily be extrapolated to more general channel models.',

	{'abstract': u'The Progressive Edge Growth (PEG) algorithm is one of the most widely-used method for constructing finite length LDPC codes. In this paper we consider the PEG algorithm together with a scheduling distribution, which specifies the order in which edges are established in the graph. The goal is to find a scheduling distribution that yields "the best" performance in terms of decoding overhead, performance metric specific to erasure codes and widely used for upper-layer forward error correction (UL-FEC). We rigorously formulate this optimization problem, and we show that it can be addressed by using genetic optimization algorithms. We also exhibit PEG codes with optimized scheduling distribution, whose decoding overhead is less than half of the decoding overhead of their classical-PEG counterparts.',

	{'abstract': u'Distributed storage infrastructures require the use of data redundancy to achieve high data reliability. Unfortunately, the use of redundancy introduces storage and communication overheads, which can either reduce the overall storage capacity of the system or increase its costs. To mitigate the storage and communication overhead, different redundancy schemes have been proposed. However, due to the great variety of underlaying storage infrastructures and the different application needs, optimizing these redundancy schemes for each storage infrastructure is cumbersome. The lack of rules to determine the optimal level of redundancy for each storage configuration leads developers in industry to often choose simpler redundancy schemes, which are usually not the optimal ones. In this paper we analyze the cost of different redundancy schemes and derive a set of rules to determine which redundancy scheme minimizes the storage and the communication costs for a given system configuration. Additionally, we use simulation to show that theoretically-optimal schemes may not be viable in a realistic setting where nodes can go off-line and repairs may be delayed. In these cases, we identify which are the trade-offs between the storage and communication overheads of the redundancy scheme and its data reliability.',

	{'abstract': u'Objective-The main purpose of this paper is to construct a distributed clustering algorithm such that each distributed cluster can perform the data accuracy at their respective cluster head node before data aggregation and transmit the data to the sink node. Design approach/Procedure - We investigate that the data are spatially correlated among the sensor nodes which form the clusters in the spatial domain. Due to high correlation of data, these clusters of sensor nodes are overlapped in the spatial domain. To overcome this problem, we construct a distributed clustering algorithm with non-overlapping irregular clusters in the spatial domain. Then each distributed cluster can perform data accuracy at the cluster head node and finally send the data to the sink node. Findings- Simulation result shows the associate sensor nodes of each distributed cluster and clarifies their data accuracy profile in the spatial domain. We demonstrate the simulation results for a single cluster to verify that their exist an optimal cluster which give approximately the same data accuracy level achieve by the single cluster. Moreover we find that as the distance from the tracing point to the number of sensor node increases the data accuracy decreases. Design Limitations - This model is only applicable to estimate data accuracy for distributed clusters where the sensed data are assumed to be spatially correlated with approximately same variations. Practical implementation - Measure the moisture content in the distributed agricultural field. Inventive/Novel idea- This is the first time that a data accuracy model is performed for the distributed clusters before data aggregation at the cluster head node which can reduce data redundancy and communication overhead.',

	{'abstract': u'Keyword search in relational databases has been widely studied in recent years because it does not require users neither to master a certain structured query language nor to know the complex underlying data schemas. Most of existing methods focus on answering snapshot keyword queries in static databases. In practice, however, databases are updated frequently, and users may have long-term interests on specific topics. To deal with such a situation, it is necessary to build effective and efficient facility in database systems to support continual keyword queries evaluation. In this paper, we propose an efficient method for continual keyword queries answering over relational databases. The proposed method consists of two core algorithms. The first one computes a set of potential top- results by evaluating the ranges of the future relevance score for every query result and create a light-weight state for each keyword query. The second one uses these states to maintain the top- results of keyword queries when the database is continually growing. Experimental results validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method.',

We determine the minimal set of sensor nodes that are sufficient to give approximately the same data accuracy achieve by the maximal set of sensor nodes. Design approach/Procedure-L set of sensor nodes are randomly deployed over a region Z. Since a point event S has occurred in the region Z, M maximal set of sensor nodes wake up and start sensing the point event. The set of M sensor nodes forms a cluster with fully connected network and remaining set of sensor nodes continue to be in sleep mode. One sensor node is elected randomly as a cluster head (CH) node which can estimate the data accuracy for the cluster before data aggregation and finally send the data to the sink node. Findings - Since we simulate the data accuracy for the cluster (M set of sensor nodes) at CH node, there exist P minimal set of sensor nodes which give approximately the same data accuracy level achieve by M set of sensor nodes .Moreover we find that as the distance from the point event to the number of sensor nodes increases, the data accuracy also get decreases.

	{'abstract': u'We examine the combination of two directions in the field of privacy concerning computations over distributed private inputs - secure function evaluation (SFE) and differential privacy. While in both the goal is to privately evaluate some function of the individual inputs, the privacy requirements are significantly different. The general feasibility results for SFE suggest a natural paradigm for implementing differentially private analyses distributively: First choose what to compute, i.e., a differentially private analysis; Then decide how to compute it, i.e., construct an SFE protocol for this analysis. We initiate an examination whether there are advantages to a paradigm where both decisions are made simultaneously. In particular, we investigate under which accuracy requirements it is beneficial to adapt this paradigm for computing a collection of functions including binary sum, gap threshold, and approximate median queries. Our results imply that when computing the binary sum of distributed inputs then: * When we require that the error is and the number of rounds is constant, there is no benefit in the new paradigm. * When we allow an error of , the new paradigm yields more efficient protocols when we consider protocols that compute symmetric functions. Our results also yield new separations between the local and global models of computations for private data analysis.',

	{'abstract': u'This paper presents two new results on multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) Gaussian broadcast channels with confidential messages. First, the problem of the MIMO Gaussian wiretap channel is revisited. A matrix characterization of the capacity-equivocation region is provided, which extends the previous result on the secrecy capacity of the MIMO Gaussian wiretap channel to the general, possibly imperfect secrecy setting. Next, the problem of MIMO Gaussian broadcast channels with two receivers and three independent messages: a common message intended for both receivers, and two confidential messages each intended for one of the receivers but needing to be kept asymptotically perfectly secret from the other, is considered. A precise characterization of the capacity region is provided, generalizing the previous results which considered only two out of three possible messages.',

Exploiting this idea, we propose an index for a packed string, based on a cite with appropriately defined suffix links.

	{'abstract': u'A natural way for cooperative tasking in multi-agent systems is through a top-down design by decomposing a global task into sub-tasks for each individual agent such that the accomplishments of these sub-tasks will guarantee the achievement of the global task. In our previous works [1], [2] we presented necessary and sufficient conditions on the decomposability of a global task automaton between cooperative agents. As a follow-up work, this paper deals with the robustness issues of the proposed top-down design approach with respect to event failures in the multi-agent systems. The main concern under event failure is whether a previously decomposable task can still be achieved collectively by the agents, and if not, we would like to investigate that under what conditions the global task could be robustly accomplished. This is actually the fault-tolerance issue of the top-down design, and the results provide designers with hints on which events are fragile with respect to failures, and whether redundancies are needed. The main objective of this paper is to identify necessary and sufficient conditions on failed events under which a decomposable global task can still be achieved successfully. For such a purpose, a notion called passivity is introduced to characterize the type of event failures. The passivity is found to reflect the redundancy of communication links over shared events, based on which necessary and sufficient conditions for the reliability of cooperative tasking under event failures are derived, followed by illustrative examples and remarks for the derived conditions.',

	{'abstract': u'In this paper, we propose an approach to controller synthesis for a class of constrained nonlinear systems. It is based on the use of a hybridization, that is a hybrid abstraction of the nonlinear dynamics. This abstraction is defined on a triangulation of the state-space where on each simplex of the triangulation, the nonlinear dynamics is conservatively approximated by an affine system subject to disturbances. Except for the disturbances, this hybridization can be seen as a piecewise affine hybrid system on simplices for which appealing control synthesis techniques have been developed in the past decade. We extend these techniques to handle systems subject to disturbances by synthesizing and coordinating local robust affine controllers defined on the simplices of the triangulation. We show that the resulting hybrid controller can be used to control successfully the original constrained nonlinear system. Our approach, though conservative, can be fully automated and is computationally tractable. To show its effectiveness in practical applications, we apply our method to control a pendulum mounted on a cart.',

	{'abstract': u'In our previous work [1], a divide-and-conquer approach was proposed for cooperative tasking among multi-agent systems. The basic idea is to decompose a requested global specification into subtasks for individual agents such that the fulfillment of these subtasks by each individual agent leads to the satisfaction of the global specification as a team. It was shown that not all tasks can be decomposed. Furthermore, a necessary and sufficient condition was proposed for the decomposability of a task automaton between two cooperative agents. The current paper continues the results in [1] and proposes necessary and sufficient conditions for task decomposability with respect to arbitrary finite number of agents. It is further shown that the fulfillment of local specifications can guarantee the satisfaction of the global specification. This work provides hints for the designers on how to rule out the indecomposable task automata and enforce the decomposability conditions. The result therefore may pave the way towards a new perspective for decentralized cooperative control of multi-agent systems.',

	{'abstract': u'A new approach for the approximation of the channel log-likelihood ratio (LLR) for wireless channels based on Taylor series is proposed. The approximation is applied to the uncorrelated flat Rayleigh fading channel with unknown channel state information at the receiver. It is shown that the proposed approximation greatly simplifies the calculation of channel LLRs, and yet provides results almost identical to those based on the exact calculation of channel LLRs. The results are obtained in the context of bit-interleaved coded modulation (BICM) schemes with low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes, and include threshold calculations and error rate performance of finite-length codes. Compared to the existing approximations, the proposed method is either significantly less complex, or considerably more accurate.',

	{'abstract': u'This paper studies the "explanation problem" for tree- and linearly-ordered array data, a problem motivated by database applications and recently solved for the one-dimensional tree-ordered case. In this paper, one is given a matrix A whose rows and columns have semantics: special subsets of the rows and special subsets of the columns are meaningful, others are not. A submatrix in A is said to be meaningful if and only if it is the cross product of a meaningful row subset and a meaningful column subset, in which case we call it an "allowed rectangle." The goal is to "explain" A as a sparse sum of weighted allowed rectangles. Specifically, we wish to find as few weighted allowed rectangles as possible such that, for all i,j, a_ equals the sum of the weights of all rectangles which include cell (i,j). In this paper we consider the natural cases in which the matrix dimensions are tree-ordered or linearly-ordered. In the tree-ordered case, we are given a rooted tree T1 whose leaves are the rows of A and another, T2, whose leaves are the columns. Nodes of the trees correspond in an obvious way to the sets of their leaf descendants. In the linearly-ordered case, a set of rows or columns is meaningful if and only if it is contiguous. For tree-ordered data, we prove the explanation problem NP-Hard and give a randomized 2-approximation algorithm for it. For linearly-ordered data, we prove the explanation problem NP-Hard and give a 2.56-approximation algorithm. To our knowledge, these are the first results for the problem of sparsely and exactly representing matrices by weighted rectangles.',

It acts as a framework for building customized applications and deploying them on either public or private Clouds. One of the key features of Aneka is its support for provisioning resources on different public Cloud providers such as Amazon EC2, Windows Azure and GoGrid. In this chapter, we will present Aneka platform and its integration with one of the public Cloud infrastructures, Windows Azure, which enables the usage of Windows Azure Compute Service as a resource provider of Aneka PaaS. The integration of the two platforms will allow users to leverage the power of Windows Azure Platform for Aneka Cloud Computing, employing a large number of compute instances to run their applications in parallel. Furthermore, customers of the Windows Azure platform can benefit from the integration with Aneka PaaS by embracing the advanced features of Aneka in terms of multiple programming models, scheduling and management services, application execution services, accounting and pricing services and dynamic provisioning services. Finally, in addition to the Windows Azure Platform we will illustrate in this chapter the integration of Aneka PaaS with other public Cloud platforms such as Amazon EC2 and GoGrid, and virtual machine management platforms such as Xen Server. The new support of provisioning resources on Windows Azure once again proves the adaptability, extensibility and flexibility of Aneka.',

	{'abstract': u'Kautz and de Bruijn graphs have a high degree of connectivity which makes them ideal candidates for massively parallel computer network topologies. In order to realize a practical computer architecture based on these graphs, it is useful to have a means of constructing a large-scale system from smaller, simpler modules. In this paper we consider the mathematical problem of uniformly tiling a de Bruijn or Kautz graph. This can be viewed as a generalization of the graph bisection problem. We focus on the problem of graph tilings by a set of identical subgraphs. Tiles should contain a maximal number of internal edges so as to minimize the number of edges connecting distinct tiles. We find necessary and sufficient conditions for the construction of tilings. We derive a simple lower bound on the number of edges which must leave each tile, and construct a class of tilings whose number of edges leaving each tile agrees asymptotically in form with the lower bound to within a constant factor. These tilings make possible the construction of large-scale computing systems based on de Bruijn and Kautz graph topologies.',

	{'abstract': u'This paper considers the cognitive interference channel (CIC) with two transmitters and two receivers, in which the cognitive transmitter non-causally knows the message and codeword of the primary transmitter. We first introduce a discrete memoryless more capable CIC, which is an extension to the more capable broadcast channel (BC). Using superposition coding, we propose an inner bound and an outer bound on its capacity region. The outer bound is also valid when the primary user is under strong interference. For the Gaussian CIC, this outer bound applies for , where is the gain of interference link from secondary user to primary receiver. These capacity inner and outer bounds are then applied to the Gaussian cognitive Z-interference channel (GCZIC) where only the primary receiver suffers interference. Upon showing that jointly Gaussian input maximizes these bounds for the GCZIC, we evaluate the bounds for this channel. The new outer bound is strictly tighter than other outer bounds on the capacity of the GCZIC at strong interference (). Especially, the outer bound coincides with the inner bound for and thus, establishes the capacity of the GCZIC at this range. For such a large , superposition encoding at the cognitive transmitter and successive decoding at the primary receiver are capacity-achieving.',

	{'abstract': u'The price of anarchy (PoA) has been widely used in static games to quantify the loss of efficiency due to noncooperation. Here, we extend this concept to a general differential games framework. In addition, we introduce the price of information (PoI) to characterize comparative game performances under different information structures, as well as the price of cooperation to capture the extent of benefit or loss a player accrues as a result of altruistic behavior. We further characterize PoA and PoI for a class of scalar linear quadratic differential games under open-loop and closed-loop feedback information structures. We also obtain some explicit bounds on these indices in a large population regime.',

	{'abstract': u'We report here that channel power gain and Root-Mean-Square Delay Spread (RMS-DS) in Low/Medium Voltage power line channels are negatively correlated lognormal random variables. Further analysis of other wireline channels allows us to report a strong similarity between some properties observed in power line channels and the ones observed in other wireline channels, e.g. coaxial cables and phone lines. For example, it is here reported that channel power gain and logarithm of the RMS-DS in DSL links are textit correlated random variables. Exploiting these results, we here propose a statistical wireline channel model where tap amplitudes and delays are generated in order to reflect these physical properties. Although wireline channels are considered deterministic as their impulse response can be readily calculated once the link topology is known, a statistical wireline channel model is useful because the variability of link topologies and wiring practices give rise to a stochastic aspect of wireline communications that has not been well characterized in the literature. Finally, we also point out that alternative channel models that normalize impulse responses to a common (often unitary) power gain may be misleading when assessing the performance of equalization schemes since this normalization artificially removes the correlation between channel power gain and RMS-DS and, thus, Inter-Symbol Interference (ISI).',

This study is motivated by a goal of ultimately putting the MapReduce framework on an equal theoretical footing with the well-known PRAM and BSP parallel models, which would benefit both the theory and practice of MapReduce algorithms. We describe efficient MapReduce algorithms for sorting, multi-searching, and simulations of parallel algorithms specified in the BSP and CRCW PRAM models. We also provide some applications of these results to problems in parallel computational geometry for the MapReduce framework, which result in efficient MapReduce algorithms for sorting, 2- and 3-dimensional convex hulls, and fixed-dimensional linear programming. For the case when mappers and reducers have a memory/message-I/O size of , for a small constant , all of our MapReduce algorithms for these applications run in a constant number of rounds.',

	{'abstract': u'Full-rate STBC (space-time block codes) with non-vanishing determinants achieve the optimal diversity-multiplexing tradeoff but incur high decoding complexity. To permit fast decoding, Sezginer, Sari and Biglieri proposed an STBC structure with special QR decomposition characteristics. In this paper, we adopt a simplified form of this fast-decodable code structure and present a new way to optimize the code analytically. We show that the signal constellation topology (such as QAM, APSK, or PSK) has a critical impact on the existence of non-vanishing determinants of the full-rate STBC. In particular, we show for the first time that, in order for APSK-STBC to achieve non-vanishing determinant, an APSK constellation topology with constellation points lying on square grid and ring radius needs to be used. For signal constellations with vanishing determinants, we present a methodology to analytically optimize the full-rate STBC at specific constellation dimension.',

	{'abstract': u'The generalized degrees of freedom (GDoF) region of the MIMO Gaussian interference channel (IC) is obtained for the general case of an arbitrary number of antennas at each node and where the signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) and interference-to-noise ratios (INR) vary with arbitrary exponents to a nominal SNR. The GDoF region reveals various insights through the joint dependence of optimal interference management techniques (at high SNR) on the SNR exponents that determine the relative strengths of direct-link SNRs and cross-link INRs and the numbers of antennas at the four terminals. For instance, it permits an in-depth look at the issue of rate-splitting and partial decoding and it reveals that, unlike in the scalar IC, treating interference as noise is not always GDoF-optimal even in the very weak interference regime. Moreover, while the DoF-optimal strategy that relies just on transmit/receive zero-forcing beamforming and time-sharing is not GDoF optimal (and thus has an unbounded gap to capacity), the precise characterization of the very strong interference regime -- where single-user DoF performance can be achieved simultaneously for both users-- depends on the relative numbers of antennas at the four terminals and thus deviates from what it is in the SISO case. For asymmetric numbers of antennas at the four nodes the shape of the symmetric GDoF curve can be a "distorted W" curve to the extent that for certain MIMO ICs it is a "V" curve.',

Given a non-deterministic automaton with states, our construction gives a DPW with at most states and parity indices. The corresponding bounds when the original automaton is deterministic are O(n!) and O(n), respectively. Our algorithm gives better asymptotic bounds on the number of states and parity indices vis-a-vis the best known technique when determinizing Rabin or Streett automata with acceptance pairs, where . We demonstrate this by describing a family of Streett (and Rabin) automata with non-redundant acceptance pairs, for which the best known determinization technique gives a DPW with at least states, while our construction constructs a DRW/DPW with states.

	{'abstract': u'In 1997, Z.Zhang and R.W.Yeung found the first example of a conditional information inequality in four variables that is not "Shannon-type". This linear inequality for entropies is called conditional (or constraint) since it holds only under condition that some linear equations are satisfied for the involved entropies. Later, the same authors and other researchers discovered several unconditional information inequalities that do not follow from Shannon\'s inequalities for entropy. In this paper we show that some non Shannon-type conditional inequalities are "essentially" conditional, i.e., they cannot be extended to any unconditional inequality. We prove one new essentially conditional information inequality for Shannon\'s entropy and discuss conditional information inequalities for Kolmogorov complexity.',

	{'abstract': u"In recent times, many protocols have been proposed to provide security for various information and communication systems. Such protocols must be tested for their functional correctness before they are used in practice. Application of formal methods for verification of security protocols would enhance their reliability thereby, increasing the usability of systems that employ them. Thus, formal verification of security protocols has become a key issue in computer and communications security. In this paper we present, analyze and compare some prevalent approaches towards verification of secure systems. We follow the notion of - same goal through different approaches - as we formally analyze the Needham Schroeder Public Key protocol for Lowe's attack using each of our presented approaches.",

The goal: authorized groups of participants should be able to reconstruct the secret but forbidden ones get no information about it. In this paper we introduce several notions of non- perfect secret sharing, where some small information leak is permitted. We study its relation to the Kolmogorov complexity version of secret sharing (establishing some connection in both directions) and the effects of changing the secret size (showing that we can decrease the size of the secret and the information leak at the same time).',

	{'abstract': u'We consider a task of scheduling with a common deadline on a single machine. Every player reports to a scheduler the length of his job and the scheduler needs to finish as many jobs as possible by the deadline. For this simple problem, there is a truthful mechanism that achieves maximum welfare in dominant strategies. The new aspect of our work is that in our setting players are uncertain about their own job lengths, and hence are incapable of providing truthful reports (in the strict sense of the word). For a probabilistic model for uncertainty our main results are as follows. 1) Even with relatively little uncertainty, no mechanism can guarantee a constant fraction of the maximum welfare. 2) To remedy this situation, we introduce a new measure of economic efficiency, based on a notion of a of a player, and design mechanisms that are -fair. In addition to its intrinsic appeal, our notion of fairness implies good approximation of maximum welfare in several cases of interest. 3) In our mechanisms the machine is sometimes left idle even though there are jobs that want to use it. We show that this unfavorable aspect is unavoidable, unless one gives up other favorable aspects (e.g., give up -fairness). We also consider a qualitative approach to uncertainty as an alternative to the probabilistic quantitative model. In the qualitative approach we break away from solution concepts such as dominant strategies (they are no longer well defined), and instead suggest an axiomatic approach, which amounts to listing desirable properties for mechanisms. We provide a mechanism that satisfies these properties.',

	{'abstract': u'Resource coordination and interference management is the key to achieving the benefits of femtocell networks. Over-the-air signaling is one of the most effective means for distributed dynamic resource coordination and interference management. However, the design of this type of signal is challenging. In this letter, we address the challenges and propose an effective solution, referred to as coded single-tone signaling (STS). The proposed coded STS scheme possesses certain highly desirable properties, such as no dedicated resource requirement (no overhead), no near-and-far effect, no inter-signal interference (no multi-user interference), low peak-to-average power ratio (deep coverage). In addition, the proposed coded STS can fully exploit frequency diversity and provides a means for high quality wideband channel estimation. The coded STS design is demonstrated through a concrete numerical example. Performance of the proposed coded STS is evaluated through simulations.',

	{'abstract': u'Linear temporal logic was introduced in order to reason about reactive systems. It is often considered with respect to infinite words, to specify the behaviour of long-running systems. One can consider more general models for linear time, using words indexed by arbitrary linear orderings. We investigate the connections between temporal logic and automata on linear orderings, as introduced by Bruy `ere and Carton. We provide a doubly exponential procedure to compute from any LTL formula with Until, Since, and the Stavi connectives an automaton that decides whether that formula holds on the input word. In particular, since the emptiness problem for these automata is decidable, this transformation gives a decision procedure for the satisfiability of the logic.',

	{'abstract': u'The class of omega-regular languages provides a robust specification language in verification. Every omega-regular condition can be decomposed into a safety part and a liveness part. The liveness part ensures that something good happens "eventually". Finitary liveness was proposed by Alur and Henzinger as a stronger formulation of liveness. It requires that there exists an unknown, fixed bound b such that something good happens within b transitions. In this work we consider automata with finitary acceptance conditions defined by finitary Buchi, parity and Streett languages. We study languages expressible by such automata: we give their topological complexity and present a regular-expression characterization. We compare the expressive power of finitary automata and give optimal algorithms for classical decisions questions. We show that the finitary languages are Sigma 2-complete; we present a complete picture of the expressive power of various classes of automata with finitary and infinitary acceptance conditions; we show that the languages defined by finitary parity automata exactly characterize the star-free fragment of omega B-regular languages; and we show that emptiness is NLOGSPACE-complete and universality as well as language inclusion are PSPACE-complete for finitary parity and Streett automata.',

In addition, we examine correlated equilibrium for the single-receiver model. Correlated strategies are based on signaling structures before making decisions on rates. We then focus on evolutionary games for hybrid additive white Gaussian noise multiple access channel with multiple users and multiple receivers, where each user chooses a rate and splits it over the receivers. Users have coupled constraints determined by the capacity regions. Building upon the static game, we formulate a system of hybrid evolutionary game dynamics using G-function dynamics and Smith dynamics on rate control and channel selection, respectively. We show that the evolving game has an equilibrium and illustrate these dynamics with numerical examples.',

The exact problem has previously been proven intractable even upon single processors; sufficient conditions are presented here for determining whether a given periodic task system will meet all deadlines if scheduled non-preemptively upon a multiprocessor platform using the earliest-deadline first scheduling algorithm. Many real-time scheduling algorithms have been developed recently to reduce affinity in the portable devices that use processors. Extensive power aware scheduling techniques have been published for energy reduction, but most of them have been focused solely on reducing the processor affinity.

	{'abstract': u'We investigate two quantities of interest in a delay-tolerant mobile ad hoc network: the network capacity region and the minimum energy function. The network capacity region is defined as the set of all input rates that the network can stably support considering all possible scheduling and routing algorithms. Given any input rate vector in this region, the minimum energy function establishes the minimum time average power required to support it. In this work, we consider a cell-partitioned model of a delay-tolerant mobile ad hoc network with general Markovian mobility. This simple model incorporates the essential features of locality of wireless transmissions as well as node mobility and enables us to exactly compute the corresponding network capacity and minimum energy function. Further, we propose simple schemes that offer performance guarantees that are arbitrarily close to these bounds at the cost of an increased delay.',

	{'abstract': u'Learning algorithms are essential for the applications of game theory in a networking environment. In dynamic and decentralized settings where the traffic, topology and channel states may vary over time and the communication between agents is impractical, it is important to formulate and study games of incomplete information and fully distributed learning algorithms which for each agent requires a minimal amount of information regarding the remaining agents. In this paper, we address this major challenge and introduce heterogeneous learning schemes in which each agent adopts a distinct learning pattern in the context of games with incomplete information. We use stochastic approximation techniques to show that the heterogeneous learning schemes can be studied in terms of their deterministic ordinary differential equation (ODE) counterparts. Depending on the learning rates of the players, these ODEs could be different from the standard replicator dynamics, (myopic) best response (BR) dynamics, logit dynamics, and fictitious play dynamics. We apply the results to a class of security games in which the attacker and the defender adopt different learning schemes due to differences in their rationality levels and the information they acquire.',

	{'abstract': u'Quadratic Programming (QP) is the well-studied problem of maximizing over values the quadratic form sum_ a_ x_i x_j. QP captures many known combinatorial optimization problems, and assuming the unique games conjecture, semidefinite programming techniques give optimal approximation algorithms. We extend this body of work by initiating the study of Quadratic Programming problems where the variables take values in the domain . The specific problems we study are QP-Ratio : max_^n frac a_ x_i x_j, and Normalized QP-Ratio : max_^n frac a_ x_i x_j, where d_i = sum_j |a_| We consider an SDP relaxation obtained by adding constraints to the natural eigenvalue (or SDP) relaxation for this problem. Using this, we obtain an algorithm for QP-ratio. We also obtain an approximation for bipartite graphs, and better algorithms for special cases. As with other problems with ratio objectives (e.g. uniform sparsest cut), it seems difficult to obtain inapproximability results based on P!=NP. We give two results that indicate that QP-Ratio is hard to approximate to within any constant factor. We also give a natural distribution on instances of QP-Ratio for which an n^ epsilon approximation (for epsilon roughly 1/10) seems out of reach of current techniques.',

	{'abstract': u'This paper addresses the problem of simultaneous signal recovery and dictionary learning based on compressive measurements. Multiple signals are analyzed jointly, with multiple sensing matrices, under the assumption that the unknown signals come from a union of a small number of disjoint subspaces. This problem is important, for instance, in image inpainting applications, in which the multiple signals are constituted by (incomplete) image patches taken from the overall image. This work extends standard dictionary learning and block-sparse dictionary optimization, by considering compressive measurements, e.g., incomplete data). Previous work on blind compressed sensing is also generalized by using multiple sensing matrices and relaxing some of the restrictions on the learned dictionary. Drawing on results developed in the context of matrix completion, it is proven that both the dictionary and signals can be recovered with high probability from compressed measurements. The solution is unique up to block permutations and invertible linear transformations of the dictionary atoms. The recovery is contingent on the number of measurements per signal and the number of signals being sufficiently large; bounds are derived for these quantities. In addition, this paper presents a computationally practical algorithm that performs dictionary learning and signal recovery, and establishes conditions for its convergence to a local optimum. Experimental results for image inpainting demonstrate the capabilities of the method.',

The methods have been applied to the Spoken British National Corpus, which is an extensive and varied corpus of natural unscripted speech. Early results show good agreement with human ratings of alignment accuracy. The methods also provide an indication of the location of likely alignment problems; this should allow efficient manual examination of large corpora. Automatic checking of such alignments is crucial when analysing any very large corpus, since even the best current speech alignment systems will occasionally make serious errors. The methods described here use a hybrid approach based on statistics of the speech signal itself, statistics of the labels being evaluated, and statistics linking the two.',

	{'abstract': u'Domain decomposition methods are widely used to solve sparse linear systems from scientific problems, but they are not suited to solve sparse linear systems extracted from integrated circuits. The reason is that the sparse linear system of integrated circuits may be non-diagonal-dominant, and domain decomposition method might be unconvergent for these non-diagonal-dominant matrices. In this paper, we propose a mini-step strategy to do the circuit transient analysis. Different from the traditional large-step approach, this strategy is able to generate diagonal-dominant sparse linear systems. As a result, preconditioned domain decomposition methods can be used to simulate the large integrated circuits on the supercomputers and clouds.',

	{'abstract': u'A token ring is an arrangement of N processors that take turns engaging in an activity which must be controlled. A token confers the right to engage in the controlled activity. Processors communicate with neighbors in the ring to obtain and release a token. The communication mechanism investigated in this paper is the safe register abstraction, which may arbitrarily corrupt a value that a processor reads when the operation reading a register is concurrent with an write operation on that register by a neighboring processor. The main results are simple protocols for quasi-atomic communication, constructed from safe registers. A quasi-atomic register behaves atomically except that a special undefined value may be returned in the case of concurrent read and write operations. Under certain conditions that constrain the number of writes and registers, quasi-atomic protocols are adequate substitutes for atomic protocols. The paper demonstrates how quasi-atomic protocols can be used to implement a self-stabilizing token ring, either by using two safe registers between neighboring processors or by using O(lg N) safe registers between neighbors, which lowers read complexity.',

	{'abstract': u'Given two independent point processes and a certain rule for matching points between them, what is the fraction of matched points over infinitely long streams? In many application contexts, e.g., secure networking, a meaningful matching rule is that of a maximum causal delay, and the problem is related to embedding a flow of packets in cover traffic such that no traffic analysis can detect it. We study the best undetectable embedding policy and the corresponding maximum flow rate ---that we call the embedding capacity--- under the assumption that the cover traffic can be modeled as arbitrary renewal processes. We find that computing the embedding capacity requires the inversion of very structured linear systems that, for a broad range of renewal models encountered in practice, admits a fully analytical expression in terms of the renewal function of the processes. Our main theoretical contribution is a simple closed form of such relationship. This result enables us to explore properties of the embedding capacity, obtaining closed-form solutions for selected distribution families and a suite of sufficient conditions on the capacity ordering. We evaluate our solution on real network traces, which shows a noticeable match for tight delay constraints. A gap between the predicted and the actual embedding capacities appears for looser constraints, and further investigation reveals that it is caused by inaccuracy of the renewal traffic model rather than of the solution itself.',

	{'abstract': u'In this paper, we consider the problem of multi-relay selection for multi-stream cooperative MIMO systems with relay nodes. Traditionally, relay selection approaches are primarily focused on selecting one relay node to improve the transmission reliability given a single-antenna destination node. As such, in the cooperative phase whereby both the source and the selected relay nodes transmit to the destination node, it is only feasible to exploit cooperative spatial diversity (for example by means of distributed space time coding). For wireless systems with a multi-antenna destination node, in the cooperative phase it is possible to opportunistically transmit multiple data streams to the destination node by utilizing multiple relay nodes. Therefore, we propose a low overhead multi-relay selection protocol to support multi-stream cooperative communications. In addition, we derive the asymptotic performance results at high SNR for the proposed scheme and discuss the diversity-multiplexing tradeoff as well as the throughput-reliability tradeoff. From these results, we show that the proposed multi-stream cooperative communication scheme achieves lower outage probability compared to existing baseline schemes.',

	{'abstract': u'There have been several recent advancements in Machine Learning community on the Entity Matching (EM) problem. However, their lack of scalability has prevented them from being applied in practical settings on large real-life datasets. Towards this end, we propose a principled framework to scale any generic EM algorithm. Our technique consists of running multiple instances of the EM algorithm on small neighborhoods of the data and passing messages across neighborhoods to construct a global solution. We prove formal properties of our framework and experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in scaling EM algorithms.',

	{'abstract': u'Set intersection is a fundamental operation in information retrieval and database systems. This paper introduces linear space data structures to represent sets such that their intersection can be computed in a worst-case efficient way. In general, given k (preprocessed) sets, with totally n elements, we will show how to compute their intersection in expected time O(n/sqrt(w)+kr), where r is the intersection size and w is the number of bits in a machine-word. In addition,we introduce a very simple version of this algorithm that has weaker asymptotic guarantees but performs even better in practice; both algorithms outperform the state of the art techniques in terms of execution time for both synthetic and real data sets and workloads.',

	{'abstract': u'This paper is about a better understanding on the structure and dynamics of science and the usage of these insights for compensating the typical problems that arises in metadata-driven Digital Libraries. Three science model driven retrieval services are presented: co-word analysis based query expansion, re-ranking via Bradfordizing and author centrality. The services are evaluated with relevance assessments from which two important implications emerge: (1) precision values of the retrieval service are the same or better than the tf-idf retrieval baseline and (2) each service retrieved a disjoint set of documents. The different services each favor quite other - but still relevant - documents than pure term-frequency based rankings. The proposed models and derived retrieval services therefore open up new viewpoints on the scientific knowledge space and provide an alternative framework to structure scholarly information systems.',

	{'abstract': u"Spinnaker is an experimental datastore that is designed to run on a large cluster of commodity servers in a single datacenter. It features key-based range partitioning, 3-way replication, and a transactional get-put API with the option to choose either strong or timeline consistency on reads. This paper describes Spinnaker's Paxos-based replication protocol. The use of Paxos ensures that a data partition in Spinnaker will be available for reads and writes as long a majority of its replicas are alive. Unlike traditional master-slave replication, this is true regardless of the failure sequence that occurs. We show that Paxos replication can be competitive with alternatives that provide weaker consistency guarantees. Compared to an eventually consistent datastore, we show that Spinnaker can be as fast or even faster on reads and only 5% to 10% slower on writes.",

	{'abstract': u'This article investigates selfish behavior in games where players are embedded in a social context. A framework is presented which allows us to measure the Windfall of Friendship, i.e., how much players benefit (compared to purely selfish environments) if they care about the welfare of their friends in the social network graph. As a case study, a virus inoculation game is examined. We analyze the corresponding Nash equilibria and show that the Windfall of Friendship can never be negative. However, we find that if the valuation of a friend is independent of the total number of friends, the social welfare may not increase monotonically with the extent to which players care for each other; intriguingly, in the corresponding scenario where the relative importance of a friend declines, the Windfall is monotonic again. This article also studies convergence of best-response sequences. It turns out that in social networks, convergence times are typically higher and hence constitute a price of friendship. While such phenomena may be known on an anecdotal level, our framework allows us to quantify these effects analytically. Our formal insights on the worst case equilibria are complemented by simulations shedding light onto the structure of other equilibria.',

Usability might be a strong basic in relating to the applicability for learning, and in this study pertaining to Mandarin learning. It was also found that aesthetically pleasing layouts of web page would motivate students in Mandarin learning The Mandarin Learning web pages were manipulated according to the desired aesthetic measurements. GUI aesthetic measuring method was used for this purpose. The Aesthetics-Measurement Application (AMA) accomplished with six aesthetic measures was developed and used. On top of it, questionnaires were distributed to the users to gather information on the students' perceptions on the aesthetic aspects and learning aspects. Respondents for this study were students taking Mandarin course level I at UiTM Terengganu. A significant correlation of the aesthetic aspect was found with its relevance to Mandarin learning. In summary, aesthetics should not be ignored or overlooked in designing effective learning interfaces for educational purposes.",

	{'abstract': u"This article describes the accurateness of our application namely Self-Developed Aesthetics Measurement Application (SDA) in measuring the aesthetics aspect by comparing the results of our application and users' perceptions in measuring the aesthetics of the web page interfaces. For this research, the positions of objects, images element and texts element are defined as objects in a web page interface. Mandarin learning web pages are used in this research. These learning web pages comprised of main pages, learning pages and exercise pages, on the first author's E-portfolio web site. The objects of the web pages were manipulated in order to produce the desired aesthetic values. The six aesthetics related elements used are balance, equilibrium, symmetry, sequence, rhythm, as well as order and complexity. Results from the research showed that the ranking of the aesthetics values of the web page interfaces measured of the users were congruent with the expected perceptions of our designed Mandarin learning web page interfaces (reported also in [18]). Thus, it implies that the subjectivity of aesthetics can be measured in an objective manner. For further understanding on our effort in doing aesthetics measurement, we discussed in details the object modelling used as well as the process in developing this application. We also explained the steps on how to run our application. Additionally, the strength and the weakness of our SDA application shared in this paper suggest that there is still room for the improvement for aesthetics measurement.",

	{'abstract': u'Detecting misbehavior (such as transmissions of false information) in vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) is very important problem with wide range of implications including safety related and congestion avoidance applications. We discuss several limitations of existing misbehavior detection schemes (MDS) designed for VANETs. Most MDS are concerned with detection of malicious nodes. In most situations, vehicles would send wrong information because of selfish reasons of their owners, e.g. for gaining access to a particular lane. Because of this ( emph), it is more important to detect false information than to identify misbehaving nodes. We introduce the concept of data-centric misbehavior detection and propose algorithms which detect false alert messages and misbehaving nodes by observing their actions after sending out the alert messages. With the data-centric MDS, each node can independently decide whether an information received is correct or false. The decision is based on the consistency of recent messages and new alert with reported and estimated vehicle positions. No voting or majority decisions is needed, making our MDS resilient to Sybil attacks. Instead of revoking all the secret credentials of misbehaving nodes, as done in most schemes, we impose fines on misbehaving nodes (administered by the certification authority), discouraging them to act selfishly. This reduces the computation and communication costs involved in revoking all the secret credentials of misbehaving nodes.',

	{'abstract': u'An emotional version of Sapir-Whorf hypothesis suggests that differences in language emotionalities influence differences among cultures no less than conceptual differences. Conceptual contents of languages and cultures to significant extent are determined by words and their semantic differences; these could be borrowed among languages and exchanged among cultures. Emotional differences, as suggested in the paper, are related to grammar and mostly cannot be borrowed. Conceptual and emotional mechanisms of languages are considered here along with their functions in the mind and cultural evolution. A fundamental contradiction in human mind is considered: language evolution requires reduced emotionality, but "too low" emotionality makes language "irrelevant to life," disconnected from sensory-motor experience. Neural mechanisms of these processes are suggested as well as their mathematical models: the knowledge instinct, the language instinct, the dual model connecting language and cognition, dynamic logic, neural modeling fields. Mathematical results are related to cognitive science, linguistics, and psychology. Experimental evidence and theoretical arguments are discussed. Approximate equations for evolution of human minds and cultures are obtained. Their solutions identify three types of cultures: "conceptual"-pragmatic cultures, in which emotionality of language is reduced and differentiation overtakes synthesis resulting in fast evolution at the price of uncertainty of values, self doubts, and internal crises; "traditional-emotional" cultures where differentiation lags behind synthesis, resulting in cultural stability at the price of stagnation; and "multi-cultural" societies combining fast cultural evolution and stability. Unsolved problems and future theoretical and experimental directions are discussed.',

	{'abstract': u'Various applications of car plate recognition systems have been developed using various kinds of methods and techniques by researchers all over the world. The applications developed were only suitable for specific country due to its standard specification endorsed by the transport department of particular countries. The Road Transport Department of Malaysia also has endorsed a specification for car plates that includes the font and size of characters that must be followed by car owners. However, there are cases where this specification is not followed. Several applications have been developed in Malaysia to overcome this problem. However, there is still problem in achieving 100% recognition accuracy. This paper is mainly focused on conducting an experiment using chain codes technique to perform recognition for different types of fonts used in Malaysian car plates.',

	{'abstract': u'Technology progress in DNA sequencing boosts the genomic database growth at faster and faster rate. Compression, accompanied with random access capabilities, is the key to maintain those huge amounts of data. In this paper we present an LZ77-style compression scheme for relative compression of multiple genomes of the same species. While the solution bears similarity to known algorithms, it offers significantly higher compression ratios at compression speed over a order of magnitude greater. One of the new successful ideas is augmenting the reference sequence with phrases from the other sequences, making more LZ-matches available.',

	{'abstract': u'In this paper, we investigate the theoretical guarantees of penalized minimization (also called Basis Pursuit Denoising or Lasso) in terms of sparsity pattern recovery (support and sign consistency) from noisy measurements with non-necessarily random noise, when the sensing operator belongs to the Gaussian ensemble (i.e. random design matrix with i.i.d. Gaussian entries). More precisely, we derive sharp non-asymptotic bounds on the sparsity level and (minimal) signal-to-noise ratio that ensure support identification for most signals and most Gaussian sensing matrices by solving the Lasso problem with an appropriately chosen regularization parameter. Our first purpose is to establish conditions allowing exact sparsity pattern recovery when the signal is strictly sparse. Then, these conditions are extended to cover the compressible or nearly sparse case. In these two results, the role of the minimal signal-to-noise ratio is crucial. Our third main result gets rid of this assumption in the strictly sparse case, but this time, the Lasso allows only partial recovery of the support. We also provide in this case a sharp -consistency result on the coefficient vector. The results of the present work have several distinctive features compared to previous ones. One of them is that the leading constants involved in all the bounds are sharp and explicit. This is illustrated by some numerical experiments where it is indeed shown that the sharp sparsity level threshold identified by our theoretical results below which sparsistency of the Lasso is guaranteed meets that empirically observed.',

	{'abstract': u"Sensing on smartphones is known to be power-hungry. It has been shown that this problem can be solved by adding an ultra low-power processor to execute simple, frequent sensor data processing. While very effective in saving energy, this resulting heterogeneous, distributed architecture poses a significant challenge to application development. We present Reflex, a suite of runtime and compilation techniques to conceal the heterogeneous, distributed nature from developers. The Reflex automatically transforms the developer's code for distributed execution with the help of the Reflex runtime. To create a unified system illusion, Reflex features a novel software distributed shared memory (DSM) design that leverages the extreme architectural asymmetry between the low-power processor and the powerful central processor to achieve both energy efficiency and performance. We report a complete realization of Reflex for heterogeneous smartphones with Maemo/Linux as the central kernel. Using a tri-processor hardware prototype and sensing applications reported in recent literature, we evaluate the Reflex realization for programming transparency, energy efficiency, and performance. We show that Reflex supports a programming style that is very close to contemporary smartphone programming. It allows existing sensing applications to be ported with minor source code changes. Reflex reduces the system power in sensing by up to 83%, and its runtime system only consumes 10% local memory on a typical ultra-low power processor.",

	{'abstract': u'The Parikh finite word automaton (PA) was introduced and studied by Klaedtke and Ruess in 2003. Natural variants of the PA arise from viewing a PA equivalently as an automaton that keeps a count of its transitions and semilinearly constrains their numbers. Here we adopt this view and define the affine PA (APA), that extends the PA by having each transition induce an affine transformation on the PA registers, and the PA on letters (LPA), that restricts the PA by forcing any two transitions on same letter to affect the registers equally. Then we report on the expressiveness, closure, and decidability properties of such PA variants. We note that deterministic PA are strictly weaker than deterministic reversal-bounded counter machines. We develop pumping-style lemmas and identify an explicit PA language recognized by no deterministic PA.',

	{'abstract': u'Most machine learning tools work with a single table where each row is an instance and each column is an attribute. Each cell of the table contains an attribute value for an instance. This representation prevents one important form of learning, which is, classification based on groups of correlated records, such as multiple exams of a single patient, internet customer preferences, weather forecast or prediction of sea conditions for a given day. To some extent, relational learning methods, such as inductive logic programming, can capture this correlation through the use of intensional predicates added to the background knowledge. In this work, we propose SPPAM, an algorithm that aggregates past observations in one single record. We show that applying SPPAM to the original correlated data, before the learning task, can produce classifiers that are better than the ones trained using all records.',

Three basic schemes and their achievable rates are studied: For the decode-and-forward (DF) scheme, we obtain the achievable rate by letting the source send a common message and two private messages; for the compress-and-forward (CF) scheme, we exploit the conferencing links to help with the compression of the received signals, or to exchange messages intended for the second hop to introduce certain cooperation; for the amplify-and-forward (AF) scheme, we study the optimal combining strategy between the received signals from the source and the conferencing link. Moreover, we show that these schemes could achieve the capacity upper bound under certain conditions. Finally, we evaluate the various rates for the Gaussian case with numerical results.',

	{'abstract': u'Dictionaries are inherently circular in nature. A given word is linked to a set of alternative words (the definition) which in turn point to further descendants. Iterating through definitions in this way, one typically finds that definitions loop back upon themselves. The graph formed by such definitional relations is our object of study. By eliminating those links which are not in loops, we arrive at a core subgraph of highly connected nodes. We observe that definitional loops are conveniently classified by length, with longer loops usually emerging from semantic misinterpretation. By breaking the long loops in the graph of the dictionary, we arrive at a set of disconnected clusters. We find that the words in these clusters constitute semantic units, and moreover tend to have been introduced into the English language at similar times, suggesting a possible mechanism for language evolution.',

	{'abstract': u'Many applications in cellular systems and sensor networks involve a random subset of a large number of users asynchronously reporting activity to a base station. This paper examines the problem of multiuser detection (MUD) in random access channels for such applications. Traditional orthogonal signaling ignores the random nature of user activity in this problem and limits the total number of users to be on the order of the number of signal space dimensions. Contention-based schemes, on the other hand, suffer from delays caused by colliding transmissions and the hidden node problem. In contrast, this paper presents a novel pairing of an asynchronous non-orthogonal code-division random access scheme with a convex optimization-based MUD algorithm that overcomes the issues associated with orthogonal signaling and contention-based methods. Two key distinguishing features of the proposed MUD algorithm are that it does not require knowledge of the delay or channel state information of every user and it has polynomial-time computational complexity. The main analytical contribution of this paper is the relationship between the performance of the proposed MUD algorithm in the presence of arbitrary or random delays and two simple metrics of the set of user codewords. The study of these metrics is then focused on two specific sets of codewords, random binary codewords and specially constructed algebraic codewords, for asynchronous random access. The ensuing analysis confirms that the proposed scheme together with either of these two codeword sets significantly outperforms the orthogonal signaling-based random access in terms of the total number of users in the system.',

	{'abstract': u'This paper presents and analyses the implementation of a novel active queue management (AQM) named FavorQueue that aims to improve delay transfer of short lived TCP flows over best-effort networks. The idea is to dequeue packets that do not belong to a flow previously enqueued first. The rationale is to mitigate the delay induced by long-lived TCP flows over the pace of short TCP data requests and to prevent dropped packets at the beginning of a connection and during recovery period. Although the main target of this AQM is to accelerate short TCP traffic, we show that FavorQueue does not only improve the performance of short TCP traffic but also improves the performance of all TCP traffic in terms of drop ratio and latency whatever the flow size. In particular, we demonstrate that FavorQueue reduces the loss of a retransmitted packet, decreases the number of dropped packets recovered by RTO and improves the latency up to 30% compared to DropTail. Finally, we show that this scheme remains compliant with recent TCP updates such as the increase of the initial slow-start value.',

	{'abstract': u'It is well known that in a firm real time system with a renewal arrival process, exponential service times and independent and identically distributed deadlines till the end of service of a job, the earliest deadline first (EDF) scheduling policy has smaller loss ratio (expected fraction of jobs, not completed) than any other service time independent scheduling policy, including the first come first served (FCFS). Various modifications to the EDF and FCFS policies have been proposed in the literature, with a view to improving performance. In this article, we compare the loss ratios of these two policies along with some of the said modifications, as well as their counterparts with deterministic deadlines. The results include some formal inequalities and some counter-examples to establish non-existence of an order. A few relations involving loss ratios are posed as conjectures, and simulation results in support of these are reported. These results lead to a complete picture of dominance and non-dominance relations between pairs of scheduling policies, in terms of loss ratios.',

	{'abstract': u'We consider distributed algorithms for data aggregation and function computation in sensor networks. The algorithms perform pairwise computations along edges of an underlying communication graph. A token is associated with each sensor node, which acts as a transmission permit. Nodes with active tokens have transmission permits; they generate messages at a constant rate and send each message to a randomly selected neighbor. By using different strategies to control the transmission permits we can obtain tradeoffs between message and time complexity. Gossip corresponds to the case when all nodes have permits all the time. We study algorithms where permits are revoked after transmission and restored upon reception. Examples of such algorithms include Simple-Random Walk(SRW), Coalescent-Random-Walk(CRW) and Controlled Flooding(CFLD) and their hybrid variants. SRW has a single node permit, which is passed on in the network. CRW, initially initially has a permit for each node but these permits are revoked gradually. The final result for SRW and CRW resides at a single(or few) random node(s) making a direct comparison with GOSSIP difficult. A hybrid two-phase algorithm switching from CRW to CFLD at a suitable pre-determined time can be employed to achieve consensus. We show that such hybrid variants achieve significant gains in both message and time complexity. The per-node message complexity for n-node graphs, such as 2D mesh, torii, and Random geometric graphs, scales as and the corresponding time complexity scales as O(n). The reduced per-node message complexity leads to reduced energy utilization in sensor networks.',

	{'abstract': u'The optimal diversity-multiplexing-delay tradeoff for the multi-input multi-output (MIMO) automatic repeat request (ARQ) channel can be achieved using incremental redundancy lattice space-time codes coupled with a list decoder for joint error detection and correction. Such a decoder is based on the minimum mean-square error lattice decoding principle which is implemented using sphere decoding algorithms. However, sphere decoders suffer from high computational complexity for low-to-moderate signal-to-noise ratios, especially for large signal dimensions. In this paper, we would like to construct a more efficient decoder that is capable of achieving the optimal tradeoff with much lower complexity. In particular, we will study the throughput-performance-complexity tradeoffs in sequential decoding algorithms and the effect of preprocessing and termination strategies. We show, analytically and via simulation, that using the textit that implements a time-out algorithm for joint error detection and correction, the optimal tradeoff of the MIMO ARQ channel can be achieved with significant reduction in decoding complexity.',

Our general model of asynchronous communications defines a clear separation between analog and digital concerns. This separation enables the combination of theorem proving and model-checking for an efficient methodology. The analog phenomena are formalized in the logic of Isabelle/HOL. The gate-level hardware is automatically analyzed using IHaVeIt. Our proof reveals the correct values of a crucial parameter of the bit-clock synchronization mechanism.

	{'abstract': u'This paper investigates the price-based resource allocation strategies for the uplink transmission of a spectrum-sharing femtocell network, in which a central macrocell is underlaid with distributed femtocells, all operating over the same frequency band as the macrocell. Assuming that the macrocell base station (MBS) protects itself by pricing the interference from the femtocell users, a Stackelberg game is formulated to study the joint utility maximization of the macrocell and the femtocells subject to a maximum tolerable interference power constraint at the MBS. Especially, two practical femtocell channel models: sparsely deployed scenario for rural areas and densely deployed scenario for urban areas, are investigated. For each scenario, two pricing schemes: uniform pricing and non-uniform pricing, are proposed. Then, the Stackelberg equilibriums for these proposed games are studied, and an effective distributed interference price bargaining algorithm with guaranteed convergence is proposed for the uniform-pricing case. Finally, numerical examples are presented to verify the proposed studies. It is shown that the proposed algorithms are effective in resource allocation and macrocell protection requiring minimal network overhead for spectrum-sharing-based two-tier femtocell networks.',

	{'abstract': u"We develop several analytical lower bounds on the capacity of binary insertion and deletion channels by considering independent uniformly distributed (i.u.d.) inputs and computing lower bounds on the mutual information between the input and output sequences. For the deletion channel, we consider two different models: independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) deletion-substitution channel and i.i.d. deletion channel with additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN). These two models are considered to incorporate effects of the channel noise along with the synchronization errors. For the insertion channel case we consider the Gallager's model in which the transmitted bits are replaced with two random bits and uniform over the four possibilities independently of any other insertion events. The general approach taken is similar in all cases, however the specific computations differ. Furthermore, the approach yields a useful lower bound on the capacity for a wide range of deletion probabilities for the deletion channels, while it provides a beneficial bound only for small insertion probabilities (less than 0.25) for the insertion model adopted. We emphasize the importance of these results by noting that 1) our results are the first analytical bounds on the capacity of deletion-AWGN channels, 2) the results developed are the best available analytical lower bounds on the deletion-substitution case, 3) for the Gallager insertion channel model, the new lower bound improves the existing results for small insertion probabilities.",

	{'abstract': u'Electoral control models ways of changing the outcome of an election via such actions as adding/deleting/partitioning either candidates or voters. To protect elections from such control attempts, computational complexity has been investigated and the corresponding NP-hardness results are termed "resistance." It has been a long-running project of research in this area to classify the major voting systems in terms of their resistance properties. We show that fallback voting, an election system proposed by Brams and Sanver (2009) to combine Bucklin with approval voting, is resistant to each of the common types of control except to destructive control by either adding or deleting voters. Thus fallback voting displays the broadest control resistance currently known to hold among natural election systems with a polynomial-time winner problem. We also study the control complexity of Bucklin voting and show that it performs at least almost as well as fallback voting in terms of control resistance. As Bucklin voting is a special case of fallback voting, each resistance shown for Bucklin voting strengthens the corresponding resistance for fallback voting. Such worst-case complexity analysis is at best an indication of security against control attempts, rather than a proof. In practice, the difficulty of control will depend on the structure of typical instances. We investigate the parameterized control complexity of Bucklin and fallback voting, according to several parameters that are often likely to be small for typical instances. Our results, though still in the worst-case complexity model, can be interpreted as significant strengthenings of the resistance demonstrations based on NP-hardness.',

	{'abstract': u'Models of computational trust support users in taking decisions. They are commonly used to guide users\' judgements in online auction sites; or to determine quality of contributions in Web 2.0 sites. However, most existing systems require historical information about the past behavior of the specific agent being judged. In contrast, in real life, to anticipate and to predict a stranger\'s actions in absence of the knowledge of such behavioral history, we often use our "instinct"- essentially stereotypes developed from our past interactions with other "similar" persons. In this paper, we propose StereoTrust, a computational trust model inspired by stereotypes as used in real-life. A stereotype contains certain features of agents and an expected outcome of the transaction. When facing a stranger, an agent derives its trust by aggregating stereotypes matching the stranger\'s profile. Since stereotypes are formed locally, recommendations stem from the trustor\'s own personal experiences and perspective. Historical behavioral information, when available, can be used to refine the analysis. According to our experiments using Epinions.com dataset, StereoTrust compares favorably with existing trust models that use different kinds of information and more complete historical information.',

	{'abstract': u'A widely adopted two-dimensional Markov chain model of the IEEE 802.11 DCF was introduced by Bianchi to characterize the backoff behavior of a single node under a saturated traffic condition. Using this approach, we propose a queuing model for the 802.11 DCF under a non-saturated traffic environment. The input buffer of each node is modeled as a Geo/G/1 queue, and the packet service time distribution is derived from Markov state space of 802.11 DCF with the underlying scheduling algorithm. The DCF defines two access mechanisms, namely the Basic access mechanism and the request-to-send/clear-to-send (RTS/CTS) access mechanism. Based on our model, performance analyses of both schemes are studied with probabilistic exponential backoff scheduling. We obtain the characteristic equation of network throughput and expressions of packet queueing delay. Specifically, we obtain the stable throughput and bounded delay regions with respect to the retransmission factor according to the basic queueing analysis. For both access schemes, the bounded delay region is a subset of the stable throughput region. Our results show that the RTS/CTS access mechanism is more stable and performs better than the Basic access mechanism. The analysis in this paper is verified by simulation results.',

	{'abstract': u'In a scheduling game, each player owns a job and chooses a machine to execute it. While the social cost is the maximal load over all machines (makespan), the cost (disutility) of each player is the completion time of its own job. In the game, players may follow selfish strategies to optimize their cost and therefore their behaviors do not necessarily lead the game to an equilibrium. Even in the case there is an equilibrium, its makespan might be much larger than the social optimum, and this inefficiency is measured by the price of anarchy -- the worst ratio between the makespan of an equilibrium and the optimum. Coordination mechanisms aim to reduce the price of anarchy by designing scheduling policies that specify how jobs assigned to a same machine are to be scheduled. Typically these policies define the schedule according to the processing times as announced by the jobs. One could wonder if there are policies that do not require this knowledge, and still provide a good price of anarchy. This would make the processing times be private information and avoid the problem of truthfulness. In this paper we study these so-called non-clairvoyant policies. In particular, we study the RANDOM policy that schedules the jobs in a random order without preemption, and the EQUI policy that schedules the jobs in parallel using time-multiplexing, assigning each job an equal fraction of CPU time.',

	{'abstract': u'Cellular networks are in a major transition from a carefully planned set of large tower-mounted base-stations (BSs) to an irregular deployment of heterogeneous infrastructure elements that often additionally includes micro, pico, and femtocells, as well as distributed antennas. In this paper, we develop a tractable, flexible, and accurate model for a downlink heterogeneous cellular network (HCN) consisting of K tiers of randomly located BSs, where each tier may differ in terms of average transmit power, supported data rate and BS density. Assuming a mobile user connects to the strongest candidate BS, the resulting Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise-Ratio (SINR) is greater than 1 when in coverage, Rayleigh fading, we derive an expression for the probability of coverage (equivalently outage) over the entire network under both open and closed access, which assumes a strikingly simple closed-form in the high SINR regime and is accurate down to -4 dB even under weaker assumptions. For external validation, we compare against an actual LTE network (for tier 1) with the other K-1 tiers being modeled as independent Poisson Point Processes. In this case as well, our model is accurate to within 1-2 dB. We also derive the average rate achieved by a randomly located mobile and the average load on each tier of BSs. One interesting observation for interference-limited open access networks is that at a given SINR, adding more tiers and/or BSs neither increases nor decreases the probability of coverage or outage when all the tiers have the same target-SINR.',

	{'abstract': u'Consider the communication of a single-user aided by a nearby relay involved in a large wireless network where the nodes form an homogeneous Poisson point process. Since this network is interference-limited the asymptotic error probability is bounded from above by the outage probability experienced by the user. We investigate the outage behavior for the well-known cooperative schemes, namely, decode-and-forward (DF) and compress-and-forward (CF). In this setting, the outage events are induced by both fading and the spatial proximity of neighbor nodes who generate the strongest interference and hence the worst communication case. Upper and lower bounds on the asymptotic error probability which are tight in some cases are derived. It is shown that there exists a clear trade off between the network density and the benefits of user cooperation. These results are useful to evaluate performances and to optimize relaying schemes in the context of large wireless networks.',

	{'abstract': u'Displays based on organic light-emitting diode (OLED) technology are appearing on many mobile devices. Unlike liquid crystal displays (LCD), OLED displays consume dramatically different power for showing different colors. In particular, OLED displays are inefficient for showing bright colors. This has made them undesirable for mobile devices because much of the web content is of bright colors. To tackle this problem, we present the motivational studies, design, and realization of Chameleon, a color adaptive web browser that renders web pages with power-optimized color schemes under user-supplied constraints. Driven by the findings from our motivational studies, Chameleon provides end users with important options, offloads tasks that are not absolutely needed in real-time, and accomplishes real-time tasks by carefully enhancing the codebase of a browser engine. According to measure-ments with OLED smartphones, Chameleon is able to re-duce average system power consumption for web browsing by 41% and reduce display power consumption by 64% without introducing any noticeable delay.',

A key enabling contribution for our analysis is a significantly sharpened method for computing a statistical bound for the service given to a flow by the network as a whole. For a suitably parsimonious traffic model we develop closed-form expressions for end-to-end delays, backlog, and output burstiness. The deterministic versions of our bounds yield optimal bounds on end-to-end backlog and output burstiness for some schedulers, and are highly accurate for end-to-end delay bounds.',

For k&gt;=5 the same bounds hold for general k-SAT. We show that this is also the case for k=3,4, using a slightly modified PPSZ algorithm. We do the analysis by defining a cost for satisfiable CNF formulas, which we prove to decrease in each PPSZ step by a certain amount.

	{'abstract': u'Dictionary lookup methods are popular in dealing with ambiguous letters which were not recognized by Optical Character Readers. However, a robust dictionary lookup method can be complex as apriori probability calculation or a large dictionary size increases the overhead and the cost of searching. In this context, Levenshtein distance is a simple metric which can be an effective string approximation tool. After observing the effectiveness of this method, an improvement has been made to this method by grouping some similar looking alphabets and reducing the weighted difference among members of the same group. The results showed marked improvement over the traditional Levenshtein distance technique.',

	{'abstract': u'In this paper, we study the complexity of computing the determinant of a matrix over a non-commutative algebra. In particular, we ask the question, "over which algebras, is the determinant easier to compute than the permanent?" Towards resolving this question, we show the following hardness and easiness of noncommutative determinant computation. * [Hardness] Computing the determinant of an n times n matrix whose entries are themselves 2 times 2 matrices over a field is as hard as computing the permanent over the field. This extends the recent result of Arvind and Srinivasan, who proved a similar result which however required the entries to be of linear dimension. * [Easiness] Determinant of an n times n matrix whose entries are themselves d times d upper triangular matrices can be computed in poly(n^d) time. Combining the above with the decomposition theorem of finite dimensional algebras (in particular exploiting the simple structure of 2 times 2 matrix algebras), we can extend the above hardness and easiness statements to more general algebras as follows. Let A be a finite dimensional algebra over a finite field with radical R(A). * [Hardness] If the quotient A/R(A) is non-commutative, then computing the determinant over the algebra A is as hard as computing the permanent. * [Easiness] If the quotient A/R(A) is commutative and furthermore, R(A) has nilpotency index d (i.e., the smallest d such that R(A)d = 0), then there exists a poly(n^d)-time algorithm that computes determinants over the algebra A. In particular, for any constant dimensional algebra A over a finite field, since the nilpotency index of R(A) is at most a constant, we have the following dichotomy theorem: if A/R(A) is commutative, then efficient determinant computation is feasible and otherwise determinant is as hard as permanent.',

	{'abstract': u'We present a new algorithm for estimating the star discrepancy of arbitrary point sets. Similar to the algorithm for discrepancy approximation of Winker and Fang [SIAM J. Numer. Anal. 34 (1997), 2028--2042] it is based on the optimization algorithm threshold accepting. Our improvements include, amongst others, a non-uniform sampling strategy which is more suited for higher-dimensional inputs, and rounding steps which transform axis-parallel boxes, on which the discrepancy is to be tested, into emph. These critical test boxes provably yield higher discrepancy values, and contain the box that exhibits the maximum value of the local discrepancy. We provide comprehensive experiments to test the new algorithm. Our randomized algorithm computes the exact discrepancy frequently in all cases where this can be checked (i.e., where the exact discrepancy of the point set can be computed in feasible time). Most importantly, in higher dimension the new method behaves clearly better than all previously known methods.',

	{'abstract': u'The traditional Power Grid has been designed in a hierarchical fashion, with Energy pushed from the large scale production facilities towards the end users. But with the increasing availability of micro and medium scale generating facilities, the situation is changing. Many end users can now produce energy and share it over the Power Grid. Naturally, end users need to have incentives to do so and might want to be able to act in an open decentralized energy market. In the present work, we offer a novel analysis of the Medium and Low Voltage Power Grids of the North Netherlands using statistical tools from the Complex Network Analysis field. We use a weighted model based on actual Grid data and propose a set of statistical measures to evaluate the adequacy of the current infrastructure for a decentralized energy market. Further, we use the insight gained by the analysis to propose parameters that tie the statistical topological measures to economic factors that might influence the attractiveness to the end users in participating in such a decentralized energy market, thus identifying what are the important topological parameters to work on to facilitate such open decentralized markets.',

	{'abstract': u'We study in this paper provenance information for queries with aggregation. Provenance information was studied in the context of various query languages that do not allow for aggregation, and recent work has suggested to capture provenance by annotating the different database tuples with elements of a commutative semiring and propagating the annotations through query evaluation. We show that aggregate queries pose novel challenges rendering this approach inapplicable. Consequently, we propose a new approach, where we annotate with provenance information not just tuples but also the individual values within tuples, using provenance to describe the values computation. We realize this approach in a concrete construction, first for "simple" queries where the aggregation operator is the last one applied, and then for arbitrary (positive) relational algebra queries with aggregation; the latter queries are shown to be more challenging in this context. Finally, we use aggregation to encode queries with difference, and study the semantics obtained for such queries on provenance annotated databases.',

	{'abstract': u"In this paper, we study multibeam satellite secure communication through physical (PHY) layer security techniques, i.e., joint power control and beamforming. By first assuming that the Channel State Information (CSI) is available and the beamforming weights are fixed, a novel secure satellite system design is investigated to minimize the transmit power with individual secrecy rate constraints. An iterative algorithm is proposed to obtain an optimized power allocation strategy. Moreover, sub-optimal beamforming weights are obtained by completely eliminating the co-channel interference and nulling the eavesdroppers' signal simultaneously. In order to obtain jointly optimized power allocation and beamforming strategy in some practical cases, e.g., with certain estimation errors of the CSI, we further evaluate the impact of the eavesdropper's CSI on the secure multibeam satellite system design. The convergence of the iterative algorithm is proven under justifiable assumptions. The performance is evaluated by taking into account the impact of the number of antenna elements, number of beams, individual secrecy rate requirement, and CSI. The proposed novel secure multibeam satellite system design can achieve optimized power allocation to ensure the minimum individual secrecy rate requirement. The results show that the joint beamforming scheme is more favorable than fixed beamforming scheme, especially in the cases of a larger number of satellite antenna elements and higher secrecy rate requirement. Finally, we compare the results under the current satellite air-interface in DVB-S2 and the results under Gaussian inputs.",

It builds multiple random forest ensembles on distributed blocks of data and merges them into a mega-ensemble. This approach is appropriate when learning from massive-scale data that is too large to fit on a single machine. To get the best accuracy, IVoting should be used instead of bagging to generate the training subset for each decision tree in the random forest. Experiments with two large datasets (5GB and 50GB compressed) show that COMET compares favorably (in both accuracy and training time) to learning on a subsample of data using a serial algorithm. Finally, we propose a new Gaussian approach for lazy ensemble evaluation which dynamically decides how many ensemble members to evaluate per data point; this can reduce evaluation cost by 100X or more.',

	{'abstract': u'The first part of the article describes our approach for solution of this problem by means of Augmented Reality. The merging of the real world model and digital objects allows streamline the work with the model and speed up the whole production phase significantly. The main advantage of augmented reality is the possibility of direct manipulation with the scene using a portable digital camera. Also adding digital objects into the scene could be done using identification markers placed on the surface of the model. Therefore it is not necessary to work with special input devices and lose the contact with the real world model. Adjustments are done directly on the model. The key problem of outlined solution is the ability of identification of an object within the camera picture and its replacement with the digital object. The second part of the article is focused especially on the identification of exact position and orientation of the marker within the picture. The identification marker is generalized into the triple of points which represents a general plane in space. There is discussed the space identification of these points and the description of representation of their position and orientation be means of transformation matrix. This matrix is used for rendering of the graphical objects (e. g. in OpenGL and Direct3D).',

	{'abstract': u'We consider the Gaussian N-relay diamond network, where a source wants to communicate to a destination node through a layer of N-relay nodes. We investigate the following question: what fraction of the capacity can we maintain by using only k out of the N available relays? We show that independent of the channel configurations and the operating SNR, we can always find a subset of k relays which alone provide a rate (kC/(k+1))-G, where C is the information theoretic cutset upper bound on the capacity of the whole network and G is a constant that depends only on N and k (logarithmic in N and linear in k). In particular, for k = 1, this means that half of the capacity of any N-relay diamond network can be approximately achieved by routing information over a single relay. We also show that this fraction is tight: there are configurations of the N-relay diamond network where every subset of k relays alone can at most provide approximately a fraction k/(k+1) of the total capacity. These high-capacity k-relay subnetworks can be also discovered efficiently. We propose an algorithm that computes a constant gap approximation to the capacity of the Gaussian N-relay diamond network in O(N log N) running time and discovers a high-capacity k-relay subnetwork in O(kN) running time. This result also provides a new approximation to the capacity of the Gaussian N-relay diamond network which is hybrid in nature: it has both multiplicative and additive gaps. In the intermediate SNR regime, this hybrid approximation is tighter than existing purely additive or purely multiplicative approximations to the capacity of this network.',

	{'abstract': u'In the online channel coding model, a sender wishes to communicate a message to a receiver by transmitting a codeword x =(x_1,...,x_n) in ^n bit by bit via a channel limited to at most pn corruptions. The channel is online in the sense that at the ith step the channel decides whether to flip the ith bit or not and its decision is based only on the bits transmitted so far, i.e., (x_1,...,x_i). This is in contrast to the classical adversarial channel in which the corruption is chosen by a channel that has full knowledge on the sent codeword x. The best known lower bound on the capacity of both the online channel and the classical adversarial channel is the well-known Gilbert-Varshamov bound. In this paper we prove a lower bound on the capacity of the online channel which beats the Gilbert-Varshamov bound for any positive p such that H(2p) &lt; 0.5 (where H is the binary entropy function). To do so, we prove that for any such p, a code chosen at random combined with the nearest neighbor decoder achieves with high probability a rate strictly higher than the Gilbert-Varshamov bound (for the online channel).',

	{'abstract': u'In previous work, we presented a symbolic execution method which starts with a concrete model of the program but progressively abstracts away details only when these are known to be irrelevant using interpolation. In this paper, we extend the technique to handle unbounded loops. The central idea is to progressively discover the strongest invariants through a process of loop unrolling. The key feature of this technique, called the minimax algorithm, is intelligent backtracking which directs the search for the next invariant. We then present an analysis of the main differences between our symbolic execution method and mainstream techniques mainly based on abstract refinement (CEGAR). Finally, we evaluate our technique against available state-of-the-art systems.',

	{'abstract': u'Operational semantics has established itself as a flexible but rigorous means to describe the meaning of programming languages. Oftentimes, it is felt necessary to keep a semantics small, for example to facilitate its use for model checking by avoiding state space explosion. However, omitting many details in a semantics typically makes results valid for a limited core language only, leaving a wide gap towards any real implementation. In this paper we present a full-fledged semantics of the concurrent object-oriented programming language SCOOP (Simple Concurrent Object-Oriented Programming). The semantics has been found detailed enough to guide an implementation of the SCOOP compiler and runtime system, and to detect and correct a variety of errors and ambiguities in the original informal specification and prototype implementation. In our formal specification, we use abstract data types with preconditions and axioms to describe the state, and introduce a number of special run-time operations to model the runtime system with our inference rules. This approach allows us to make our large formal specification manageable, providing a first step towards reference documents for specifying object-oriented languages based on operational semantics.',

	{'abstract': u'Connectivity is one of the most fundamental properties of wireless multi-hop networks. A network is said to be connected if there is a path between any pair of nodes. A convenient way to study the connectivity of a random network is by investigating the condition under which the network has no isolated node. The condition under which the network has no isolated node provides a necessary condition for a connected network. Further the condition for a network to have no isolated node and the condition for the network to be connected can often be shown to asymptotically converge to be the same as the number of nodes approaches infinity, given a suitably defined random network and connection model. Currently analytical results on the distribution of the number of isolated nodes only exist for the unit disk model. This study advances research in the area by providing the asymptotic distribution of the number of isolated nodes in random networks with nodes Poissonly distributed on a unit square under a generic random connection model. On that basis we derive a necessary condition for the above network to be asymptotically almost surely connected. These results, together with results in a companion paper on the sufficient condition for a network to be connected, expand recent results obtained for connectivity of random geometric graphs assuming a unit disk model to results assuming a more generic and more practical random connection model.',

	{'abstract': u'We revisit the coalition structure generation problem in which the goal is to partition the players into exhaustive and disjoint coalitions so as to maximize the social welfare. One of our key results is a general polynomial-time algorithm to solve the problem for all coalitional games provided that player types are known and the number of player types is bounded by a constant. As a corollary, we obtain a polynomial-time algorithm to compute an optimal partition for weighted voting games with a constant number of weight values and for coalitional skill games with a constant number of skills. We also consider well-studied and well-motivated coalitional games defined compactly on combinatorial domains. For these games, we characterize the complexity of computing an optimal coalition structure by presenting polynomial-time algorithms, approximation algorithms, or NP-hardness and inapproximability lower bounds.',
