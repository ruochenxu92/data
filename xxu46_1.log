	{'abstract': u'Machine Consciousness and Machine Intelligence are not simply new buzzwords that occupy our imagination. Over the last decades, we witness an unprecedented rise in attempts to create machines with human-like features and capabilities. However, despite widespread sympathy and abundant funding, progress in these enterprises is far from being satisfactory. The reasons for this are twofold: First, the notions of cognition and intelligence (usually borrowed from human behavior studies) are notoriously blurred and ill-defined, and second, the basic concepts underpinning the whole discourse are by themselves either undefined or defined very vaguely. That leads to improper and inadequate research goals determination, which I will illustrate with some examples drawn from recent documents issued by DARPA and the European Commission. On the other hand, I would like to propose some remedies that, I hope, would improve the current state-of-the-art disgrace.',

	{'abstract': u'Energy-efficient communication is an important requirement for mobile relay networks due to the limited battery power of user terminals. This paper considers energy-efficient relaying schemes through selection of mobile relays in cooperative cellular systems with asymmetric traffic. The total energy consumption per information bit of the battery-powered terminals, i.e., the mobile station (MS) and the relay, is derived in theory. In the Joint Uplink and Downlink Relay Selection (JUDRS) scheme we proposed, the relay which minimizes the total energy consumption is selected. Additionally, the energy-efficient cooperation regions are investigated, and the optimal relay location is found for cooperative cellular systems with asymmetric traffic. The results reveal that the MS-relay and the relay-base station (BS) channels have different influence over relay selection decisions for optimal energy-efficiency. Information theoretic analysis of the diversity-multiplexing tradeoff (DMT) demonstrates that the proposed scheme achieves full spatial diversity in the quantity of cooperating terminals in this network. Finally, numerical results further confirm a significant energy efficiency gain of the proposed algorithm comparing to the previous best worse channel selection and best harmonic mean selection algorithms.',

Unlike previous algorithms for this problem, which may produce drawings with exponential area, our method produces drawings with polynomial area. In addition, we allow for collinear points on the boundary, provided such vertices do not create overlapping edges. Thus, we solve an open problem of Duncan et al., which, when combined with their work, implies that we can produce a planar straight-line drawing of a combinatorially-embedded genus-g graph with the graph's canonical polygonal schema drawn as a convex polygonal external face.",

	{'abstract': u'This paper presents our investigations on emotional state categorization from speech signals with a psychologically inspired computational model against human performance under the same experimental setup. Based on psychological studies, we propose a multistage categorization strategy which allows establishing an automatic categorization model flexibly for a given emotional speech categorization task. We apply the strategy to the Serbian Emotional Speech Corpus (GEES) and the Danish Emotional Speech Corpus (DES), where human performance was reported in previous psychological studies. Our work is the first attempt to apply machine learning to the GEES corpus where the human recognition rates were only available prior to our study. Unlike the previous work on the DES corpus, our work focuses on a comparison to human performance under the same experimental settings. Our studies suggest that psychology-inspired systems yield behaviours that, to a great extent, resemble what humans perceived and their performance is close to that of humans under the same experimental setup. Furthermore, our work also uncovers some differences between machine and humans in terms of emotional state recognition from speech.',

	{'abstract': u'We explore the hypothesis that it is possible to obtain information about the dynamics of a blog network by analysing the temporal relationships between blogs at a semantic level, and that this type of analysis adds to the knowledge that can be extracted by studying the network only at the structural level of URL links. We present an algorithm to automatically detect fine-grained discussion topics, characterized by n-grams and time intervals. We then propose a probabilistic model to estimate the temporal relationships that blogs have with one another. We define the precursor score of blog A in relation to blog B as the probability that A enters a new topic before B, discounting the effect created by asymmetric posting rates. Network-level metrics of precursor and laggard behavior are derived from these dyadic precursor score estimations. This model is used to analyze a network of French political blogs. The scores are compared to traditional link degree metrics. We obtain insights into the dynamics of topic participation on this network, as well as the relationship between precursor/laggard and linking behaviors. We validate and analyze results with the help of an expert on the French blogosphere. Finally, we propose possible applications to the improvement of search engine ranking algorithms.',

The second experiment shows that the use of the TTP Toolkit is likely (p-value: 0.10) to almost triple the accuracy of programmers performing tasks associated with software quality. The third experiment shows that the TTP Toolkit does not offer significant productivity gains in performing very short (under 10 min.) tasks.',

	{'abstract': u'Boolean-width is a recently introduced graph parameter. Many problems are fixed parameter tractable when parametrized by boolean-width, for instance "Minimum Weighted Dominating Set" (MWDS) problem can be solved in time given a boolean-decomposition of width , hence for all graph classes where a boolean-decomposition of width can be found in polynomial time, MWDS can be solved in polynomial time. We study graph classes having boolean-width and problems solvable in , combining these two results to design polynomial algorithms. We show that for trapezoid graphs, circular permutation graphs, convex graphs, Dilworth- graphs, circular arc graphs and complements of -degenerate graphs, boolean-decompositions of width can be found in polynomial time. We also show that circular -trapezoid graphs have boolean-width , and find such a decomposition if a circular -trapezoid intersection model is given. For many of the graph classes we also prove that they contain graphs of boolean-width . Further we apply the results from cite to give a new polynomial time algorithm solving all vertex partitioning problems introduced by Proskurowski and Telle cite. This extends previous results by Kratochv \'il, Manuel and Miller cite showing that a large subset of the vertex partitioning problems are polynomial solvable on interval graphs.',

	{'abstract': u'How can we model influence between individuals in a social system, even when the network of interactions is unknown? In this article, we review the literature on the "influence model," which utilizes independent time series to estimate how much the state of one actor affects the state of another actor in the system. We extend this model to incorporate dynamical parameters that allow us to infer how influence changes over time, and we provide three examples of how this model can be applied to simulated and real data. The results show that the model can recover known estimates of influence, it generates results that are consistent with other measures of social networks, and it allows us to uncover important shifts in the way states may be transmitted between actors at different points in time.',

	{'abstract': u'The skyline concept has been introduced in order to exhibit the best objects according to all the criterion combinations and makes it possible to analyse the relationships between skyline objects. Like the data cube, the skycube is so voluminous that reduction approaches are really necessary. In this paper, we define an approach which partially materializes the skycube. The underlying idea is to discard from the representation the skycuboids which can be computed again the most easily. To meet this reduction objective, we characterize a formal framework: the agree concept lattice. From this structure, we derive the skyline concept lattice which is one of its constrained instances. The strong points of our approach are: (i) it is attribute oriented; (ii) it provides a boundary for the number of lattice nodes; (iii) it facilitates the navigation within the Skycuboids.',

	{'abstract': u'Stochastic network calculus provides an elegant way to characterize traffic and service processes. However, little effort has been made on applying it to multi-access communication systems such as 802.11. In this paper, we take the first step to apply it to the backlog and delay analysis of an 802.11 wireless local network. In particular, we address the following questions: In applying stochastic network calculus, under what situations can we derive stable backlog and delay bounds? How to derive the backlog and delay bounds of an 802.11 wireless node? And how tight are these bounds when compared with simulations? To answer these questions, we first derive the general stability condition of a wireless node (not restricted to 802.11). From this, we give the specific stability condition of an 802.11 wireless node. Then we derive the backlog and delay bounds of an 802.11 node based on an existing model of 802.11. We observe that the derived bounds are loose when compared with ns-2 simulations, indicating that improvements are needed in the current version of stochastic network calculus.',

Two schemes are presented based on this idea by embedding the watermark data in the low pass wavelet coefficients of each block.

	{'abstract': u"We study the design of truthful mechanisms that do not use payments for the generalized assignment problem (GAP) and its variants. An instance of the GAP consists of a bipartite graph with jobs on one side and machines on the other. Machines have capacities and edges have values and sizes; the goal is to construct a welfare maximizing feasible assignment. In our model of private valuations, motivated by impossibility results, the value and sizes on all job-machine pairs are public information; however, whether an edge exists or not in the bipartite graph is a job's private information. We study several variants of the GAP starting with matching. For the unweighted version, we give an optimal strategyproof mechanism; for maximum weight bipartite matching, however, we show give a 2-approximate strategyproof mechanism and show by a matching lowerbound that this is optimal. Next we study knapsack-like problems, which are APX-hard. For these problems, we develop a general LP-based technique that extends the ideas of Lavi and Swamy to reduce designing a truthful mechanism without money to designing such a mechanism for the fractional version of the problem, at a loss of a factor equal to the integrality gap in the approximation ratio. We use this technique to obtain strategyproof mechanisms with constant approximation ratios for these problems. We then design an O(log n)-approximate strategyproof mechanism for the GAP by reducing, with logarithmic loss in the approximation, to our solution for the value-invariant GAP. Our technique may be of independent interest for designing truthful mechanisms without money for other LP-based problems.",

The proposed scheme is zero-knowledge and relies on an NP-complete problem coming from coding theory (namely the q-ary Syndrome Decoding problem). Taking into account a recent study of a generalization of Stern's information-set-decoding algorithm for decoding linear codes over arbitrary finite fields Fq we suggest parameters so that the public key be 34Kbits while those of Stern's scheme is about 66Kbits.

	{'abstract': u'This paper proposes a new detection algorithm for MIMO communication systems employing high order QAM constellations. The factor graph that corresponds to this problem is very loopy; in fact, it is a complete graph. Hence, a straightforward application of the Belief Propagation (BP) algorithm yields very poor results. Our algorithm is based on an optimal tree approximation of the Gaussian density of the unconstrained linear system. The finite-set constraint is then applied to obtain a loop-free discrete distribution. It is shown that even though the approximation is not directly applied to the exact discrete distribution, applying the BP algorithm to the loop-free factor graph outperforms current methods in terms of both performance and complexity. The improved performance of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated on the problem of MIMO detection.',

The substate properties such as its dielectric constant, loss tangent have a pronounced effect on the antenna characteristics. Some of the critical properties that are to be taken care of while selecting a dielectric are homogeneity, moisture absorption and adhesion of metal- foil cladding.

	{'abstract': u'In this paper, we show that performance of the virtualized cluster servers could be improved through intelligent decision over migration time of Virtual Machines across heterogeneous physical nodes of a cluster server. The cluster serves a variety range of services from Web Service to File Service. Some of them are CPU-Intensive while others are RAM-Intensive and so on. Virtualization has many advantages such as less hardware cost, cooling cost, more manageability. One of the key benefits is better load balancing by using of VM migration between hosts. To migrate, we must know which virtual machine needs to be migrated and when this relocation has to be done and, moreover, which host must be destined. To relocate VMs from overloaded servers to underloaded ones, we need to sort nodes from the highest volume to the lowest. There are some models to finding the most overloaded node, but they have some shortcomings. The focus of this paper is to present a new method to migrate VMs between cluster nodes using TOPSIS algorithm - one of the most efficient Multi Criteria Decision Making techniques- to make more effective decision over whole active servers of the Cluster and find the most loaded serversTo evaluate the performance improvement resulted from this model, we used cluster Response time and Unbalanced Factor.',

	{'abstract': u'One of the biggest drawbacks of the wireless environment is the limited bandwidth. However, the users sharing this limited bandwidth have been increasing considerably.Space Division Multiple Access (SDMA) is a new technology by which the capacity of existing mobile communication systems can economically be increased. This paper has been presented how the capacity can be enhanced by using SDMA with smart antennas in mobile communications system. Based on Adaptive Antenna Array (AAA) technology the spatial dimension of the existing system is exploited by means of forming independent radio beams in each of the original channels. This paper analyses the comparison of average Bit Error Rate (BER) of SDMA and CDMA technique and the different ways in which SDMA can be introduced to increase the capacity of a cellular system. The probability of error is found for a standard omni directional base station antenna, and another set of curves is found for flat top beam having a directivity of 5.1dB. It is assumed that k separate flat top beams can be formed by base station and pointed each of the k users within the cell of interest. Noticing that for an average probability of error greater than 0.1 in a propagation path loss environment of n=4, the flat top beam will support 200 users, whereas the omni-directional antenna will support only 50 users. This increase the number of user is roughly equal to the directivity offered by the flat top beam system, and illustrates the promise SDMA offers for improving capacity in wireless system. Here multipath fading is not considered.',

	{'abstract': u'Combined with space-time coding, the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) system explores space diversity. It is a potential scheme to offer spectral efficiency and robust high data rate transmissions over frequency-selective fading channel. However, space-time coding impairs the system ability to suppress interferences as the signals transmitted from two transmit antennas are superposed and interfered at the receiver antennas. In this paper, we developed an adaptive beamforming based on least mean squared error algorithm and null deepening to combat co-channel interference (CCI) for the space-time coded OFDM (STC-OFDM) system. To illustrate the performance of the presented approach, it is compared to the null steering beamformer which requires a prior knowledge of directions of arrival (DOAs). The structure of space-time decoders are preserved although there is the use of beamformers before decoding. By incorporating the proposed beamformer as a CCI canceller in the STC-OFDM systems, the performance improvement is achieved as shown in the simulation results.',

	{'abstract': u'Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) systems have recently emerged as a key technology in wireless communication systems for increasing both data rates and system performance. There are many schemes that can be applied to MIMO systems such as space time block codes, space time trellis codes, and the Vertical Bell Labs Space-Time Architecture (V-BLAST). This paper proposes a novel signal detector scheme called MIMO detectors to enhance the performance in MIMO channels. We study the general MIMO system, the general V-BLAST architecture with Maximum Likelihood (ML), Zero- Forcing (ZF), Minimum Mean- Square Error (MMSE), and Ordered Successive Interference Cancellation (SIC) detectors and simulate this structure in Rayleigh fading channel. Also compares the performances of MIMO system with different modulation techniques in Fading and AWGN channels. Base on frame error rates and bit error rates, we compare the performance and the computational complexity of these schemes with other existence model.Simulations shown that V-BLAST implements a detection technique, i.e. SIC receiver, based on ZF or MMSE combined with symbol cancellation and optimal ordering to improve the performance with lower complexity, although ML receiver appears to have the best SER performance-BLAST achieves symbol error rates close to the ML scheme while retaining the lowcomplexity nature of the V-BLAST.',

	{'abstract': u'We focus on the downlink of a cellular system, which corresponds to the bulk of the data transfer in such wireless systems. We address the problem of opportunistic multiuser scheduling under imperfect channel state information, by exploiting the memory inherent in the channel. In our setting, the channel between the base station and each user is modeled by a two-state Markov chain and the scheduled user sends back an ARQ feedback signal that arrives at the scheduler with a random delay that is i.i.d across users and time. The scheduler indirectly estimates the channel via accumulated delayed-ARQ feedback and uses this information to make scheduling decisions. We formulate a throughput maximization problem as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP). For the case of two users in the system, we show that a greedy policy is sum throughput optimal for any distribution on the ARQ feedback delay. For the case of more than two users, we prove that the greedy policy is suboptimal and demonstrate, via numerical studies, that it has near optimal performance. We show that the greedy policy can be implemented by a simple algorithm that does not require the statistics of the underlying Markov channel or the ARQ feedback delay, thus making it robust against errors in system parameter estimation. Establishing an equivalence between the two-user system and a genie-aided system, we obtain a simple closed form expression for the sum capacity of the Markov-modeled downlink. We further derive inner and outer bounds on the capacity region of the Markov-modeled downlink and tighten these bounds for special cases of the system parameters.',

	{'abstract': u'The non-repudiation as an essential requirement of many applications can be provided by the asymmetric key model. With the evolution of new applications such as mobile commerce, it is essential to provide secure and efficient solutions for the mobile environments. The traditional public key cryptography involves huge computational costs and is not so suitable for the resource-constrained platforms. The elliptic curve-based approaches as the newer solutions require certain considerations that are not taken into account in the traditional public key infrastructures. The main contribution of this paper is to introduce a Lightweight Public Key Infrastructure (LPKI) for the constrained platforms such as mobile phones. It takes advantages of elliptic curve cryptography and signcryption to decrease the computational costs and communication overheads, and adapting to the constraints. All the computational costs of required validations can be eliminated from end-entities by introduction of a validation authority to the introduced infrastructure and delegating validations to such a component. LPKI is so suitable for mobile environments and for applications such as mobile commerce where the security is the great concern.',

	{'abstract': u"This paper presents three feedback controllers that achieve an asymptotically stable, periodic, and fast walking gait for a 3D (spatial) bipedal robot consisting of a torso, two legs, and passive (unactuated) point feet. The contact between the robot and the walking surface is assumed to inhibit yaw rotation. The studied robot has 8 DOF in the single support phase and 6 actuators. The interest of studying robots with point feet is that the robot's natural dynamics must be explicitly taken into account to achieve balance while walking. We use an extension of the method of virtual constraints and hybrid zero dynamics, in order to simultaneously compute a periodic orbit and an autonomous feedback controller that realizes the orbit. This method allows the computations to be carried out on a 2-DOF subsystem of the 8-DOF robot model. The stability of the walking gait under closed-loop control is evaluated with the linearization of the restricted Poincar 'e map of the hybrid zero dynamics. Three strategies are explored. The first strategy consists of imposing a stability condition during the search of a periodic gait by optimization. The second strategy uses an event-based controller. In the third approach, the effect of output selection is discussed and a pertinent choice of outputs is proposed, leading to stabilization without the use of a supplemental event-based controller.",

	{'abstract': u'The max-product algorithm, a local message-passing scheme that attempts to compute the most probable assignment (MAP) of a given probability distribution, has been successfully employed as a method of approximate inference for applications arising in coding theory, computer vision, and machine learning. However, the max-product algorithm is not guaranteed to converge to the MAP assignment, and if it does, is not guaranteed to recover the MAP assignment. Alternative convergent message-passing schemes have been proposed to overcome these difficulties. This work provides a systematic study of such message-passing algorithms that extends the known results by exhibiting new sufficient conditions for convergence to local and/or global optima, providing a combinatorial characterization of these optima based on graph covers, and describing a new convergent and correct message-passing algorithm whose derivation unifies many of the known convergent message-passing algorithms. While convergent and correct message-passing algorithms represent a step forward in the analysis of max-product style message-passing algorithms, the conditions needed to guarantee convergence to a global optimum can be too restrictive in both theory and practice. This limitation of convergent and correct message-passing schemes is characterized by graph covers and illustrated by example.',

	{'abstract': u'In Information Retrieval (IR), whether implicitly or explicitly, queries and documents are often represented as vectors. However, it may be more beneficial to consider documents and/or queries as multidimensional objects. Our belief is this would allow building "truly" interactive IR systems, i.e., where interaction is fully incorporated in the IR framework. The probabilistic formalism of quantum physics represents events and densities as multidimensional objects. This paper presents our first step towards building an interactive IR framework upon this formalism, by stating how the first interaction of the retrieval process, when the user types a query, can be formalised. Our framework depends on a number of parameters affecting the final document ranking. In this paper we experimentally investigate the effect of these parameters, showing that the proposed representation of documents and queries as multidimensional objects can compete with standard approaches, with the additional prospect to be applied to interactive retrieval.',

	{'abstract': u'We consider the problem of subspace estimation in situations where the number of available snapshots and the observation dimension are comparable in magnitude. In this context, traditional subspace methods tend to fail because the eigenvectors of the sample correlation matrix are heavily biased with respect to the true ones. It has recently been suggested that this situation (where the sample size is small compared to the observation dimension) can be very accurately modeled by considering the asymptotic regime where the observation dimension and the number of snapshots converge to at the same rate. Using large random matrix theory results, it can be shown that traditional subspace estimates are not consistent in this asymptotic regime. Furthermore, new consistent subspace estimate can be proposed, which outperform the standard subspace methods for realistic values of and . The work carried out so far in this area has always been based on the assumption that the observations are random, independent and identically distributed in the time domain. The goal of this paper is to propose new consistent subspace estimators for the case where the source signals are modelled as unknown deterministic signals. In practice, this allows to use the proposed approach regardless of the statistical properties of the source signals. In order to construct the proposed estimators, new technical results concerning the almost sure location of the eigenvalues of sample covariance matrices of Information plus Noise complex Gaussian models are established. These results are believed to be of independent interest.',

	{'abstract': u'Information theoretic Broadcast Channels (BC) and Multiple Access Channels (MAC) enable a single node to transmit data simultaneously to multiple nodes, and multiple nodes to transmit data simultaneously to a single node respectively. In this paper, we address the problem of link scheduling in multihop wireless networks containing nodes with BC and MAC capabilities. We first propose an interference model that extends protocol interference models, originally designed for point to point channels, to include the possibility of BC and MAC. Due to the high complexity of optimal link schedulers, we introduce the Multiuser Greedy Maximum Weight algorithm for link scheduling in multihop wireless networks containing BCs and MACs. Given a network graph, we develop new local pooling conditions and show that the performance of our algorithm can be fully characterized using the associated parameter, the multiuser local pooling factor. We provide examples of some network graphs, on which we apply local pooling conditions and derive the multiuser local pooling factor. We prove optimality of our algorithm in tree networks and show that the exploitation of BCs and MACs improve the throughput performance considerably in multihop wireless networks.',

	{'abstract': u"Similarity networks are important abstractions in many information management applications such as recommender systems, corpora analysis, and medical informatics. For instance, by inducing similarity networks between movies rated similarly by users, or between documents containing common terms, and or between clinical trials involving the same themes, we can aim to find the global structure of connectivities underlying the data, and use the network as a basis to make connections between seemingly disparate entities. In the above applications, composing similarities between objects of interest finds uses in serendipitous recommendation, in storytelling, and in clinical diagnosis, respectively. We present an algorithmic framework for traversing similarity paths using the notion of `hammock' paths which are generalization of traditional paths. Our framework is exploratory in nature so that, given starting and ending objects of interest, it explores candidate objects for path following, and heuristics to admissibly estimate the potential for paths to lead to a desired destination. We present three diverse applications: exploring movie similarities in the Netflix dataset, exploring abstract similarities across the PubMed corpus, and exploring description similarities in a database of clinical trials. Experimental results demonstrate the potential of our approach for unstructured knowledge discovery in similarity networks.",

	{'abstract': u'In this paper, we consider full-duplex and half-duplex Gaussian relay channels where the noises at the relay and destination are arbitrarily correlated. We first derive the capacity upper bound and the achievable rates with three existing schemes: Decode-and-Forward (DF), Compress-and-Forward (CF), and Amplify-and-Forward (AF). We present two capacity results under specific noise correlation coefficients, one being achieved by DF and the other being achieved by direct link transmission (or a special case of CF). The channel for the former capacity result is equivalent to the traditional Gaussian degraded relay channel and the latter corresponds to the Gaussian reversely-degraded relay channel. For CF and AF schemes, we show that their achievable rates are strictly decreasing functions over the negative correlation coefficient. Through numerical comparisons under different channel settings, we observe that although DF completely disregards the noise correlation while the other two can potentially exploit such extra information, none of the three relay schemes always outperforms the others over different correlation coefficients. Moreover, the exploitation of noise correlation by CF and AF accrues more benefit when the source-relay link is weak. This paper also considers the optimal power allocation problem under the correlated-noise channel setting. With individual power constraints at the relay and the source, it is shown that the relay should use all its available power to maximize the achievable rates under any correlation coefficient. With a total power constraint across the source and the relay, the achievable rates are proved to be concave functions over the power allocation factor for AF and CF under full-duplex mode, where the closed-form power allocation strategy is derived.',

	{'abstract': u'A noisy network coding scheme for sending multiple sources over a general noisy network is presented. For multi-source multicast networks, the scheme naturally extends both network coding over noiseless networks by Ahlswede, Cai, Li, and Yeung, and compress-forward coding for the relay channel by Cover and El Gamal to general discrete memoryless and Gaussian networks. The scheme also recovers as special cases the results on coding for wireless relay networks and deterministic networks by Avestimehr, Diggavi, and Tse, and coding for wireless erasure networks by Dana, Gowaikar, Palanki, Hassibi, and Effros. The scheme involves message repetition coding, relay signal compression, and simultaneous decoding. Unlike previous compress--forward schemes, where independent messages are sent over multiple blocks, the same message is sent multiple times using independent codebooks as in the network coding scheme for cyclic networks. Furthermore, the relays do not use Wyner--Ziv binning as in previous compress-forward schemes, and each decoder performs simultaneous joint typicality decoding on the received signals from all the blocks without explicitly decoding the compression indices. A consequence of this new scheme is that achievability is proved simply and more generally without resorting to time expansion to extend results for acyclic networks to networks with cycles. The noisy network coding scheme is then extended to general multi-source networks by combining it with decoding techniques for interference channels. For the Gaussian multicast network, noisy network coding improves the previously established gap to the cutset bound. We also demonstrate through two popular AWGN network examples that noisy network coding can outperform conventional compress-forward, amplify-forward, and hash-forward schemes.',

Unlike the previously known bounds on SQ learning our characterization preserves the accuracy and the efficiency of learning. The preservation of accuracy implies that that our characterization gives the first characterization of SQ learning in the agnostic learning framework. The preservation of efficiency is achieved using a new boosting technique and allows us to derive a new approach to the design of evolutionary algorithms in Valiant's (2006) model of evolvability. We use this approach to demonstrate the existence of a large class of monotone evolutionary learning algorithms based on square loss performance estimation. These results differ significantly from the few known evolutionary algorithms and give evidence that evolvability in Valiant's model is a more versatile phenomenon than there had been previous reason to suspect.",

Content-based file type detection is a newer way that is taken into account recently. In this paper, a new content-based method for the purpose of file type detection and file type clustering is proposed that is based on the PCA and neural networks. The proposed method has a good accuracy and is fast enough.',

	{'abstract': u'The GSM network with the greatest worldwide number of users, succumbs to several security vulnerabilities. The short message service (SMS) is one of its superior and well-tried services with a global availability in the GSM networks. The main contribution of this paper is to introduce a new secure application layer protocol, called SSMS, to efficiently embed the desired security attributes in the SMS messages to be used as a secure bearer in the m-payment systems. SSMS efficiently embeds the confidentiality, integrity, authentication, and non-repudiation in the SMS messages. It provides an elliptic curve-based public key solution that uses public keys for the secret key establishment of a symmetric encryption. It also provides the attributes of public verification and forward secrecy. It efficiently makes the SMS messaging suitable for the m-payment applications where the security is the great concern.',

	{'abstract': u'We study error bounds for linear programming decoding of regular LDPC codes. For memoryless binary-input output-symmetric channels, we prove bounds on the word error probability that are inverse doubly-exponential in the girth of the factor graph. For memoryless binary-input AWGN channel, we prove lower bounds on the threshold for regular LDPC codes whose factor graphs have logarithmic girth under LP-decoding. Specifically, we prove a lower bound of (upper bound of dB) on the threshold of -regular LDPC codes whose factor graphs have logarithmic girth. Our proof is an extension of a recent paper of Arora, Daskalakis, and Steurer [STOC 2009] who presented a novel probabilistic analysis of LP decoding over a binary symmetric channel. Their analysis is based on the primal LP representation and has an explicit connection to message passing algorithms. We extend this analysis to any MBIOS channel.',

	{'abstract': u"Ads on the Internet are increasingly sold via ad exchanges such as RightMedia, AdECN and Doubleclick Ad Exchange. These exchanges allow real-time bidding, that is, each time the publisher contacts the exchange, the exchange ``calls out'' to solicit bids from ad networks. This aspect of soliciting bids introduces a novel aspect, in contrast to existing literature. This suggests developing a joint optimization framework which optimizes over the allocation and well as solicitation. We model this selective call out as an online recurrent Bayesian decision framework with bandwidth type constraints. We obtain natural algorithms with bounded performance guarantees for several natural optimization criteria. We show that these results hold under different call out constraint models, and different arrival processes. Interestingly, the paper shows that under MHR assumptions, the expected revenue of generalized second price auction with reserve is constant factor of the expected welfare. Also the analysis herein allow us prove adaptivity gap type results for the adwords problem.",

In particular, it has been shown that minimizing the expected deviation from the causal input-output dependencies of the true plant leads to a new promising stochastic control rule called the Bayesian control rule. This work proves the convergence of the Bayesian control rule under two sufficient assumptions: boundedness, which is an ergodicity condition; and consistency, which is an instantiation of the sure-thing principle.',

	{'abstract': u"Dynamic Spectrum Access systems exploit temporarily available spectrum (`white spaces') and can spread transmissions over a number of non-contiguous sub-channels. Such methods are highly beneficial in terms of spectrum utilization. However, excessive fragmentation degrades performance and hence off-sets the benefits. Thus, there is a need to study these processes so as to determine how to ensure acceptable levels of fragmentation. Hence, we present experimental and analytical results derived from a mathematical model. We model a system operating at capacity serving requests for bandwidth by assigning a collection of gaps (sub-channels) with no limitations on the fragment size. Our main theoretical result shows that even if fragments can be arbitrarily small, the system does not degrade with time. Namely, the average total number of fragments remains bounded. Within the very difficult class of dynamic fragmentation models (including models of storage fragmentation), this result appears to be the first of its kind. Extensive experimental results describe behavior, at times unexpected, of fragmentation under different algorithms. Our model also applies to dynamic linked-list storage allocation, and provides a novel analysis in that domain. We prove that, interestingly, the 50% rule of the classical (non-fragmented) allocation model carries over to our model. Overall, the paper provides insights into the potential behavior of practical fragmentation algorithms.",

	{'abstract': u'Live sequence charts (LSCs) have been proposed as an inter-object scenario-based specification and visual programming language for reactive systems. In this paper, we introduce a logic-based framework to check the consistency of an LSC specification. An LSC simulator has been implemented in logic programming, utilizing a memoized depth-first search strategy, to show how a reactive system in LSCs would response to a set of external event sequences. A formal notation is defined to specify external event sequences, extending the regular expression with a parallel operator and a testing control. The parallel operator allows interleaved parallel external events to be tested in LSCs simultaneously; while the testing control provides users to a new approach to specify and test certain temporal properties (e.g., CTL formula) in a form of LSC. Our framework further provides either a state transition graph or a failure trace to justify the consistency checking results.',

User-understandable models are defined during the modeling phase but rewriting or tuning them is manda- tory to get solving-efficient models. We propose a new architecture al- lowing to define bridges between any (modeling or solver) languages and to implement model optimizations. This architecture follows a model- driven approach where the constraint modeling process is seen as a set of model transformations. Among others, an interesting feature is the def- inition of transformations as concept-oriented rules, i.e. based on types of model elements where the types are organized into a hierarchy called a metamodel.',

	{'abstract': u'We investigate the role of cooperation in wireless networks subject to a spatial degrees of freedom limitation. To address the worst case scenario, we consider a free-space line-of-sight type environment with no scattering and no fading. We identify three qualitatively different operating regimes that are determined by how the area of the network A, normalized with respect to the wavelength lambda, compares to the number of users n. In networks with sqrt/lambda &lt; sqrt, the limitation in spatial degrees of freedom does not allow to achieve a capacity scaling better than sqrt and this performance can be readily achieved by multi-hopping. This result has been recently shown by Franceschetti et al. However, for networks with sqrt/lambda &gt; sqrt, the number of available degrees of freedom is min(n, sqrt/lambda), larger that what can be achieved by multi-hopping. We show that the optimal capacity scaling in this regime is achieved by hierarchical cooperation. In particular, in networks with sqrt/lambda&gt; n, hierarchical cooperation can achieve linear scaling.',

We propose a hypergraph model of the wideband multipath fading relay channel, and show that its min-cut is achieved by a non-coherent peaky frequency binning scheme. The so-obtained lower bound on the capacity of the wideband multipath fading relay channel turns out to coincide with the block-Markov lower bound on the capacity of the wideband frequency-division Gaussian (FD-AWGN) relay channel.

	{'abstract': u'An important challenge in constraint programming is to rewrite constraint models into executable programs calculat- ing the solutions. This phase of constraint processing may require translations between constraint programming lan- guages, transformations of constraint representations, model optimizations, and tuning of solving strategies. In this paper, we introduce a pivot metamodel describing the common fea- tures of constraint models including different kinds of con- straints, statements like conditionals and loops, and other first-class elements like object classes and predicates. This metamodel is general enough to cope with the constructions of many languages, from object-oriented modeling languages to logic languages, but it is independent from them. The rewriting operations manipulate metamodel instances apart from languages. As a consequence, the rewriting operations apply whatever languages are selected and they are able to manage model semantic information. A bridge is created between the metamodel space and languages using parsing techniques. Tools from the software engineering world can be useful to implement this framework.',

	{'abstract': u'We consider a binary erasure version of the n-channel multiple descriptions problem with symmetric descriptions, i.e., the rates of the n descriptions are the same and the distortion constraint depends only on the number of messages received. We consider the case where there is no excess rate for every k out of n descriptions. Our goal is to characterize the achievable distortions D_1, D_2,...,D_n. We measure the fidelity of reconstruction using two distortion criteria: an average-case distortion criterion, under which distortion is measured by taking the average of the per-letter distortion over all source sequences, and a worst-case distortion criterion, under which distortion is measured by taking the maximum of the per-letter distortion over all source sequences. We present achievability schemes, based on random binning for average-case distortion and systematic MDS (maximum distance separable) codes for worst-case distortion, and prove optimality results for the corresponding achievable distortion regions. We then use the binary erasure multiple descriptions setup to propose a layered coding framework for multiple descriptions, which we then apply to vector Gaussian multiple descriptions and prove its optimality for symmetric scalar Gaussian multiple descriptions with two levels of receivers and no excess rate for the central receiver. We also prove a new outer bound for the general multi-terminal source coding problem and use it to prove an optimality result for the robust binary erasure CEO problem. For the latter, we provide a tight lower bound on the distortion for ell messages for any coding scheme that achieves the minimum achievable distortion for k messages where k is less than or equal to ell.',

	{'abstract': u'Quantum computers theoretically are able to solve certain problems more quickly than any deterministic or probabilistic computers. A quantum computer exploits the rules of quantum mechanics to speed up computations. However, one has to mitigate the resulting noise and decoherence effects to avoid computational errors in order to successfully build quantum computers. In this paper, we construct asymmetric quantum codes to protect quantum information over asymmetric quantum channels, . Two generic methods are presented to derive asymmetric quantum cyclic codes using the generator polynomials and defining sets of classical cyclic codes. Consequently, the methods allow us to construct several families of quantum BCH, RS, and RM codes over asymmetric quantum channels. Finally, the methods are used to construct families of asymmetric subsystem codes.',

	{'abstract': u"Femtocells are assuming an increasingly important role in the coverage and capacity of cellular networks. In contrast to existing cellular systems, femtocells are end-user deployed and controlled, randomly located, and rely on third party backhaul (e.g. DSL or cable modem). Femtocells can be configured to be either open access or closed access. Open access allows an arbitrary nearby cellular user to use the femtocell, whereas closed access restricts the use of the femtocell to users explicitly approved by the owner. Seemingly, the network operator would prefer an open access deployment since this provides an inexpensive way to expand their network capabilities, whereas the femtocell owner would prefer closed access, in order to keep the femtocell's capacity and backhaul to himself. We show mathematically and through simulations that the reality is more complicated for both parties, and that the best approach depends heavily on whether the multiple access scheme is orthogonal (TDMA or OFDMA, per subband) or non-orthogonal (CDMA). In a TDMA/OFDMA network, closed-access is typically preferable at high user densities, whereas in CDMA, open access can provide gains of more than 200% for the home user by reducing the near-far problem experienced by the femtocell. The results of this paper suggest that the interests of the femtocell owner and the network operator are more compatible than typically believed, and that CDMA femtocells should be configured for open access whereas OFDMA or TDMA femtocells should adapt to the cellular user density.",

These programs are mapped to executable models to calculate the solutions. This paper focuses on efficient model management (definition and transformation). From this point of view, we propose to revisit the design of constraint-programming systems. A model-driven architecture is introduced to map solving-independent constraint models to solving-dependent decision models. Several important questions are examined, such as the need for a visual highlevel modeling language, and the quality of metamodeling techniques to implement the transformations. A main result is the s-COMMA platform that efficiently implements the chain from modeling to solving constraint problems',

	{'abstract': u'The Plan Execution Interchange Language (PLEXIL) is a synchronous language developed by NASA to support autonomous spacecraft operations. In this paper, we propose a rewriting logic semantics of PLEXIL in Maude, a high-performance logical engine. The rewriting logic semantics is by itself a formal interpreter of the language and can be used as a semantic benchmark for the implementation of PLEXIL executives. The implementation in Maude has the additional benefit of making available to PLEXIL designers and developers all the formal analysis and verification tools provided by Maude. The formalization of the PLEXIL semantics in rewriting logic poses an interesting challenge due to the synchronous nature of the language and the prioritized rules defining its semantics. To overcome this difficulty, we propose a general procedure for simulating synchronous set relations in rewriting logic that is sound and, for deterministic relations, complete. We also report on two issues at the design level of the original PLEXIL semantics that were identified with the help of the executable specification in Maude.',

We give various characterisations of reverse SB, showing that forward steps do not add extra power. We strengthen Bednarczyk's result that, in the absence of auto-concurrency, reverse IB is as strong as HH bisimulation, by showing that we need only exclude auto-concurrent events at the same depth in the configuration.",

	{'abstract': u'Reactive systems (RSs) represent a meta-framework aimed at deriving behavioral congruences for those computational formalisms whose operational semantics is provided by reduction rules. RSs proved a flexible specification device, yet so far most of the efforts dealing with their behavioural semantics focused on idem pushouts (IPOs) and saturated (also known as dynamic) bisimulations. In this paper we introduce a novel, intermediate behavioural equivalence: L-bisimilarity, which is able to recast both its IPO and saturated counterparts. The equivalence is parametric with respect to a set L of RSs labels, and it is shown that under mild conditions on L it is indeed a congruence. Furthermore, L-bisimilarity can also recast the notion of barbed semantics for RSs, proposed by the same authors in a previous paper. In order to provide a suitable test-bed, we instantiate our proposal by addressing the semantics of (asynchronous) CCS and of the calculus of mobile ambients.',

	{'abstract': u'We present a symbolic transition system and bisimulation equivalence for psi-calculi, and show that it is fully abstract with respect to bisimulation congruence in the non-symbolic semantics. A psi-calculus is an extension of the pi-calculus with nominal data types for data structures and for logical assertions representing facts about data. These can be transmitted between processes and their names can be statically scoped using the standard pi-calculus mechanism to allow for scope migrations. Psi-calculi can be more general than other proposed extensions of the pi-calculus such as the applied pi-calculus, the spi-calculus, the fusion calculus, or the concurrent constraint pi-calculus. Symbolic semantics are necessary for an efficient implementation of the calculus in automated tools exploring state spaces, and the full abstraction property means the semantics of a process does not change from the original.',

The method is inspired by de Simone's FH-bisimilarity and uses transition rules as schematic transitions in a bisimulation-like relation between open terms. The soundness of the method is proven and examples showing its applicability are provided.

	{'abstract': u'PageRank is a Web page ranking technique that has been a fundamental ingredient in the development and success of the Google search engine. The method is still one of the many signals that Google uses to determine which pages are most important. The main idea behind PageRank is to determine the importance of a Web page in terms of the importance assigned to the pages hyperlinking to it. In fact, this thesis is not new, and has been previously successfully exploited in different contexts. We review the PageRank method and link it to some renowned previous techniques that we have found in the fields of Web information retrieval, bibliometrics, sociometry, and econometrics.',

Blooms taxonomy classifies cognitive domain into six dynamic levels such as Knowledge at base level to Comprehension, Application, Analysis, Synthesis and Evaluation at the highest level in the order of increasing complexity. A case study indicated in this paper is a gira system, which is a gprs based Intranet Remote Administration which monitors and controls the intranet from a mobile device. This paper investigates from this case study that the System Design stage in Software Engineering uses all the six levels of Blooms Taxonomy. The application of the highest levels of Blooms Taxonomy such as Synthesis and Evaluation in the design of gira indicates that Software Design in Software Development Life Cycle is a complex and critical cognitive process.',

	{'abstract': u'The design and development of a complex system requires an adequate methodology and efficient instrumental support in order to early detect and correct anomalies in the functional and non-functional properties of the tested protocols. Among the various tools used to provide experimental support for such developments, network emulation relies on real-time production of impairments on real traffic according to a communication model, either realistically or not. This paper aims at simply presenting to newcomers in network emulation (students, engineers, ...) basic principles and practices illustrated with a few commonly used tools. The motivation behind is to fill a gap in terms of introductory and pragmatic papers in this domain. The study particularly considers centralized approaches, allowing cheap and easy implementation in the context of research labs or industrial developments. In addition, an architectural model for emulation systems is proposed, defining three complementary levels, namely hardware, impairment and model levels. With the help of this architectural framework, various existing tools are situated and described. Various approaches for modeling the emulation actions are studied, such as impairment-based scenarios and virtual architectures, real-time discrete simulation and trace-based systems. Those modeling approaches are described and compared in terms of services and we study their ability to respond to various designer needs to assess when emulation is needed.',

	{'abstract': u"This paper develops a distributed algorithm for rate allocation in wireless networks that achieves the same throughput region as optimal centralized algorithms. This cross-layer algorithm jointly performs medium access control (MAC) and physical-layer rate adaptation. The paper establishes that this algorithm is throughput-optimal for general rate regions. In contrast to on-off scheduling, rate allocation enables optimal utilization of physical-layer schemes by scheduling multiple rate levels. The algorithm is based on local queue-length information, and thus the algorithm is of significant practical value. The algorithm requires that each link can determine the global feasibility of increasing its current data-rate. In many classes of networks, any one link's data-rate primarily impacts its neighbors and this impact decays with distance. Hence, local exchanges can provide the information needed to determine feasibility. Along these lines, the paper discusses the potential use of existing physical-layer control messages to determine feasibility. This can be considered as a technique analogous to carrier sensing in CSMA (Carrier Sense Multiple Access) networks. An important application of this algorithm is in multiple-band multiple-radio throughput-optimal distributed scheduling for white-space networks.",

GSO is a new state-of-the-art algorithm that has gained some notoriety, consequently providing an excellent yardstick for measuring the performance of other algorithms. CFO is a novel deterministic metaheuristic that has performed well against GSO in previous tests. The CFO implementation reported here includes architectural improvements in errant probe retrieval and decision space adaptation that result in even better performance. Detailed results are provided for the twenty-three function benchmark suite used to evaluate GSO. CFO performs better than or essentially as well as GSO on twenty functions and nearly as well on one of the remaining three. Includes update 24 February 2010.',

	{'abstract': u'This paper proposes a multimodal biometric system through Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) for face and ear biometrics with belief fusion of the estimated scores characterized by Gabor responses and the proposed fusion is accomplished by Dempster-Shafer (DS) decision theory. Face and ear images are convolved with Gabor wavelet filters to extracts spatially enhanced Gabor facial features and Gabor ear features. Further, GMM is applied to the high-dimensional Gabor face and Gabor ear responses separately for quantitive measurements. Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm is used to estimate density parameters in GMM. This produces two sets of feature vectors which are then fused using Dempster-Shafer theory. Experiments are conducted on multimodal database containing face and ear images of 400 individuals. It is found that use of Gabor wavelet filters along with GMM and DS theory can provide robust and efficient multimodal fusion strategy.',

We explore the power of negative interactions with irreversible attachments, and we achieve two main results. Our first result is an impossibility theorem: after t steps of assembly, Omega(t) tiles will be forever bound to an assembly, unable to detach. Thus negative glue strengths do not afford unlimited power to reuse tiles. Our second result is a positive one: we construct a set of tiles that can simulate a Turing machine with space bound s and time bound t, while ensuring that no intermediate assembly grows larger than O(s), rather than O(s * t) as required by the standard Turing machine simulation with tiles.',

	{'abstract': u'Autonomic management can improve the QoS provided by parallel/ distributed applications. Within the CoreGRID Component Model, the autonomic management is tailored to the automatic - monitoring-driven - alteration of the component assembly and, therefore, is defined as the effect of (distributed) management code. This work yields a semantics based on hypergraph rewriting suitable to model the dynamic evolution and non-functional aspects of Service Oriented Architectures and component-based autonomic applications. In this regard, our main goal is to provide a formal description of adaptation operations that are typically only informally specified. We contend that our approach makes easier to raise the level of abstraction of management code in autonomic and adaptive applications.',

	{'abstract': u'We propose a blind interference alignment scheme for the vector broadcast channel where the transmitter is equipped with M antennas and there are K receivers, each equipped with a reconfigurable antenna capable of switching among M preset modes. Without any knowledge of the channel coefficient values at the transmitters and with only mild assumptions on the channel coherence structure we show that MK/M+K-1 degrees of freedom are achievable. The key to the blind interference alignment scheme is the ability of the receivers to switch between reconfigurable antenna modes to create short term channel fluctuation patterns that are exploited by the transmitter. The achievable scheme does not require cooperation between transmit antennas and is therefore applicable to the MxK X network as well. Only finite symbol extensions are used, and no channel knowledge at the receivers is required to null the interference.',

	{'abstract': u'Multicast transmission, wherein the same packet must be delivered to multiple receivers, is an important aspect of sensor and tactical networks and has several distinctive traits as opposed to more commonly studied unicast networks. Specially, these include (i) identical packets must be delivered successfully to several nodes, (ii) outage at any receiver requires the packet to be retransmitted at least to that receiver, and (iii) the multicast rate is dominated by the receiver with the weakest link in order to minimize outage and retransmission. A first contribution of this paper is the development of a tractable multicast model and throughput metric that captures each of these key traits in a multicast wireless network. We utilize a Poisson cluster process (PCP) consisting of a distinct Poisson point process (PPP) for the transmitters and receivers, and then define the multicast transmission capacity (MTC) as the maximum achievable multicast rate per transmission attempt times the maximum intensity of multicast clusters under decoding delay and multicast outage constraints. A multicast cluster is a contiguous area over which a packet is multicasted, and to reduce outage it can be tessellated into smaller regions of multicast. The second contribution of the paper is the analysis of several key aspects of this model, for which we develop the following main result. Assuming transmission attempts are allowed for each tessellated region in a multicast cluster, we show that the MTC is where , and are functions of and depending on the network size and intensity, and is the average number of the intended receivers in a cluster. We derive for a number of regimes of interest, and also show that an appropriate number of retransmissions can significantly enhance the MTC.',

Basically, the project is based on terms of the department "Strategy Technology &amp; Innovation", where it has been done. Also you can find here how the radar industry can act with the problem engendered by wind farms. The current strategies in this area are presented, such as a wind turbine production, improvements of air traffic handling procedures and the collaboration between developers of radars and wind turbines. The possible strategy for Thales as a main pioneer was given as well.',

	{'abstract': u'The fundamental principle underlying compressed sensing is that a signal, which is sparse under some basis representation, can be recovered from a small number of linear measurements. However, prior knowledge of the sparsity basis is essential for the recovery process. This work introduces the concept of blind compressed sensing, which avoids the need to know the sparsity basis in both the sampling and the recovery process. We suggest three possible constraints on the sparsity basis that can be added to the problem in order to make its solution unique. For each constraint we prove conditions for uniqueness, and suggest a simple method to retrieve the solution. Under the uniqueness conditions, and as long as the signals are sparse enough, we demonstrate through simulations that without knowing the sparsity basis our methods can achieve results similar to those of standard compressed sensing, which relay on prior knowledge of the sparsity basis. This offers a general sampling and reconstruction system that fits all sparse signals, regardless of the sparsity basis, under the conditions and constraints presented in this work.',

In particular, we study the problem of removing as many local extrema (minima and maxima) as possible from the terrain. We show that removing only minima or only maxima can be done optimally in O(n log n) time, for a terrain with n vertices. Interestingly, however, removing both the minima and maxima simultaneously is NP-hard, and is even hard to approximate within a factor of O(log log n) unless P=NP. Moreover, we show that even a simplified version of the problem where vertices can have only two different heights is already NP-hard, a result we obtain by proving hardness of a special case of 2-Disjoint Connected Subgraphs, a problem that has lately received considerable attention from the graph-algorithms community.',

	{'abstract': u"Fixed point combinators (and their generalization: looping combinators) are classic notions belonging to the heart of lambda-calculus and logic. We start with an exploration of the structure of fixed point combinators (fpc's), vastly generalizing the well-known fact that if Y is an fpc, Y(SI) is again an fpc, generating the Boehm sequence of fpc's. Using the infinitary lambda-calculus we devise infinitely many other generation schemes for fpc's. In this way we find schemes and building blocks to construct new fpc's in a modular way. Having created a plethora of new fixed point combinators, the task is to prove that they are indeed new. That is, we have to prove their beta-inconvertibility. Known techniques via Boehm Trees do not apply, because all fpc's have the same Boehm Tree (BT). Therefore, we employ `clocked BT's', with annotations that convey information of the tempo in which the data in the BT are produced. BT's are thus enriched with an intrinsic clock behaviour, leading to a refined discrimination method for lambda-terms. The corresponding equality is strictly intermediate between beta-convertibility and BT-equality, the equality in the classical models of lambda-calculus. An analogous approach pertains to Levy-Longo Berarducci trees. Finally, we increase the discrimination power by a precision of the clock notion that we call `atomic clock'.",

	{'abstract': u'Human users have a tough time remembering long cryptographic keys. Hence, researchers, for so long, have been examining ways to utilize biometric features of the user instead of a memorable password or passphrase, in an effort to generate strong and repeatable cryptographic keys. Our objective is to incorporate the volatility of the users biometric features into the generated key, so as to make the key unguessable to an attacker lacking significant knowledge of the users biometrics. We go one step further trying to incorporate multiple biometric modalities into cryptographic key generation so as to provide better security. In this article, we propose an efficient approach based on multimodal biometrics (Iris and fingerprint) for generation of secure cryptographic key. The proposed approach is composed of three modules namely, 1) Feature extraction, 2) Multimodal biometric template generation and 3) Cryptographic key generation. Initially, the features, minutiae points and texture properties are extracted from the fingerprint and iris images respectively. Subsequently, the extracted features are fused together at the feature level to construct the multibiometric template. Finally, a 256bit secure cryptographic key is generated from the multibiometric template. For experimentation, we have employed the fingerprint images obtained from publicly available sources and the iris images from CASIA Iris Database. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.',

	{'abstract': u'The aim of this paper is to study the fusion at feature extraction level for face and fingerprint biometrics. The proposed approach is based on the fusion of the two traits by extracting independent feature pointsets from the two modalities, and making the two pointsets compatible for concatenation. Moreover, to handle the problem of curse of dimensionality, the feature pointsets are properly reduced in dimension. Different feature reduction techniques are implemented, prior and after the feature pointsets fusion, and the results are duly recorded. The fused feature pointset for the database and the query face and fingerprint images are matched using techniques based on either the point pattern matching, or the Delaunay triangulation. Comparative experiments are conducted on chimeric and real databases, to assess the actual advantage of the fusion performed at the feature extraction level, in comparison to the matching score level.',

	{'abstract': u"The existing literature on optimal auctions focuses on optimizing the expected revenue of the seller, and is appropriate for risk-neutral sellers. In this paper, we identify good mechanisms for risk-averse sellers. As is standard in the economics literature, we model the risk-aversion of a seller by endowing the seller with a monotone concave utility function. We then seek robust mechanisms that are approximately optimal for all sellers, no matter what their levels of risk-aversion are. We have two main results for multi-unit auctions with unit-demand bidders whose valuations are drawn i.i.d. from a regular distribution. First, we identify a posted-price mechanism called the Hedge mechanism, which gives a universal constant factor approximation; we also show for the unlimited supply case that this mechanism is in a sense the best possible. Second, we show that the VCG mechanism gives a universal constant factor approximation when the number of bidders is even only a small multiple of the number of items. Along the way we point out that Myerson's characterization of the optimal mechanisms fails to extend to utility-maximization for risk-averse sellers, and establish interesting properties of regular distributions and monotone hazard rate distributions.",

	{'abstract': u'The list update problem is a classical online problem, with an optimal competitive ratio that is still open, known to be somewhere between 1.5 and 1.6. An algorithm with competitive ratio 1.6, the smallest known to date, is COMB, a randomized combination of BIT and the TIMESTAMP algorithm TS. This and almost all other list update algorithms, like MTF, are projective in the sense that they can be defined by looking only at any pair of list items at a time. Projectivity (also known as "list factoring") simplifies both the description of the algorithm and its analysis, and so far seems to be the only way to define a good online algorithm for lists of arbitrary length. In this paper we characterize all projective list update algorithms and show that their competitive ratio is never smaller than 1.6 in the partial cost model. Therefore, COMB is a best possible projective algorithm in this model.',

	{'abstract': u'Recently an alternative of DDoS attacks called shrew attacks or Reduction of Quality (RoQ) has been identified which is very much difficult to detect. The RoQ attacks can use source and destination IP address spoofing, and they do not have distinct periodicity, and may not filter the attack packets precisely. In this paper, we propose to design the MAC layer based defense architecture for RoQ attacks in Wireless LAN which includes the detection and response stages. The attackers are detected by checking the RTS CTS packets from the MAC layer and the corresponding attack flows are blocked or rejected. By our simulation results, we show that our proposed technique achieves reduces the attack throughput there by increasing the received bandwidth and reducing the packet loss of legitimate users.',

	{'abstract': u'Networks on Chip is a recent solution paradigm adopted to increase the performance of Multicore designs. The key idea is to interconnect various computation modules (IP cores) in a network fashion and transport packets simultaneously across them, thereby gaining performance. In addition to improving performance by having multiple packets in flight, NoCs also present a host of other advantages including scalability, power efficiency, and component reuse through modular design. This work focuses on design and development of high performance communication architectures for FPGAs using NoCs Once completely developed, the above methodology could be used to augment the current FPGA design flow for implementing multicore SoC applications. We design and implement an NoC framework for FPGAs, MultiClock OnChip Network for Reconfigurable Systems (MoCReS). We propose a novel microarchitecture for a hybrid two layer router that supports both packetswitched communications, across its local and directional ports, as well as, time multiplexed circuitswitched communications among the multiple IP cores directly connected to it. Results from place and route VHDL models of the advanced router architecture show an average improvement of 20.4 percent in NoC bandwidth (maximum of 24 percent compared to a traditional NoC). We parameterize the hybrid router model over the number of ports, channel width and bRAM depth and develop a library of network components (MoClib Library).

	{'abstract': u'A Previously traditional methods were sufficient to protect the information, since it is simplicity in the past does not need complicated methods but with the progress of information technology, it become easy to attack systems, and detection of encryption methods became necessary to find ways parallel with the differing methods used by hackers, so the embedding methods could be under surveillance from system managers in an organization that requires the high level of security. This fact requires researches on new hiding methods and cover objects which hidden information is embedded in. It is the result from the researches to embed information in executable files, but when will use the executable file for cover they have many challenges must be taken into consideration which is any changes made to the file will be firstly detected by untie viruses, secondly the functionality of the file is not still functioning. In this paper, a new information hiding system is presented. The aim of the proposed system is to hide information (data file) within image page of execution file (EXEfile) to make sure changes made to the file will not be detected by universe and the functionality of the exe.file is still functioning after hiding process. Meanwhile, since the cover file might be used to identify hiding information, the proposed system considers overcoming this dilemma by using the execution file as a cover file.',

	{'abstract': u'Teleophthalmology holds a great potential to improve the quality, access, and affordability in health care. For patients, it can reduce the need for travel and provide the access to a superspecialist. Ophthalmology lends itself easily to telemedicine as it is a largely image based diagnosis. The main goal of the proposed system is to diagnose the type of disease in the retina and to automatically detect and segment retinal diseases without human supervision or interaction. The proposed system will diagnose the disease present in the retina using a neural network based classifier.The extent of the disease spread in the retina can be identified by extracting the textural features of the retina. This system will diagnose the following type of diseases: Diabetic Retinopathy and Drusen.',

	{'abstract': u'Initially TCP was designed with the notion in mind that wired networks are generally reliable and any segment loss in a transmission is due to congestion in the network rather than an unreliable medium (The assumptions is that the packet loss caused by damage is much less than 1 percent) . This notion doesnt hold in wireless parts of the network. Wireless links are highly unreliable and they lose segments all the time due to a number of factors. Very few papers are available which uses TCP for MANET. In this paper, an attempt have been made to justify the use of TCP variants (Tahoe and Reno) for loss of packet due to random noise introduces in the MANET. For the present analysis the simulation has been carried out for TCP variants (Tahoe and Reno) by introduces 0, 10, 20 and 30 percent noise. The comparison of TCP variants is made by running simulation for 0, 10, 20 and 30 percent of data packet loss due to noise in the transmission link and the effect of throughput and congestion window has been examined. During the simulation we have observed that throughput has been decreased when a drop of multiple segments happens, further we have observed in the case of TCP variant (Reno) throughput is better at 1 percent (Figure 5) which implies a network with short burst of error and low BER, causing only one segment to be lost. When multiple segments are lost due to error prone nature of link, Tahoe perform better than Reno (Figure 13), that gives a significant saving of time (64.28 percent) in comparison with Reno (Table 4). Several simulations have been run with ns 2 simulator in order to acquire a better understanding of these TCP variants and the way they perform their function. We conclude with a discussion of whether these TCP versions can be used in Mobile Ad hoc Network.',

	{'abstract': u'As passive optical networks (PON) are increasingly deployed to provide high speed Internet access, it is important to understand their fundamental traffic capacity limits. The paper discusses performance models applicable to wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) EPONs and GPONs under the assumption that users access the fibre via optical network units equipped with tunable transmitters. The considered stochastic models are based on multiserver polling systems for which explicit analytical results are not known. A large system asymptotic, mean-field approximation, is used to derive closed form solutions of these complex systems. Convergence of the mean field dynamics is proved in the case of a simple network configuration. Simulation results show that, for a realistic sized PON, the mean field approximation is accurate.',

	{'abstract': u'Passive optical networks are increasingly used for access to the Internet and it is important to understand the performance of future long-reach, multi-channel variants. In this paper we discuss requirements on the dynamic bandwidth allocation (DBA) algorithm used to manage the upstream resource in a WDM EPON and propose a simple novel DBA algorithm that is considerably more efficient than classical approaches. We demonstrate that the algorithm emulates a multi-server polling system and derive capacity formulas that are valid for general traffic processes. We evaluate delay performance by simulation demonstrating the superiority of the proposed scheduler. The proposed scheduler offers considerable flexibility and is particularly efficient in long-reach access networks where propagation times are high.',

	{'abstract': u'Online advertising is currently the greatest source of revenue for many Internet giants. The increased number of specialized websites and modern profiling techniques, have all contributed to an explosion of the income of ad brokers from online advertising. The single biggest threat to this growth, is however, click-fraud. Trained botnets and even individuals are hired by click-fraud specialists in order to maximize the revenue of certain users from the ads they publish on their websites, or to launch an attack between competing businesses. In this note we wish to raise the awareness of the networking research community on potential research areas within this emerging field. As an example strategy, we present Bluff ads; a class of ads that join forces in order to increase the effort level for click-fraud spammers. Bluff ads are either targeted ads, with irrelevant display text, or highly relevant display text, with irrelevant targeting information. They act as a litmus test for the legitimacy of the individual clicking on the ads. Together with standard threshold-based methods, fake ads help to decrease click-fraud levels.',

	{'abstract': u'We study a novel class of mechanism design problems in which the outcomes are constrained by the payments. This basic class of mechanism design problems captures many common economic situations, and yet it has not been studied, to our knowledge, in the past. We focus on the case of procurement auctions in which sellers have private costs, and the auctioneer aims to maximize a utility function on subsets of items, under the constraint that the sum of the payments provided by the mechanism does not exceed a given budget. Standard mechanism design ideas such as the VCG mechanism and its variants are not applicable here. We show that, for general functions, the budget constraint can render mechanisms arbitrarily bad in terms of the utility of the buyer. However, our main result shows that for the important class of submodular functions, a bounded approximation ratio is achievable. Better approximation results are obtained for subclasses of the submodular functions. We explore the space of budget feasible mechanisms in other domains and give a characterization under more restricted conditions.',

Soon it will be extended to other operators. However, unless telecommunication operators can directly benefit from allowing a user to switch to another operator, operators have an incentive to keep their network quality of service confidential to avoid that their users decide to switch to another network. In contrast, in a user-centric way, the users should be allowed to share their observations regarding the networks that they have used. In this paper, we present our work in progress towards attack-resistant sharing of quality of service information and network provider reputation among mobile users.',

	{'abstract': u'Motivated by linear network coding, communication channels perform linear operation over finite fields, namely linear operator channels (LOCs), are studied in this paper. For such a channel, its output vector is a linear transform of its input vector, and the transformation matrix is randomly and independently generated. The transformation matrix is assumed to remain constant for every T input vectors and to be unknown to both the transmitter and the receiver. There are NO constraints on the distribution of the transformation matrix and the field size. Specifically, the optimality of subspace coding over LOCs is investigated. A lower bound on the maximum achievable rate of subspace coding is obtained and it is shown to be tight for some cases. The maximum achievable rate of constant-dimensional subspace coding is characterized and the loss of rate incurred by using constant-dimensional subspace coding is insignificant. The maximum achievable rate of channel training is close to the lower bound on the maximum achievable rate of subspace coding. Two coding approaches based on channel training are proposed and their performances are evaluated. Our first approach makes use of rank-metric codes and its optimality depends on the existence of maximum rank distance codes. Our second approach applies linear coding and it can achieve the maximum achievable rate of channel training. Our code designs require only the knowledge of the expectation of the rank of the transformation matrix. The second scheme can also be realized ratelessly without a priori knowledge of the channel statistics.',

	{'abstract': u'The basic goal in combinatorial group testing is to identify a set of up to defective items within a large population of size using a pooling strategy. Namely, the items can be grouped together in pools, and a single measurement would reveal whether there are one or more defectives in the pool. The threshold model is a generalization of this idea where a measurement returns positive if the number of defectives in the pool reaches a fixed threshold , negative if this number is no more than a fixed lower threshold , and may behave arbitrarily otherwise. We study non-adaptive threshold group testing (in a possibly noisy setting) and show that, for this problem, measurements (where and is any fixed constant) suffice to identify the defectives, and also present almost matching lower bounds. This significantly improves the previously known (non-constructive) upper bound . Moreover, we obtain a framework for explicit construction of measurement schemes using lossless condensers. The number of measurements resulting from this scheme is ideally bounded by . Using state-of-the-art constructions of lossless condensers, however, we obtain explicit testing schemes with and measurements, for arbitrary constant .',

While abstract transfer functions are still rather inexpensive and accurate even for interpreting non-linear computations, we are able to also interpret tests (i.e. intersections) efficiently. This fixes a known drawback of zonotopic methods, as used for reachability analysis for hybrid sys- tems as well as for invariant generation in abstract interpretation: intersection of zonotopes are not always zonotopes, and there is not even a best zonotopic over-approximation of the intersection. We describe some examples and an im- plementation of our method in the APRON library, and discuss some further in- teresting combinations of zonotopes with non-linear or non-convex domains such as quadratic templates and maxplus polyhedra.',

	{'abstract': u'Exact String Matching is an essential issue in many computer science applications. Unfortunately, the performance of Exact String Matching algorithms, namely, executing time, does not address the needs of these applications. This paper proposes a general platform for improving the existing Exact String Matching algorithms executing time, called the PXSMAlg platform. The function of this platform is to parallelize the Exact String Matching algorithms using the MPI model over the Master or Slaves paradigms. The PXSMAlg platform parallelization process is done by dividing the Text into several parts and working on these parts simultaneously. This improves the executing time of the Exact String Matching algorithms. We have simulated the PXSMAlg platform in order to show its competence, through applying the Quick Search algorithm on the PXSMAlg platform. The simulation result showed significant improvement in the Quick Search executing time, and therefore extreme competence in the PXSMAlg platform.',

The advantage of this algorithm over traditional ones is that the complex conversion process from regular expressions to finite automata is not needed.

	{'abstract': u'Currently, criminals profile (CP) is obtained from investigators or forensic psychologists interpretation, linking crime scene characteristics and an offenders behavior to his or her characteristics and psychological profile. This paper seeks an efficient and systematic discovery of nonobvious and valuable patterns between variables from a large database of solved cases via a probabilistic network (PN) modeling approach. The PN structure can be used to extract behavioral patterns and to gain insight into what factors influence these behaviors. Thus, when a new case is being investigated and the profile variables are unknown because the offender has yet to be identified, the observed crime scene variables are used to infer the unknown variables based on their connections in the structure and the corresponding numerical (probabilistic) weights. The objective is to produce a more systematic and empirical approach to profiling, and to use the resulting PN model as a decision tool.',

	{'abstract': u'The explosive growth of spatial data and extensive utilization of spatial databases emphasize the necessity for the automated discovery of spatial knowledge. In modern times, spatial data mining has emerged as an area of voluminous research. Forest fires are a chief environmental concern, causing economical and ecological damage while endangering human lives across the world. The fast or early detection of forest fires is a vital element for controlling such phenomenon. The application of remote sensing is at present a significant method for forest fires monitoring, particularly in vast and remote areas. Different methods have been presented by researchers for forest fire detection. The motivation behind this research is to obtain beneficial information from images in the forest spatial data and use the same in the determination of regions at the risk of fires by utilizing Image Processing and Artificial Intelligence techniques. This paper presents an intelligent system to detect the presence of forest fires in the forest spatial data using Artificial Neural Networks. The digital images in the forest spatial data are converted from RGB to XYZ color space and then segmented by employing anisotropic diffusion to identify the fire regions. Subsequently, Radial Basis Function Neural Network is employed in the design of the intelligent system, which is trained with the color space values of the segmented fire regions. Extensive experimental assessments on publicly available spatial data illustrated the efficiency of the proposed system in effectively detecting forest fires.',

	{'abstract': u'Software testing is the important phase of software development process. But, this phase can be easily missed by software developers because of their limited time to complete the project. Since, software developers finish their software nearer to the delivery time; they dont get enough time to test their program by creating effective test cases. . One of the major difficulties in software testing is the generation of test cases that satisfy the given adequacy criterion Moreover, creating manual test cases is a tedious work for software developers in the final rush hours. A new approach which generates test cases can help the software developers to create test cases from software specifications in early stage of software development (before coding) and as well as from program execution traces from after software development (after coding). Heuristic techniques can be applied for creating quality test cases. Mutation testing is a technique for testing software units that has great potential for improving the quality of testing, and to assure the high reliability of software. In this paper, a mutation testing based test cases generation technique has been proposed to generate test cases from program execution trace, so that the test cases can be generated after coding. The paper details about the mutation testing implementation to generate test cases. The proposed algorithm has been demonstrated for an example.',

	{'abstract': u'With information revolution, increased globalization and competition, supply chain has become longer and more complicated than ever before. These developments bring supply chain management to the forefront of the managements attention. Inventories are very important in a supply chain. The total investment in inventories is enormous, and the management of inventory is crucial to avoid shortages or delivery delays for the customers and serious drain on a companys financial resources. The supply chain cost increases because of the influence of lead times for supplying the stocks as well as the raw materials. Practically, the lead times will not be same through out all the periods. Maintaining abundant stocks in order to avoid the impact of high lead time increases the holding cost. Similarly, maintaining fewer stocks because of ballpark lead time may lead to shortage of stocks. This also happens in the case of lead time involved in supplying raw materials. A better optimization methodology that utilizes the Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm, one of the best optimization algorithms, is proposed to overcome the impasse in maintaining the optimal stock levels in each member of the supply chain. Taking into account the stock levels thus obtained from the proposed methodology, an appropriate stock levels to be maintained in the approaching periods that will minimize the supply chain inventory cost can be arrived at.',

	{'abstract': u'Inventory management is considered to be an important field in Supply Chain Management because the cost of inventories in a supply chain accounts for about 30 percent of the value of the product. The service provided to the customer eventually gets enhanced once the efficient and effective management of inventory is carried out all through the supply chain. The precise estimation of optimal inventory is essential since shortage of inventory yields to lost sales, while excess of inventory may result in pointless storage costs. Thus the determination of the inventory to be held at various levels in a supply chain becomes inevitable so as to ensure minimal cost for the supply chain. The minimization of the total supply chain cost can only be achieved when optimization of the base stock level is carried out at each member of the supply chain. This paper deals with the problem of determination of base stock levels in a ten member serial supply chain with multiple products produced by factories using Uniform Crossover Genetic Algorithms. The complexity of the problem increases when more distribution centers and agents and multiple products were involved. These considerations leading to very complex inventory management process has been resolved in this work.',

ClusterHead chosen is a important thing for clustering in adhoc networks. So, we have shown the optimization technique for the minimization of ClusterHeads(CH) based on some parameter such as degree difference, Battery power (Pv), degree of mobility, and sum of the distances of a node in adhoc networks. ClusterHeads selection of adhoc networks is an important thing for clustering. Here, we have discussed the performance comparison between deterministic approach and GA based approach. In this performance comparison, we have seen that GA does not always give the good result compare to deterministic WCA algorithm. Here we have seen connectivity (connectivity can be measured by the probability that a node is reachable to any other node.) is better than the deterministic WCA algorithm (4).',

	{'abstract': u'With the proliferation of mobile computing devices, the demand for continuous network connectivity regardless of physical location has spurred interest in the use of mobile ad hoc networks. Since Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is the standard network protocol for communication in the internet, any wireless network with Internet service need to be compatible with TCP. TCP is tuned to perform well in traditional wired networks, where packet losses occur mostly because of congestion. However, TCP connections in Ad-hoc mobile networks are plagued by problems such as high bit error rates, frequent route changes, multipath routing and temporary network partitions. The throughput of TCP over such connection is not satisfactory, because TCP misinterprets the packet loss or delay as congestion and invokes congestion control and avoidance algorithm. In this research, the performance of TCP in Adhoc mobile network with high Bit Error rate (BER) and mobility is studied and investigated. Simulation model is implemented and experiments are performed using the Network Simulatior 2 (NS2).',

	{'abstract': u'Channel properties influence the development of wireless communication systems. Unlike wired channels that are stationary and predictable, radio channels are extremely random and dont offer easy analysis. A Radio Propagation Model (RPM), also known as the Radio Wave Propagation Model (RWPM), is an empirical mathematical formulation for the characterization of radio wave propagation as a function of frequency. In mobile radio systems, path loss models are necessary for proper planning, interference estimations, frequency assignments and cell parameters which are the basic for network planning process as well as Location Based Services (LBS) techniques. Propagation models that predict the mean signal strength for an arbitrary transmitter receiver (T R) separation distance which is useful in estimating the radio coverage area of a transmitter are called large scale propagation models, since they characterize signal strength over large TR separation distances. In this paper, the large scale propagation performance of Okumura, Hata, and Lee models has been compared varying Mobile Station (MS) antenna height, Transmitter Receiver (TR) distance and Base Station (BS) antenna height, considering the system to operate at 900 MHz. Through the MATLAB simulation it is turned out that the Okumura model shows the better performance than that of the other large scale propagation models.',

	{'abstract': u'Microcalcifications in mammogram have been mainly targeted as a reliable earliest sign of breast cancer and their early detection is vital to improve its prognosis. Since their size is very small and may be easily overlooked by the examining radiologist, computer-based detection output can assist the radiologist to improve the diagnostic accuracy. In this paper, we have proposed an algorithm for detecting microcalcification in mammogram. The proposed microcalcification detection algorithm involves mammogram quality enhancement using multirresolution analysis based on the dyadic wavelet transform and microcalcification detection by fuzzy shell clustering. It may be possible to detect nodular components such as microcalcification accurately by introducing shape information. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm for microcalcification detection is confirmed by experimental results.',

	{'abstract': u'A natural way to deal with multiple, partially conflicting objectives is turning all the objectives but one into budget constraints. Some classical polynomial-time optimization problems, such as spanning tree and forest, shortest path, (perfect) matching, independent set (basis) in a matroid or in the intersection of two matroids, become NP-hard even with one budget constraint. Still, for most of these problems deterministic and randomized polynomial-time approximation schemes are known. In the case of two or more budgets, typically only multi-criteria approximation schemes are available, which return slightly infeasible solutions. Not much is known however for the case of strict budget constraints: filling this gap is the main goal of this paper. We show that shortest path, perfect matching, and spanning tree (and hence matroid basis and matroid intersection basis) are inapproximable already with two budget constraints. For the remaining problems, whose set of solutions forms an independence system, we present deterministic and randomized polynomial-time approximation schemes for a constant number k of budget constraints. Our results are based on a variety of techniques: 1. We present a simple and powerful mechanism to transform multi-criteria approximation schemes into pure approximation schemes. 2. We show that points in low dimensional faces of any matroid polytope are almost integral, an interesting result on its own. This gives a deterministic approximation scheme for k-budgeted matroid independent set. 3. We present a deterministic approximation scheme for 2-budgeted matching. The backbone of this result is a purely topological property of curves in R^2.',

	{'abstract': u"An instance of the tollbooth problem consists of an undirected network and a collection of single-minded customers, each of which is interested in purchasing a fixed path subject to an individual budget constraint. The objective is to assign a per-unit price to each edge in a way that maximizes the collective revenue obtained from all customers. The revenue generated by any customer is equal to the overall price of the edges in her desired path, when this cost falls within her budget; otherwise, that customer will not purchase any edge. Our main result is a deterministic algorithm for the tollbooth problem on trees whose approximation ratio is O(log m / log log m), where m denotes the number of edges in the underlying graph. This finding improves on the currently best performance guarantees for trees, due to Elbassioni et al. (SAGT '09), as well as for paths (commonly known as the highway problem), due to Balcan and Blum (EC '06). An additional interesting consequence is a computational separation between tollbooth pricing on trees and the original prototype problem of single-minded unlimited supply pricing, under a plausible hardness hypothesis due to Demaine et al. (SODA '06).",

	{'abstract': u'The most expensive source of errors and the more difficult to detect in a formal development is the error during specification. Hence, the first step in a formal development usually consists in exhibiting the set of all behaviors of the specification, for instance with an automaton. Starting from this observation, many researches are about the generation of a B machine from a behavioral specification, such as UML. However, no backward verification are done. This is why, we propose the GeneSyst tool, which aims at generating an automaton describing at least all behaviors of the specification. The refinement step is considered and appears as sub-automatons in the produced SLTS.',

	{'abstract': u'Estimating intrinsic dimensionality of data is a classic problem in pattern recognition and statistics. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a powerful tool in discovering dimensionality of data sets with a linear structure; it, however, becomes ineffective when data have a nonlinear structure. In this paper, we propose a new PCA-based method to estimate intrinsic dimension of data with nonlinear structures. Our method works by first finding a minimal cover of the data set, then performing PCA locally on each subset in the cover and finally giving the estimation result by checking up the data variance on all small neighborhood regions. The proposed method utilizes the whole data set to estimate its intrinsic dimension and is convenient for incremental learning. In addition, our new PCA procedure can filter out noise in data and converge to a stable estimation with the neighborhood region size increasing. Experiments on synthetic and real world data sets show effectiveness of the proposed method.',

	{'abstract': u"We study possible formulations of algebraic propositional proof systems operating with noncommutative formulas. We observe that a simple formulation gives rise to systems at least as strong as Frege---yielding a semantic way to define a Cook-Reckhow (i.e., polynomially verifiable) algebraic analog of Frege proofs, different from that given in [BIKPRS96,GH03]. We then turn to an apparently weaker system, namely, polynomial calculus (PC) where polynomials are written as ordered formulas (PC over ordered formulas, for short): an ordered polynomial is a noncommutative polynomial in which the order of products in every monomial respects a fixed linear order on variables; an algebraic formula is ordered if the polynomial computed by each of its subformulas is ordered. We show that PC over ordered formulas is strictly stronger than resolution, polynomial calculus and polynomial calculus with resolution (PCR) and admits polynomial-size refutations for the pigeonhole principle and the Tseitin's formulas. We conclude by proposing an approach for establishing lower bounds on PC over ordered formulas proofs, and related systems, based on properties of lower bounds on noncommutative formulas. The motivation behind this work is developing techniques incorporating rank arguments (similar to those used in algebraic circuit complexity) for establishing lower bounds on propositional proofs.",

In this paper, a specific image based steganography technique for communicating information more securely between two locations is proposed. The author incorporated the idea of secret key and password security features for authentication at both ends in order to achieve high level of security. As a further improvement of security level, the information has been permuted, encoded and then finally embedded on an image to form the stego image. In addition segmented objects extraction and reassembly of the stego image through normalized cut method has been carried out at the sender side and receiver side respectively in order to prevent distortion of the Stego image during transmission.',

	{'abstract': u"Since their conception in 1975, Genetic Algorithms have been an extremely popular approach to find exact or approximate solutions to optimization and search problems. Over the last years there has been an enhanced interest in the field with related techniques, such as grammatical evolution, being developed. Unfortunately, work on developing genetic optimizations for low-end embedded architectures hasn't embraced the same enthusiasm. This short paper tackles that situation by demonstrating how genetic algorithms can be implemented in Arduino Duemilanove, a 16 MHz open-source micro-controller, with limited computation power and storage resources. As part of this short paper, the libraries used in this implementation are released into the public domain under a GPL license.",

	{'abstract': u"Recently, Guo and Xia gave sufficient conditions for an STBC to achieve full diversity when a PIC (Partial Interference Cancellation) or a PIC-SIC (PIC with Successive Interference Cancellation) decoder is used at the receiver. In this paper, we give alternative conditions for an STBC to achieve full diversity with PIC and PIC-SIC decoders, which are equivalent to Guo and Xia's conditions, but are much easier to check. Using these conditions, we construct a new class of full diversity PIC-SIC decodable codes, which contain the Toeplitz codes and a family of codes recently proposed by Zhang, Xu et. al. as proper subclasses. With the help of the new criteria, we also show that a class of PIC-SIC decodable codes recently proposed by Zhang, Shi et. al. can be decoded with much lower complexity than what is reported, without compromising on full diversity.",

	{'abstract': u"A multiple-perspective co-citation analysis method is introduced for characterizing and interpreting the structure and dynamics of co-citation clusters. The method facilitates analytic and sense making tasks by integrating network visualization, spectral clustering, automatic cluster labeling, and text summarization. Co-citation networks are decomposed into co-citation clusters. The interpretation of these clusters is augmented by automatic cluster labeling and summarization. The method focuses on the interrelations between a co-citation cluster's members and their citers. The generic method is applied to a three-part analysis of the field of Information Science as defined by 12 journals published between 1996 and 2008: 1) a comparative author co-citation analysis (ACA), 2) a progressive ACA of a time series of co-citation networks, and 3) a progressive document co-citation analysis (DCA). Results show that the multiple-perspective method increases the interpretability and accountability of both ACA and DCA networks.",

	{'abstract': u"This paper studies a family of genie-MAC (multiple access channel) outer bounds for K-user Gaussian interference channels. This family is inspired by existing genie-aided bounding mechanisms, but differs from current approaches in its optimization problem formulation and application. The fundamental idea behind these bounds is to create a group of genie receivers that form multiple access channels that can decode a subset of the original interference channel's messages. The MAC sum capacity of each of the genie receivers provides an outer bound on the sum of rates for this subset. The genie-MAC outer bounds are used to derive new sum-capacity results. In particular, this paper derives sum-capacity in closed-form for the class of K-user Gaussian degraded interference channels. The sum-capacity achieving scheme is shown to be a successive interference cancellation scheme. This result generalizes a known result for two-user channels to K-user channels.",

IEEE 802.16-2004 currently supports several multiple-antenna options including Space-Time Codes (STC), Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) antenna systems and Adaptive Antenna Systems (AAS). The most recent WiMAX standard (802.16e) supports broadband applications to mobile terminals and laptops. Using Adaptive Modulation and Coding (AMC) we analyze the performance of OFDM physical layer in WiMAX based on the simulation results of Bit Error Rate (BER), and data throughput. The performance analysis of OFDM PHY is done. In this paper, an extension to the basic SISO mode, a number of 2 by 2 MIMO extensions are analysed under different combinations of digital modulation (QPSK, 16QAM and 64QAM) and Convolutional Code (CC) with half, two-third and three quarter rated codes.

	{'abstract': u'DDR SDRAM is similar in function to the regular SDRAM but doubles the bandwidth of the memory by transferring data on both edges of the clock cycles. DDR SDRAM most commonly used in various embedded application like networking, image or video processing, Laptops ete. Now a days many applications needs more and more cheap and fast memory. Especially in the field of signal processing, requires significant amount of memory. The most used type of dynamic memory for that purpose is DDR SDRAM. For FPGA design the IC manufacturers are providing commercial memory controller IP cores working only on their products. Main disadvantage is the lack of memory access optimization for random memory access patterns. The data path part of those controllers can be used free of charge. This work propose an architecture of a DDR SDRAM controller, which takes advantage of those available and well tested data paths and can be used for any FPGA device or ASIC design.(5). In most of the SOC design, DDR SDRAM is commonly used. ARM processor is widely used in SOCs; so that we focused to implement AHB compatible DDR SDRAM controller suitable for ARM based SOC design.',

	{'abstract': u'In this paper, we propose a novel policy iteration method, called dynamic policy programming (DPP), to estimate the optimal policy in the infinite-horizon Markov decision processes. We prove the finite-iteration and asymptotic l infty-norm performance-loss bounds for DPP in the presence of approximation/estimation error. The bounds are expressed in terms of the l infty-norm of the average accumulated error as opposed to the l infty-norm of the error in the case of the standard approximate value iteration (AVI) and the approximate policy iteration (API). This suggests that DPP can achieve a better performance than AVI and API since it averages out the simulation noise caused by Monte-Carlo sampling throughout the learning process. We examine this theoretical results numerically by com- paring the performance of the approximate variants of DPP with existing reinforcement learning (RL) methods on different problem domains. Our results show that, in all cases, DPP-based algorithms outperform other RL methods by a wide margin.',

	{'abstract': u'Persistence homology is a tool used to measure topological features that are present in data sets and functions. Persistence pairs births and deaths of these features as we iterate through the sublevel sets of the data or function of interest. I am concerned with using persistence to characterize the difference between two functions f, g : M -&gt; R, where M is a topological space. Furthermore, I formulate a homotopy from g to f by applying the heat equation to the difference function g-f. By stacking the persistence diagrams associated with this homotopy, we create a vineyard of curves that connect the points in the diagram for f with the points in the diagram for g. I look at the diagrams where M is a square, a sphere, a torus, and a Klein bottle. Looking at these four topologies, we notice trends (and differences) as the persistence diagrams change with respect to time.',

	{'abstract': u'The Nystrom method is an efficient technique to speed up large-scale learning applications by generating low-rank approximations. Crucial to the performance of this technique is the assumption that a matrix can be well approximated by working exclusively with a subset of its columns. In this work we relate this assumption to the concept of matrix coherence and connect matrix coherence to the performance of the Nystrom method. Making use of related work in the compressed sensing and the matrix completion literature, we derive novel coherence-based bounds for the Nystrom method in the low-rank setting. We then present empirical results that corroborate these theoretical bounds. Finally, we present more general empirical results for the full-rank setting that convincingly demonstrate the ability of matrix coherence to measure the degree to which information can be extracted from a subset of columns.',

	{'abstract': u'We introduce a new visual analytic approach to the study of scientific discoveries and knowledge diffusion. Our approach enhances contemporary co-citation network analysis by enabling analysts to identify co-citation clusters of cited references intuitively, synthesize thematic contexts in which these clusters are cited, and trace how research focus evolves over time. The new approach integrates and streamlines a few previously isolated techniques such as spectral clustering and feature selection algorithms. The integrative procedure is expected to empower and strengthen analytical and sense making capabilities of scientists, learners, and researchers to understand the dynamics of the evolution of scientific domains in a wide range of scientific fields, science studies, and science policy evaluation and planning. We demonstrate the potential of our approach through a visual analysis of the evolution of astronomical research associated with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) using bibliographic data between 1994 and 2008. In addition, we also demonstrate that the approach can be consistently applied to a set of heterogeneous data sources such as e-prints on arXiv, publications on ADS, and NSF awards related to the same topic of SDSS.',

	{'abstract': u"Despite its obvious relevance, meaning has been outside most theoretical approaches to information in biology. As a consequence, functional responses based on an appropriate interpretation of signals has been replaced by a probabilistic description of correlations between emitted and received symbols. This assumption leads to potential paradoxes, such as the presence of a maximum information associated to a channel that would actually create completely wrong interpretations of the signals. Game-theoretic models of language evolution use this view of Shannon's theory, but other approaches considering embodied communicating agents show that the correct (meaningful) match resulting from agent-agent exchanges is always achieved and natural systems obviously solve the problem correctly. How can Shannon's theory be expanded in such a way that meaning -at least, in its minimal referential form- is properly incorporated? Inspired by the concept of stated by the swiss linguist Ferdinand de Saussure, here we present a complete description of the minimal system necessary to measure the amount of information that is consistently decoded. Several consequences of our developments are investigated, such the uselessness of an amount of information properly transmitted for communication among autonomous agents.",

It is very useful in many text processing tasks employing relationships among EDUs such as text understanding, summarization, and question-answering. Thai language with its distinctive linguistic characteristics requires a unique technique. This article proposes an approach for Thai rhetorical structure analysis. First, EDUs are segmented by two hidden Markov models derived from syntactic rules. A rhetorical structure tree is constructed from a clustering technique with its similarity measure derived from Thai semantic rules. Then, a decision tree whose features derived from the semantic rules is used to determine discourse relations.',

	{'abstract': u'Back-propagation with gradient method is the most popular learning algorithm for feed-forward neural networks. However, it is critical to determine a proper fixed learning rate for the algorithm. In this paper, an optimized recursive algorithm is presented for online learning based on matrix operation and optimization methods analytically, which can avoid the trouble to select a proper learning rate for the gradient method. The proof of weak convergence of the proposed algorithm also is given. Although this approach is proposed for three-layer, feed-forward neural networks, it could be extended to multiple layer feed-forward neural networks. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithms applied to the identification of behavior of a two-input and two-output non-linear dynamic system is demonstrated by simulation experiments.',

	{'abstract': u'Secure multi-party computation is a central problem in modern cryptography. An important sub-class of this are problems of the following form: Alice and Bob desire to produce sample(s) of a pair of jointly distributed random variables. Each party must learn nothing more about the other party\'s output than what its own output reveals. To aid in this, they have available a set up - correlated random variables whose distribution is different from the desired distribution - as well as unlimited noiseless communication. In this paper we present an upperbound on how efficiently a given set up can be used to produce samples from a desired distribution. The key tool we develop is a generalization of the concept of common information of two dependent random variables [Gacs-Korner, 1973]. Our generalization - a three-dimensional region - remedies some of the limitations of the original definition which captured only a limited form of dependence. It also includes as a special case Wyner\'s common information [Wyner, 1975]. To derive the cryptographic bounds, we rely on a monotonicity property of this region: the region of the "views" of Alice and Bob engaged in any protocol can only monotonically expand and not shrink. Thus, by comparing the regions for the target random variables and the given random variables, we obtain our upperbound.',

	{'abstract': u'We propose an adaptive transmission technique for free space optical (FSO) systems, operating in atmospheric turbulence and employing subcarrier phase shift keying (S-PSK) intensity modulation. Exploiting the constant envelope characteristics of S-PSK, the proposed technique offers efficient utilization of the FSO channel capacity by adapting the modulation order of S-PSK, according to the instantaneous state of turbulence induced fading and a pre-defined bit error rate (BER) requirement. Novel expressions for the spectral efficiency and average BER of the proposed adaptive FSO system are presented and performance investigations under various turbulence conditions and target BER requirements are carried out. Numerical results indicate that significant spectral efficiency gains are offered without increasing the transmitted average optical power or sacrificing BER requirements, in moderate-to-strong turbulence conditions. Furthermore, the proposed variable rate transmission technique is applied to multiple input multiple output (MIMO) FSO systems, providing additional improvement in the achieved spectral efficiency as the number of the transmit and/or receive apertures increases.',

On the opposite, point to point communications are designed from the algorithm requirements but they are expensives in terms of resource and wire. We propose a dedicated communication architecture for image analysis algorithms. This communication mechanism is a generic NoC infrastructure dedicated to dataflow image processing applications, mixing circuit-switching and packet-switching communications. The complete architecture integrates two dedicated communication architectures and reusable IP blocks. Communications are based on the NoC concept to support the high bandwidth required for a large number and type of data.',

	{'abstract': u'The problems studied in this article originate from the Graph Motif problem introduced by Lacroix et al. in the context of biological networks. The problem is to decide if a vertex-colored graph has a connected subgraph whose colors equal a given multiset of colors . It is a graph pattern-matching problem variant, where the structure of the occurrence of the pattern is not of interest but the only requirement is the connectedness. Using an algebraic framework recently introduced by Koutis et al., we obtain new FPT algorithms for Graph Motif and variants, with improved running times. We also obtain results on the counting versions of this problem, proving that the counting problem is FPT if M is a set, but becomes W[1]-hard if M is a multiset with two colors. Finally, we present an experimental evaluation of this approach on real datasets, showing that its performance compares favorably with existing software.',

	{'abstract': u'Wireless mobile grids are one of the emerging grid types, which help to pool the resources of several willing and cooperative mobile devices to resolve a computationally intensive task. The mobile grids exhibit stronger challenges like mobility management of devices, providing transparent access to grid resources, task management and handling of limited resources so that resources are shared efficiently. Task execution on these devices should not be affected by their mobility. The proposed work presents performance evaluation of wireless mobile grid using normal walk mobility model. The normal walk model represents daily motion of users and the direction of motion is mostly symmetric in a real life environment, thus it is effective in location updating of a mobile station and in turn helps task distribution among these available mobile stations. Some of the performance parameters such as Task Execution Time, task failure rate, communication overhead on Brokering Server and Monitoring Cost are discussed.',

	{'abstract': u'We propose a method for inferring emph for logic programs as solutions for systems of constraints over sets of finite ground Herbrand terms (set constraint systems). Such parameterized regular types generalize emph regular types by extending the scope of the parameters in the type definitions so that such parameters can relate the types of different predicates. We propose a number of enhancements to the procedure for solving the constraint systems that improve the precision of the type descriptions inferred. The resulting algorithm, together with a procedure to establish a set constraint system from a logic program, yields a program analysis that infers tighter safe approximations of the success types of the program than previous comparable work, offering a new and useful efficiency vs. precision trade-off. This is supported by experimental results, which show the feasibility of our analysis.',

	{'abstract': u'In the k-edge-connected spanning subgraph problem we are given a graph (V, E) and costs for each edge, and want to find a minimum-cost subset F of E such that (V, F) is k-edge-connected. We show there is a constant eps &gt; 0 so that for all k &gt; 1, finding a (1 + eps)-approximation for k-ECSS is NP-hard, establishing a gap between the unit-cost and general-cost versions. Next, we consider the multi-subgraph cousin of k-ECSS, in which we purchase a multi-subset F of E, with unlimited parallel copies available at the same cost as the original edge. We conjecture that a (1 + Theta(1/k))-approximation algorithm exists, and we describe an approach based on graph decompositions applied to its natural linear programming (LP) relaxation. The LP is essentially equivalent to the Held-Karp LP for TSP and the undirected LP for Steiner tree. We give a family of extreme points for the LP which are more complex than those previously known.',

	{'abstract': u"WLAN localization has become an active research field recently. Due to the wide WLAN deployment, WLAN localization provides ubiquitous coverage and adds to the value of the wireless network by providing the location of its users without using any additional hardware. However, WLAN localization systems usually require constructing a radio map, which is a major barrier of WLAN localization systems' deployment. The radio map stores information about the signal strength from different signal strength streams at selected locations in the site of interest. Typical construction of a radio map involves measurements and calibrations making it a tedious and time-consuming operation. In this paper, we present the AROMA system that automatically constructs accurate active and passive radio maps for both device-based and device-free WLAN localization systems. AROMA has three main goals: high accuracy, low computational requirements, and minimum user overhead. To achieve high accuracy, AROMA uses 3D ray tracing enhanced with the uniform theory of diffraction (UTD) to model the electric field behavior and the human shadowing effect. AROMA also automates a number of routine tasks, such as importing building models and automatic sampling of the area of interest, to reduce the user's overhead. Finally, AROMA uses a number of optimization techniques to reduce the computational requirements. We present our system architecture and describe the details of its different components that allow AROMA to achieve its goals. We evaluate AROMA in two different testbeds. Our experiments show that the predicted signal strength differs from the measurements by a maximum average absolute error of 3.18 dBm achieving a maximum localization error of 2.44m for both the device-based and device-free cases.",

The face matching strategy is based on matching individual salient facial graph characterized by SIFT features as connected to facial landmarks such as the eyes and the mouth. In order to reduce the face matching errors, the Dempster-Shafer decision theory is applied to fuse the individual matching scores obtained from each pair of salient facial features. The proposed algorithm is evaluated with the ORL and the IITK face databases.

	{'abstract': u'Developing suitable formal semantics can be of great help in the understanding, design and implementation of a programming language, and act as a guide for software development tools like analyzers or partial evaluators. In this sense, full abstraction is a highly desirable property, indicating a perfect correspondence between the semantics and the observable behavior of program pieces. In this work we address the question of full abstraction for the family of modern functional logic languages, in which functions can be higher order and non-deterministic, and where the semantics adopted for non-determinism is emph. We show that, with respect to natural notions of emph, any semantics based on emph functions is necessarily unsound; in contrast, we show that the higher order version of emph, a well-known existing semantic framework for functional logic programming, based on an emph view of functions, turns out to be fully abstract and compositional.',

	{'abstract': u'This paper presents a feature level fusion approach which uses the improved K-medoids clustering algorithm and isomorphic graph for face and palmprint biometrics. Partitioning around medoids (PAM) algorithm is used to partition the set of n invariant feature points of the face and palmprint images into k clusters. By partitioning the face and palmprint images with scale invariant features SIFT points, a number of clusters is formed on both the images. Then on each cluster, an isomorphic graph is drawn. In the next step, the most probable pair of graphs is searched using iterative relaxation algorithm from all possible isomorphic graphs for a pair of corresponding face and palmprint images. Finally, graphs are fused by pairing the isomorphic graphs into augmented groups in terms of addition of invariant SIFT points and in terms of combining pair of keypoint descriptors by concatenation rule. Experimental results obtained from the extensive evaluation show that the proposed feature level fusion with the improved K-medoids partitioning algorithm increases the performance of the system with utmost level of accuracy.',

	{'abstract': u'The Low Latency Fault Tolerance (LLFT) system provides fault tolerance for distributed applications, using the leader-follower replication technique. The LLFT system provides application-transparent replication, with strong replica consistency, for applications that involve multiple interacting processes or threads. The LLFT system comprises a Low Latency Messaging Protocol, a Leader-Determined Membership Protocol, and a Virtual Determinizer Framework. The Low Latency Messaging Protocol provides reliable, totally ordered message delivery by employing a direct group-to-group multicast, where the message ordering is determined by the primary replica in the group. The Leader-Determined Membership Protocol provides reconfiguration and recovery when a replica becomes faulty and when a replica joins or leaves a group, where the membership of the group is determined by the primary replica. The Virtual Determinizer Framework captures the ordering information at the primary replica and enforces the same ordering at the backup replicas for major sources of non-determinism, including multi-threading, time-related operations and socket communication. The LLFT system achieves low latency message delivery during normal operation and low latency reconfiguration and recovery when a fault occurs.',

	{'abstract': u'This paper discusses highly general mechanisms for specifying the refinement of a real-time system as a collection of lower level parallel components that preserve the timing and functional requirements of the upper level specification. These mechanisms are discussed in the context of ASTRAL, which is a formal specification language for real-time systems. Refinement is accomplished by mapping all of the elements of an upper level specification into lower level elements that may be split among several parallel components. In addition, actions that can occur in the upper level are mapped to actions of components operating at the lower level. This allows several types of implementation strategies to be specified in a natural way, while the price for generality (in terms of complexity) is paid only when necessary. The refinement mechanisms are first illustrated using a simple digital circuit; then, through a highly complex phone system; finally, design guidelines gleaned from these specifications are presented.',

	{'abstract': u'We consider network contribution games, where each agent in a social network has a budget of effort that he can contribute to different collaborative projects or relationships. Depending on the contribution of the involved agents a relationship will flourish or drown, and to measure the success we use a reward function for each relationship. Every agent is trying to maximize the reward from all relationships that it is involved in. We consider pairwise equilibria of this game, and characterize the existence, computational complexity, and quality of equilibrium based on the types of reward functions involved. For example, when all reward functions are concave, we prove that the price of anarchy is at most 2. For convex functions the same only holds under some special but very natural conditions. A special focus of the paper are minimum effort games, where the reward of a relationship depends only on the minimum effort of any of the participants. Finally, we show tight bounds for approximate equilibria and convergence of dynamics in these games.',

	{'abstract': u'A key problem in sensor networks is to decide which sensors to query when, in order to obtain the most useful information (e.g., for performing accurate prediction), subject to constraints (e.g., on power and bandwidth). In many applications the utility function is not known a priori, must be learned from data, and can even change over time. Furthermore for large sensor networks solving a centralized optimization problem to select sensors is not feasible, and thus we seek a fully distributed solution. In this paper, we present Distributed Online Greedy (DOG), an efficient, distributed algorithm for repeatedly selecting sensors online, only receiving feedback about the utility of the selected sensors. We prove very strong theoretical no-regret guarantees that apply whenever the (unknown) utility function satisfies a natural diminishing returns property called submodularity. Our algorithm has extremely low communication requirements, and scales well to large sensor deployments. We extend DOG to allow observation-dependent sensor selection. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm on several real-world sensing tasks.',

	{'abstract': u'We see how nested sequents, a natural generalisation of hypersequents, allow us to develop a systematic proof theory for modal logics. As opposed to other prominent formalisms, such as the display calculus and labelled sequents, nested sequents stay inside the modal language and allow for proof systems which enjoy the subformula property in the literal sense. In the first part we study a systematic set of nested sequent systems for all normal modal logics formed by some combination of the axioms for seriality, reflexivity, symmetry, transitivity and euclideanness. We establish soundness and completeness and some of their good properties, such as invertibility of all rules, admissibility of the structural rules, termination of proof-search, as well as syntactic cut-elimination. In the second part we study the logic of common knowledge, a modal logic with a fixpoint modality. We look at two infinitary proof systems for this logic: an existing one based on ordinary sequents, for which no syntactic cut-elimination procedure is known, and a new one based on nested sequents. We see how nested sequents, in contrast to ordinary sequents, allow for syntactic cut-elimination and thus allow us to obtain an ordinal upper bound on the length of proofs.',

	{'abstract': u"The capacity region of the N-sender Gaussian multiple access channel with feedback is not known in general. This paper studies the class of linear-feedback codes that includes (nonlinear) nonfeedback codes at one extreme and the linear-feedback codes by Schalkwijk and Kailath, Ozarow, and Kramer at the other extreme. The linear-feedback sum-capacity C_L(N,P) under symmetric power constraints P is characterized, the maximum sum-rate achieved by linear-feedback codes when each sender has the equal block power constraint P. In particular, it is shown that Kramer's code achieves this linear-feedback sum-capacity. The proof involves the dependence balance condition introduced by Hekstra and Willems and extended by Kramer and Gastpar, and the analysis of the resulting nonconvex optimization problem via a Lagrange dual formulation. Finally, an observation is presented based on the properties of the conditional maximal correlation---an extension of the Hirschfeld--Gebelein--Renyi maximal correlation---which reinforces the conjecture that Kramer's code achieves not only the linear-feedback sum-capacity, but also the sum-capacity itself (the maximum sum-rate achieved by arbitrary feedback codes).",

However, these impairments are not well addressed when analyzing the throughput performance of MIMO Ad Hoc networks. In this paper, we present an analytical framework to evaluate the throughput of MIMO OFDM system under the impairments of phase noise, residual frequency offset, and imperfect channel estimation. Using this framework, we evaluate the Maximum Sum Throughput (MST) in Ad Hoc networks by optimizing the power and modulation schemes of each user. Simulations are conducted to demonstrate not only the improvement in the MST from using multiple antennas, but also the loss in the MST due to the transceiver impairments. The proposed analytical framework is further applied for the distributed implementation of MST in Ad Hoc networks, where the loss caused by impairments is also evaluated.',

Irving and Leather proved that counting the number of stable matchings in the general case is -complete. Counting the number of stable matchings is reducible to counting the number of downsets in a (related) partial order and is interreducible, in an approximation-preserving sense, to a class of problems that includes counting the number of independent sets in a bipartite graph (). It is conjectured that no FPRAS exists for this class of problems. We show this approximation-preserving interreducibilty remains even in the restricted -attribute setting when (dot products) or (Euclidean distances).

	{'abstract': u'Estimating characteristics of large graphs via sampling is a vital part of the study of complex networks. Current sampling methods such as (independent) random vertex and random walks are useful but have drawbacks. Random vertex sampling may require too many resources (time, bandwidth, or money). Random walks, which normally require fewer resources per sample, can suffer from large estimation errors in the presence of disconnected or loosely connected graphs. In this work we propose a new -dimensional random walk that uses dependent random walkers. We show that the proposed sampling method, which we call Frontier sampling, exhibits all of the nice sampling properties of a regular random walk. At the same time, our simulations over large real world graphs show that, in the presence of disconnected or loosely connected components, Frontier sampling exhibits lower estimation errors than regular random walks. We also show that Frontier sampling is more suitable than random vertex sampling to sample the tail of the degree distribution of the graph.',

	{'abstract': u'There has been much progress on efficient algorithms for clustering data points generated by a mixture of probability distributions under the assumption that the means of the distributions are well-separated, i.e., the distance between the means of any two distributions is at least standard deviations. These results generally make heavy use of the generative model and particular properties of the distributions. In this paper, we show that a simple clustering algorithm works without assuming any generative (probabilistic) model. Our only assumption is what we call a "proximity condition": the projection of any data point onto the line joining its cluster center to any other cluster center is standard deviations closer to its own center than the other center. Here the notion of standard deviations is based on the spectral norm of the matrix whose rows represent the difference between a point and the mean of the cluster to which it belongs. We show that in the generative models studied, our proximity condition is satisfied and so we are able to derive most known results for generative models as corollaries of our main result. We also prove some new results for generative models - e.g., we can cluster all but a small fraction of points only assuming a bound on the variance. Our algorithm relies on the well known -means algorithm, and along the way, we prove a result of independent interest -- that the -means algorithm converges to the "true centers" even in the presence of spurious points provided the initial (estimated) centers are close enough to the corresponding actual centers and all but a small fraction of the points satisfy the proximity condition. Finally, we present a new technique for boosting the ratio of inter-center separation to standard deviation.',

	{'abstract': u"A major enterprise in compressed sensing and sparse approximation is the design and analysis of computationally tractable algorithms for recovering sparse, exact or approximate, solutions of underdetermined linear systems of equations. Many such algorithms have now been proven to have optimal-order uniform recovery guarantees using the ubiquitous Restricted Isometry Property (RIP). However, it is unclear when the RIP-based sufficient conditions on the algorithm are satisfied. We present a framework in which this task can be achieved; translating these conditions for Gaussian measurement matrices into requirements on the signal's sparsity level, length, and number of measurements. We illustrate this approach on three of the state-of-the-art greedy algorithms: CoSaMP, Subspace Pursuit (SP), and Iterative Hard Thresholding (IHT). Designed to allow a direct comparison of existing theory, our framework implies that, according to the best known bounds, IHT requires the fewest number of compressed sensing measurements and has the lowest per iteration computational cost of the three algorithms compared here.",

The proposed under/over-flow rate minimization (FRM) method employs an optimization process to get a statistically more accurate estimation of unknown DC coefficients, thus achieving a better recovery performance. It was shown by experimental results based on 200 test images that the proposed DC recovery method significantly improves the quality of most recovered images in terms of the PSNR values and several state-of-the-art objective image quality assessment (IQA) metrics such as SSIM and MS-SSIM.',

	{'abstract': u"This paper presents a technique for approximating, up to any precision, the set of subgame-perfect equilibria (SPE) in discounted repeated games. The process starts with a single hypercube approximation of the set of SPE. Then the initial hypercube is gradually partitioned on to a set of smaller adjacent hypercubes, while those hypercubes that cannot contain any point belonging to the set of SPE are simultaneously withdrawn. Whether a given hypercube can contain an equilibrium point is verified by an appropriate mathematical program. Three different formulations of the algorithm for both approximately computing the set of SPE payoffs and extracting players' strategies are then proposed: the first two that do not assume the presence of an external coordination between players, and the third one that assumes a certain level of coordination during game play for convexifying the set of continuation payoffs after any repeated game history. A special attention is paid to the question of extracting players' strategies and their representability in form of finite automata, an important feature for artificial agent systems.",

	{'abstract': u'UCMs (Use Case Maps) model describes functional requirements and high-level designs with causal paths superimposed on a structure of components. It could provide useful resources for software acceptance testing. However until now statistical testing technologies for large scale software is not considered yet in UCMs model. Thus if one applies UCMs model to a large scale software using traditional coverage based exhaustive tasting, then it requires too much costs for the quality assurance. Therefore this paper proposes an importance analysis of UCMs model with Markov chains. With this approach not only highly frequently used usage scenarios but also important objects such as components, responsibilities, stubs and plugins can also be identified from UCMs specifications. Therefore careful analysis, design, implementation and efficient testing could be possible with the importance of scenarios and objects during the full software life cycle. Consequently product reliability can be obtained with low costs. This paper includes an importance analysis method that identifies important scenarios and objects and a case study to illustrate the applicability of the proposed approach.',

The PDDP algorithm recursively splits the data samples into two sub clusters using the hyper plane normal to the principal direction derived from the covariance matrix, which is the central logic of the algorithm. However, the PDDP algorithm can yield poor results, especially when clusters are not well separated from one another. To improve the quality of the clustering results problem, it is resolved by reallocating new cluster membership using the IB algorithm with different settings. IB Method gives accuracy but time consumption is more. Furthermore, based on the theoretical background of the sGEM algorithm and sequential Information Bottleneck method(sIB), it can be obvious to extend the framework to cover the problem of estimating the number of clusters using the Bayesian Information Criterion. Experimental results are given to show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm with comparison to the existing algorithm.',

	{'abstract': u'Efficient routing mechanism is a challenging issue for group oriented computing in Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANETs). The ability of MANETs to support adequate Quality of Service (QoS) for group communication is limited by the ability of the underlying ad-hoc routing protocols to provide consistent behavior despite the dynamic properties of mobile computing devices. In MANET QoS requirements can be quantified in terms of Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR), Data Latency, Packet Loss Probability, Routing Overhead, Medium Access Control (MAC) Overhead and Data Throughput etc. This paper presents an in depth study of one to many and many to many communications in MANETs and provides a comparative performance evaluation of unicast and broadcast routing protocols. Dynamic Source Routing protocol (DSR) is used as unicast protocol and BCAST is used to represent broadcast protocol. The performance differentials are analyzed using ns2 network simulator varying multicast group size (number of data senders and data receivers). Both protocols are simulated with identical traffic loads and mobility models. Simulation result shows that BCAST performs better than DSR in most cases.',

	{'abstract': u'Distributed contention based Medium Access Control (MAC) protocols are the fundamental components for IEEE 802.11 based Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs). Contention windows (CW) change dynamically to adapt to the current contention level, Upon each packet collision, a station doubles its CW to reduce further collision of packets. IEEE 802.11 Distributed Coordination Function (DCF) suffers from a common problem in erroneous channel. They cannot distinguish noise lost packets from collision lost packets. In both situations a station does not receive its ACK and doubles the CW to reduce further packet collisions. This increases backoff overhead unnecessarily in addition to the noise lost packets, reduces the throughput significantly. Furthermore, the aggregate throughput of a practical WLAN strongly depends on the channel conditions. In real radio environment, the received signal power at the access point from a station is subjected to deterministic path loss, shadowing and fast multipath fading. In this paper, we propose a new saturation throughput analysis for IEEE 802.11 DCF considering erroneous channel and capture effects. To alleviate the low performance of IEEE 802.11 DCF, we introduce a mechanism that greatly outperforms under noisy environment with low network traffic and compare their performances to the existing standards. We extend the multidimensional Markov chain model initially proposed by Bianchi(3) to characterize the behavior of DCF in order to account both real channel conditions and capture effects, especially in a high interference radio environment.',

	{'abstract': u'The traditional TCP congestion control mechanism encounters a number of new problems and suffers a poor performance when the IEEE 802.11 MAC protocol is used in multihop ad hoc networks. Many of the problems result from medium contention at the MAC layer. In this paper, I first illustrate that severe medium contention and congestion are intimately coupled, and TCP s congestion control algorithm becomes too coarse in its granularity, causing throughput instability and excessively long delay. Further, we illustrate TCP s severe unfairness problem due to the medium contention and the tradeoff between aggregate throughput and fairness. Then, based on the novel use of channel busyness ratio, a more accurate metric to characterize the network utilization and congestion status, I propose a new wireless congestion control protocol (WCCP) to efficiently and fairly support the transport service in multihop ad hoc networks. In this protocol, each forwarding node along a traffic flow exercises the internode and intranode fair resource allocation and determines the MAC layer feedback accordingly. The endtoend feedback, which is ultimately determined by the bottleneck node along the flow, is carried back to the source to control its sending rate. Extensive simulations show that WCCP significantly outperforms traditional TCP in terms of channel utilization, delay, and fairness, and eliminates the starvation problem.',

The proposed model order reduction method is a mixed method, where the numerator polynomial of reduced order model is obtained by using stability equation method and the denominator polynomial is obtained by using some approximation technique preceded in this paper.

	{'abstract': u"The development and application of various remote sensing platforms result in the production of huge amounts of satellite image data. Therefore, there is an increasing need for effective querying and browsing in these image databases. In order to take advantage and make good use of satellite images data, we must be able to extract meaningful information from the imagery. Hence we proposed a new algorithm for SAR image segmentation. In this paper we propose segmentation using vector quantization technique on entropy image. Initially, we obtain entropy image and in second step we use Kekre's Fast Codebook Generation (KFCG) algorithm for segmentation of the entropy image. Thereafter, a codebook of size 128 was generated for the Entropy image. These code vectors were further clustered in 8 clusters using same KFCG algorithm and converted into 8 images. These 8 images were displayed as a result. This approach does not lead to over segmentation or under segmentation. We compared these results with well known Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix. The proposed algorithm gives better segmentation with less complexity.",

	{'abstract': u'In wireless ad hoc networks, the absence of any control on packets forwarding, make these networks vulnerable by various deny of service attacks (DoS). A node, in wireless ad hoc network, counts always on intermediate nodes to send these packets to a given destination node. An intermediate node, which takes part in packets forwarding, may behave maliciously and drop packets which goes through it, instead of forwarding them to the following node. Such behavior is called black hole attack. In this paper, after having specified the black hole attack, a secure mechanism, which consists in checking the good forwarding of packets by an intermediate node, was proposed. The proposed solution avoids the black hole and the cooperative black hole attacks. Evaluation metrics were considered in simulation to show the effectiveness of the suggested solution.',

Proving their competency in numerous aspects, WiMAX and LTE already have already made a strong position in telecommunication industry. Both WiMAX and LTE are 4G technologies designed to move data rather than voice having IP networks based on OFDM technology. So, they aren't like typical technological rivals as of GSM and CDMA. But still a gesture of hostility seems to outburst long before the stable commercial launch of LTE. In this paper various aspects of WiMAX and LTE for deployment have been analyzed. Again, we tried to make every possible consideration with respect to south Asia i.e. how mass people of this region may be benefited. As a result, it might be regarded as a good source in case of making major BWA deployment decisions in this region.

	{'abstract': u'In Wireless Mesh Networks (WMN), a channel assignment has to balance the objectives of maintaining connectivity and increasing the aggregate bandwidth. The main aim of the channel assignment algorithm is to assign the channels to the network interfaces, from the given expected load on each virtual link. From the existing work done so far, we can examine that there is no combined solution of multi-channel assignment with routing and congestion control. In this paper, we propose a congestion control routing protocol along with multi-channel assignment. We use a traffic aware metric in this protocol in order to provide quality of service. The proposed protocol can improve the throughput and channel utilization to very high extent because it provides solution for multi-channel assignment and congestion control. The proposed algorithm assigns the channels in a way that, congestion is avoided and co-channel interference levels among links with same channel are reduced. By our simulation results in NS2, we show that the proposed protocol attains high throughput and channel utilization along with reduced latency.',

The best criteria developed so far to select the solutions to be counted discriminate among neighboring solutions on the basis of uniform information about each individual free variable. What we mean by uniform information, is information which does not depend on the solution: e.g. the number of positive/negative occurrences of the considered variable. What is new in our approach is that we use non uniform information about variables. Thus we are able to make a more precise tuning, resulting in a slight improvement on upper bounding the 3-SAT threshold for various models of formulas defined by their distributions.',

	{'abstract': u'In this paper we propose two analytically tractable stochastic models of non-slotted Aloha for Mobile Ad-hoc NETworks (MANETs): one model assumes a static pattern of nodes while the other assumes that the pattern of nodes varies over time. Both models feature transmitters randomly located in the Euclidean plane, according to a Poisson point process with the receivers randomly located at a fixed distance from the emitters. We concentrate on the so-called outage scenario, where a successful transmission requires a Signal-to-Interference-and-Noise Ratio (SINR) larger than a given threshold. With Rayleigh fading and the SINR averaged over the duration of the packet transmission, both models lead to closed form expressions for the probability of successful transmission. We show an excellent matching of these results with simulations. Using our models we compare the performances of non-slotted Aloha to previously studied slotted Aloha. We observe that when the path loss is not very strong both models, when appropriately optimized, exhibit similar performance. For stronger path loss non-slotted Aloha performs worse than slotted Aloha, however when the path loss exponent is equal to 4 its density of successfully received packets is still 75% of that in the slotted scheme. This is still much more than the 50% predicted by the well-known analysis where simultaneous transmissions are never successful. Moreover, in any path loss scenario, both schemes exhibit the same energy efficiency.',

	{'abstract': u'Terrorism has led to many problems in Thai societies, not only property damage but also civilian casualties. Predicting terrorism activities in advance can help prepare and manage risk from sabotage by these activities. This paper proposes a framework focusing on event classification in terrorism domain using fuzzy inference systems (FISs). Each FIS is a decision-making model combining fuzzy logic and approximate reasoning. It is generated in five main parts: the input interface, the fuzzification interface, knowledge base unit, decision making unit and output defuzzification interface. Adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) is a FIS model adapted by combining the fuzzy logic and neural network. The ANFIS utilizes automatic identification of fuzzy logic rules and adjustment of membership function (MF). Moreover, neural network can directly learn from data set to construct fuzzy logic rules and MF implemented in various applications. FIS settings are evaluated based on two comparisons. The first evaluation is the comparison between unstructured and structured events using the same FIS setting. The second comparison is the model settings between FIS and ANFIS for classifying structured events. The data set consists of news articles related to terrorism events in three southern provinces of Thailand. The experimental results show that the classification performance of the FIS resulting from structured events achieves satisfactory accuracy and is better than the unstructured events. In addition, the classification of structured events using ANFIS gives higher performance than the events using only FIS in the prediction of terrorism events.',

Due to a general Mezei-Wright type result, algebraic linear orderings are exactly those isomorphic to the linear ordering of the leaves of an algebraic tree. Using Courcelle's characterization of algebraic trees, we obtain the fact that a linear ordering is algebraic if and only if it can be represented as the lexicographic ordering of a deterministic context-free language. When the algebraic linear ordering is a well-ordering, its order type is an algebraic ordinal. We prove that the Hausdorff rank of any scattered algebraic linear ordering is less than .

	{'abstract': u'There has been a remarkable increase in the data exchange over web and the widespread use of digital media. As a result, multimedia data transfers also had a boost up. The mounting interest with reference to digital watermarking throughout the last decade is certainly due to the increase in the need of copyright protection of digital content. This is also enhanced due to commercial prospective. Applications of video watermarking in copy control, broadcast monitoring, fingerprinting, video authentication, copyright protection etc is immensely rising. The main aspects of information hiding are capacity, security and robustness. Capacity deals with the amount of information that can be hidden. The skill of anyone detecting the information is security and robustness refers to the resistance to modification of the cover content before concealed information is destroyed. Video watermarking algorithms normally prefers robustness. In a robust algorithm it is not possible to eliminate the watermark without rigorous degradation of the cover content. In this paper, we introduce the notion of Video Watermarking and the features required to design a robust watermarked video for a valuable application. We review several algorithms, and introduce frequently used key techniques. The aim of this paper is to focus on the various domains of video watermarking techniques. The majority of the reviewed methods based on video watermarking emphasize on the notion of robustness of the algorithm.',

	{'abstract': u'A PCP is a proof system for NP in which the proof can be checked by a probabilistic verifier. The verifier is only allowed to read a very small portion of the proof, and in return is allowed to err with some bounded probability. The probability that the verifier accepts a false proof is called the soundness error, and is an important parameter of a PCP system that one seeks to minimize. Constructing PCPs with sub-constant soundness error and, at the same time, a minimal number of queries into the proof (namely two) is especially important due to applications for inapproximability. In this work we construct such PCP verifiers, i.e., PCPs that make only two queries and have sub-constant soundness error. Our construction can be viewed as a combinatorial alternative to the "manifold vs. point" construction, which is the only construction in the literature for this parameter range. The "manifold vs. point" PCP is based on a low degree test, while our construction is based on a direct product test. We also extend our construction to yield a decodable PCP (dPCP) with the same parameters. By plugging in this dPCP into the scheme of Dinur and Harsha (FOCS 2009) one gets an alternative construction of the result of Moshkovitz and Raz (FOCS 2008), namely: a construction of two-query PCPs with small soundness error and small alphabet size. Our construction of a PCP is based on extending the derandomized direct product test of Impagliazzo, Kabanets and Wigderson (STOC 09) to a derandomized parallel repetition theorem. More accurately, our PCP construction is obtained in two steps. We first prove a derandomized parallel repetition theorem for specially structured PCPs. Then, we show that any PCP can be transformed into one that has the required structure, by embedding it on a de-Bruijn graph.',

	{'abstract': u"Cross Site Scripting (XSS) Flaws are currently the most popular security problems in modern web applications. These Flaws make use of vulnerabilities in the code of web-applications, resulting in serious consequences, such as theft of cookies, passwords and other personal credentials. Cross-Site scripting Flaws occur when accessing information in intermediate trusted sites. Client side solution acts as a web proxy to mitigate Cross Site Scripting Flaws which manually generated rules to mitigate Cross Site Scripting attempts. Client side solution effectively protects against information leakage from the user's environment. Cross Site Scripting Flaws are easy to execute, but difficult to detect and prevent. This paper provides client-side solution to mitigate cross-site scripting Flaws. The existing client-side solutions degrade the performance of client's system resulting in a poor web surfing experience. In this project provides a client side solution that uses a step by step approach to protect cross site scripting, without degrading much the user's web browsing experience.",

	{'abstract': u'We investigate power allocation for users in a spectrum underlay cognitive network. Our objective is to find a power control scheme that allocates transmit power for both primary and secondary users so that the overall network throughput is maximized while maintaining the quality of service (QoS) of the primary users greater than a certain minimum limit. Since an optimum solution to our problem is computationally intractable, as the optimization problem is non-convex, we propose an iterative algorithm based on sequential geometric programming, that is proved to converge to at least a local optimum solution. We use the proposed algorithm to show how a spectrum underlay network would achieve higher throughput with secondary users operation than with primary users operating alone. Also, we show via simulations that the loss in primary throughput due to the admission of the secondary users is accompanied by a reduction in the total primary transmit power.',

	{'abstract': u'Image segmentation is a vital part of image processing. Segmentation has its application widespread in the field of medical images in order to diagnose curious diseases. The same medical images can be segmented manually. But the accuracy of image segmentation using the segmentation algorithms is more when compared with the manual segmentation. In the field of medical diagnosis an extensive diversity of imaging techniques is presently available, such as radiography, computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Medical image segmentation is an essential step for most consequent image analysis tasks. Although the original FCM algorithm yields good results for segmenting noise free images, it fails to segment images corrupted by noise, outliers and other imaging artifact. This paper presents an image segmentation approach using Modified Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) algorithm and Fuzzy Possibilistic c-means algorithm (FPCM). This approach is a generalized version of standard Fuzzy CMeans Clustering (FCM) algorithm. The limitation of the conventional FCM technique is eliminated in modifying the standard technique. The Modified FCM algorithm is formulated by modifying the distance measurement of the standard FCM algorithm to permit the labeling of a pixel to be influenced by other pixels and to restrain the noise effect during segmentation. Instead of having one term in the objective function, a second term is included, forcing the membership to be as high as possible without a maximum limit constraint of one. Experiments are conducted on real images to investigate the performance of the proposed modified FCM technique in segmenting the medical images. Standard FCM, Modified FCM, Fuzzy Possibilistic CMeans algorithm (FPCM) are compared to explore the accuracy of our proposed approach.',

	{'abstract': u'In this paper we study algebraic branching programs (ABPs) with restrictions on the order and the number of reads of variables in the program. Given a permutation of variables, for a -ordered ABP (-OABP), for any directed path from source to sink, a variable can appear at most once on , and the order in which variables appear on must respect . An ABP is said to be of read , if any variable appears at most times in . Our main result pertains to the identity testing problem. Over any field and in the black-box model, i.e. given only query access to the polynomial, we have the following result: read -OABP computable polynomials can be tested in . Our next set of results investigates the computational limitations of OABPs. It is shown that any OABP computing the determinant or permanent requires size and read . We give a multilinear polynomial in variables over some specifically selected field , such that any OABP computing must read some variable at least times. We show that the elementary symmetric polynomial of degree in variables can be computed by a size read OABP, but not by a read OABP, for any . Finally, we give an example of a polynomial and two variables orders , such that can be computed by a read-once -OABP, but where any -OABP computing must read some variable at least',

	{'abstract': u'A few papers have been interested by the fixed switching frequency direct torque control fed by direct matrix converters, where we can find just the use of direct torque controlled space vector modulated method. In this present paper, we present an improved method used for a fixed switching frequency direct torque control (DTC) using a direct matrix converter (DMC). This method is characterized by a simple structure, a fixed switching frequency which causes minimal torque ripple and a unity input power factor. Using this strategy, we combine the direct matrix converters advantages with those of direct torque control (DTC) schemes. The used technique for constant frequency is combined with the input current space vector to create the switching table of direct matrix converter (DMC). Simulation results clearly demonstrate a better dynamic and steady state performances of the proposed method.',

	{'abstract': u"Adaptive control problems are notoriously difficult to solve even in the presence of plant-specific controllers. One way to by-pass the intractable computation of the optimal policy is to restate the adaptive control as the minimization of the relative entropy of a controller that ignores the true plant dynamics from an informed controller. The solution is given by the Bayesian control rule-a set of equations characterizing a stochastic adaptive controller for the class of possible plant dynamics. Here, the Bayesian control rule is applied to derive BCR-MDP, a controller to solve undiscounted Markov decision processes with finite state and action spaces and unknown dynamics. In particular, we derive a non-parametric conjugate prior distribution over the policy space that encapsulates the agent's whole relevant history and we present a Gibbs sampler to draw random policies from this distribution. Preliminary results show that BCR-MDP successfully avoids sub-optimal limit cycles due to its built-in mechanism to balance exploration versus exploitation.",

	{'abstract': u'We consider the problem of data exchange by a group of closely-located wireless nodes. In this problem each node holds a set of packets and needs to obtain all the packets held by other nodes. Each of the nodes can broadcast the packets in its possession (or a combination thereof) via a noiseless broadcast channel of capacity one packet per channel use. The goal is to minimize the total number of transmissions needed to satisfy the demands of all the nodes, assuming that they can cooperate with each other and are fully aware of the packet sets available to other nodes. This problem arises in several practical settings, such as peer-to-peer systems and wireless data broadcast. In this paper, we establish upper and lower bounds on the optimal number of transmissions and present an efficient algorithm with provable performance guarantees. The effectiveness of our algorithms is established through numerical simulations.',

	{'abstract': u'Clustering is an unsupervised learning method that constitutes a cornerstone of an intelligent data analysis process. It is used for the exploration of inter-relationships among a collection of patterns, by organizing them into homogeneous clusters. Clustering has been dynamically applied to a variety of tasks in the field of Information Retrieval (IR). Clustering has become one of the most active area of research and the development. Clustering attempts to discover the set of consequential groups where those within each group are more closely related to one another than the others assigned to different groups. The resultant clusters can provide a structure for organizing large bodies of text for efficient browsing and searching. There exists a wide variety of clustering algorithms that has been intensively studied in the clustering problem. Among the algorithms that remain the most common and effectual, the iterative optimization clustering algorithms have been demonstrated reasonable performance for clustering, e.g. the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm and its variants, and the well known k-means algorithm. This paper presents an analysis on how partition method clustering techniques - EM, K -means and K* Means algorithm work on heartspect dataset with below mentioned features - Purity, Entropy, CPU time, Cluster wise analysis, Mean value analysis and inter cluster distance. Thus the paper finally provides the experimental results of datasets for five clusters to strengthen the results that the quality of the behavior in clusters in EM algorithm is far better than k-means algorithm and k*means algorithm.',

	{'abstract': u'We show that the Parikh image of the language of an NFA with n states over an alphabet of size k can be described as a finite union of linear sets with at most k generators and total size 2^, i.e., polynomial for all fixed k &gt;= 1. Previously, it was not known whether the number of generators could be made independent of n, and best upper bounds on the total size were exponential in n. Furthermore, we give an algorithm for performing such a translation in time 2^. Our proof exploits a previously unknown connection to the theory of convex sets, and establishes a normal form theorem for semilinear sets, which is of independent interests. To complement these results, we show that our upper bounds are tight and that the results cannot be extended to context-free languages. We give four applications: (1) a new polynomial fragment of integer programming, (2) precise complexity of membership for Parikh images of NFAs, (3) an answer to an open question about polynomial PAC-learnability of semilinear sets, and (4) an optimal algorithm for LTL model checking over discrete-timed reversal-bounded counter systems.',

Temporal cache blocking is a known advanced optimization technique, which can reduce the pressure on the memory bus significantly. We apply and refine this optimization for a recently presented temporal blocking strategy designed to explicitly utilize multicore characteristics.

	{'abstract': u'Iterated regret minimization has been introduced recently by J.Y. Halpern and R. Pass in classical strategic games. For many games of interest, this new solution concept provides solutions that are judged more reasonable than solutions offered by traditional game concepts -- such as Nash equilibrium --. Although computing iterated regret on explicit matrix game is conceptually and computationally easy, nothing is known about computing the iterated regret on games whose matrices are defined implicitly using game tree, game DAG or, more generally game graphs. In this paper, we investigate iterated regret minimization for infinite duration two-player quantitative non-zero sum games played on graphs. We consider reachability objectives that are not necessarily antagonist. Edges are weighted by integers -- one for each player --, and the payoffs are defined by the sum of the weights along the paths. Depending on the class of graphs, we give either polynomial or pseudo-polynomial time algorithms to compute a strategy that minimizes the regret for a fixed player. We finally give algorithms to compute the strategies of the two players that minimize the iterated regret for trees, and for graphs with strictly positive weights only.',

	{'abstract': u'Active Constellation Extension (ACE) is one of techniques introduced for Peak to Average Power Ratio (PAPR) reduction for OFDM systems. In this technique, the constellation points are extended such that the PAPR is minimized but the minimum distance of the constellation points does not decrease. In this paper, an iterative ACE method is extended to spatially encoded OFDM systems. The proposed methods are such that the PAPR is reduced simultaneously at all antennas, while the spatial encoding relationships still hold. It will be shown that the original ACE method can be employed before Space Time Block Coding (STBC). But in case of Space Frequency Block Coding (SFBC), two modified techniques have been proposed. In the first method, the OFDM frame is separated by several subframes and the ACE method is applied to these subframes independently to reduce their corresponding PAPRs. Then the low PAPR subframes are recombined based on SFBC relationships to yield the transmitted signals from different antennas. In the second method, for each iteration, the ACE is applied to the antenna with the maximum PAPR, and the signals of the other antennas are generated from that of this antenna. Simulation results show that both algorithms converge, but the second method outperforms the first one when the number of antennas is increased.',

	{'abstract': u'Breadth First Search (BFS) and other graph traversal techniques are widely used for measuring large unknown graphs, such as online social networks. It has been empirically observed that an incomplete BFS is biased toward high degree nodes. In contrast to more studied sampling techniques, such as random walks, the precise bias of BFS has not been characterized to date. In this paper, we quantify the degree bias of BFS sampling. In particular, we calculate the node degree distribution expected to be observed by BFS as a function of the fraction of covered nodes, in a random graph with a given degree distribution . Furthermore, we also show that, for , all commonly used graph traversal techniques (BFS, DFS, Forest Fire, and Snowball Sampling) lead to the same bias, and we show how to correct for this bias. To give a broader perspective, we compare this class of exploration techniques to random walks that are well-studied and easier to analyze. Next, we study by simulation the effect of graph properties not captured directly by our model. We find that the bias gets amplified in graphs with strong positive assortativity. Finally, we demonstrate the above results by sampling the Facebook social network, and we provide some practical guidelines for graph sampling in practice.',

	{'abstract': u'Directed information theory deals with communication channels with feedback. When applied to networks, a natural extension based on causal conditioning is needed. We show here that measures built from directed information theory in networks can be used to assess Granger causality graphs of stochastic processes. We show that directed information theory includes measures such as the transfer entropy, and that it is the adequate information theoretic framework needed for neuroscience applications, such as connectivity inference problems.',

	{'abstract': u'Mathematics has many useful properties for developing of complex software systems. One is that it can exactly describe a physical situation of the object or outcome of an action. Mathematics support abstraction and this is an excellent medium for modeling, since it is an exact medium there is a little possibility of ambiguity. This paper demonstrates that mathematics provides a high level of validation when it is used as a software medium. It also outlines distinguishing characteristics of structural testing which is based on the source code of the program tested. Structural testing methods are very amenable to rigorous definition, mathematical analysis and precise measurement. Finally, it also discusses functional and structural testing debate to have a sense of complete testing. Any program can be considered to be a function in the sense that program input forms its domain and program outputs form its range. In general discrete mathematics is more applicable to functional testing, while graph theory pertains more to structural testing.',

	{'abstract': u'Visibly pushdown transducers form a subclass of pushdown transducers that (strictly) extends finite state transducers with a stack. Like visibly pushdown automata, the input symbols determine the stack operations. In this paper, we prove that functionality is decidable in PSpace for visibly pushdown transducers. The proof is done via a pumping argument: if a word with two outputs has a sufficiently large nesting depth, there exists a nested word with two outputs whose nesting depth is strictly smaller. The proof uses technics of word combinatorics. As a consequence of decidability of functionality, we also show that equivalence of functional visibly pushdown transducers is Exptime-Complete.',

	{'abstract': u'As wireless communication systems look intently to compose the transition from voice communication to interactive Internet data, achieving higher bit rates becomes both increasingly desirable and challenging. Space-time coding (STC) is a communications technique for wireless systems that inhabit multiple transmit antennas and single or multiple receive antennas. Space-time codes make use of advantage of both the spatial diversity provided by multiple antennas and the temporal diversity available with time-varying fading. Space-time codes can be divided into block codes and trellis codes. Space-time trellis coding merges signal processing at the receiver with coding techniques appropriate to multiple transmit antennas. The advantages of space-time codes (STC) make it extremely remarkable for high-rate wireless applications. Initial STC research efforts focused on narrowband flat-fading channels. The decoding complexity of Space-time turbo codes STTC increases exponentially as a function of the diversity level and transmission rate. This proposed paper provides an over view on various techniques used for the design of space-time turbo codes. This paper also discusses the techniques handled by researchers to built encoder and decoder section for multiple transmits and receives antennas. In addition the future enhancement gives a general idea for improvement and development of various codes which will involve implementing viterbi decoder with soft decoding in a multi-antenna scenario. In addition the space-time code may be analyzed using some of the available metrics and finally to simulate it for different receive antenna configurations.',

	{'abstract': u'We consider the local rank-modulation scheme in which a sliding window going over a sequence of real-valued variables induces a sequence of permutations. The local rank-modulation, as a generalization of the rank-modulation scheme, has been recently suggested as a way of storing information in flash memory. We study constant-weight Gray codes for the local rank-modulation scheme in order to simulate conventional multi-level flash cells while retaining the benefits of rank modulation. We provide necessary conditions for the existence of cyclic and cyclic optimal Gray codes. We then specifically study codes of weight 2 and upper bound their efficiency, thus proving that there are no such asymptotically-optimal cyclic codes. In contrast, we study codes of weight 3 and efficiently construct codes which are asymptotically-optimal.',

	{'abstract': u'Due to mobility in Ad-Hoc network the topology of the network may change randomly, rapidly and unexpectedly, because of these aspects, the routes in the network often disappear and new to arise. To avoid frequent route discovery and route failure EAOMDV was proposed based on existing routing protocol AOMDV. The EAOMDV (Enhanced Ad-Hoc on Demand Multipath Distance Vector) Routing protocol was proposed to solve the "route failure" problem in AOMDV. EAOMDV protocol reduces the route failure problem by preemptively predicting the link failure by the signal power received by the receiver (pr). This proposed protocol controls overhead, increases throughput and reduces the delay. The EAOMDV protocol was implemented on NS-2 and evaluation results show that the EAOMDV outperformed AOMDV.',

	{'abstract': u'The CLP scheme uses Horn clauses and SLD resolution to generate multiple constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs). The possible CSPs include rational trees (giving Prolog) and numerical algorithms for solving linear equations and linear programs (giving CLP(R)). In this paper we develop a form of CSP for interval constraints. In this way one obtains a logic semantics for the efficient floating-point hardware that is available on most computers. The need for the method arises because in the practice of scheduling and engineering design it is not enough to solve a single CSP. Ideally one should be able to consider thousands of CSPs and efficiently solve them or show them to be unsolvable. This is what CLP/NCSP, the new subscheme of CLP described in this paper is designed to do.',

	{'abstract': u'The Second International Workshop on Programming Language Approaches to Concurrency and Communication-cEntric Software (PLACES) was co-located with ETAPS 2009 in the city of York, England. The workshop took place on Sunday 22nd March 2009. The workshop focused on the challenges raised by the changing landscape of computer software. Traditionally, most software was written for a single computer with one CPU. However applications on the web today are built using numerous interacting services deployed on across many machines; soon off-the-shelf CPUs will host thousands of cores, and sensor networks will be composed from a large number of processing units. Many normal applications will soon need to make effective use of thousands of computing nodes. At some level of granularity, computation in such systems will be inherently concurrent and communication-centred. The development of effective programming methodologies for the coming computing paradigm demands exploration and understanding of a wide variety of ideas and techniques. This workshop offered a forum where researchers from different fields could exchange new ideas on one of the central challenges for programming in the near future, the development of programming methodologies and infrastructures where concurrency and distribution are the norm rather than a marginal concern.',

	{'abstract': u"The paper presents new clustering algorithm. The proposed algorithm gives less distortion as compared to well known Linde Buzo Gray (LBG) algorithm and Kekre's Proportionate Error (KPE) Algorithm. Constant error is added every time to split the clusters in LBG, resulting in formation of cluster in one direction which is 1350 in 2-dimensional case. Because of this reason clustering is inefficient resulting in high MSE in LBG. To overcome this drawback of LBG proportionate error is added to change the cluster orientation in KPE. Though the cluster orientation in KPE is changed its variation is limited to +/- 450 over 1350. The proposed algorithm takes care of this problem by introducing new orientation every time to split the clusters. The proposed method reduces PSNR by 2db to 5db for codebook size 128 to 1024 with respect to LBG.",

	{'abstract': u'Coding over subsets (known as generations) rather than over all content blocks in P2P distribution networks and other applications is necessary for a number of practical reasons such as computational complexity. A penalty for coding only within generations is an overall throughput reduction. It has been previously shown that allowing contiguous generations to overlap in a head-to-toe manner improves the throughput. We here propose and study a scheme, referred to as the , that creates shared packets between any two generations at random rather than only the neighboring ones. By optimizing very few design parameters, we obtain a simple scheme that outperforms both the non-overlapping and the head-to-toe overlapping schemes of comparable computational complexity, both in the expected throughput and in the rate of convergence of the probability of decoding failure to zero. We provide a practical algorithm for accurate analysis of the expected throughput of the random annex code for finite-length information. This algorithm enables us to quantify the throughput vs.computational complexity tradeoff, which is necessary for optimal selection of the scheme parameters.',

	{'abstract': u"We consider the computational complexity of pure Nash equilibria in graphical games. It is known that the problem is NP-complete in general, but tractable (i.e., in P) for special classes of graphs such as those with bounded treewidth. It is then natural to ask: is it possible to characterize all tractable classes of graphs for this problem? In this work, we provide such a characterization for the case of bounded in-degree graphs, thereby resolving the gap between existing hardness and tractability results. In particular, we analyze the complexity of PUREGG(C, -), the problem of deciding the existence of pure Nash equilibria in graphical games whose underlying graphs are restricted to class C. We prove that, under reasonable complexity theoretic assumptions, for every recursively enumerable class C of directed graphs with bounded in-degree, PUREGG(C, -) is in polynomial time if and only if the reduced graphs (the graphs resulting from iterated removal of sinks) of C have bounded treewidth. We also give a characterization for PURECHG(C,-), the problem of deciding the existence of pure Nash equilibria in colored hypergraphical games, a game representation that can express the additional structure that some of the players have identical local utility functions. We show that the tractable classes of bounded-arity colored hypergraphical games are precisely those whose reduced graphs have bounded treewidth modulo homomorphic equivalence. Our proofs make novel use of Grohe's characterization of the complexity of homomorphism problems.",

Heterogeneous architectures combine high floating point performance many-core units hosted in conventional server nodes. Examples include Graphics Processing Units (GPU's) and Cell. They have potentially large gains in performance, at modest power and monetary cost. We implemented a magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) simulation code on a variety of heterogeneous and multi-core architectures --- multi-core x86, Cell, Nvidia and ATI GPU --- in different languages, FORTRAN, C, Cell, CUDA and OpenCL. We present initial performance results for these systems. To our knowledge, this is the widest comparison of heterogeneous systems for MHD simulations. We review the different challenges faced in each architecture, and potential bottlenecks. We conclude that substantial gains in performance over traditional systems are possible, and in particular that is possible to extract a greater percentage of peak theoretical performance from some systems when compared to x86 architectures.",

Rate distortion theory is shown to be a natural choice to develop such a framework which includes the following: modeling of data sources, developing application independent utility and privacy metrics, quantifying utility-privacy tradeoffs irrespective of the type of data sources or the methods of providing privacy, developing a side-information model for dealing with questions of external knowledge, and studying a successive disclosure problem for multiple query data sources.',

But FCM is highly vulnerable to noise since it uses only intensity values for clustering the images. This paper aims to develop a novel and efficient fuzzy spatial c-means clustering algorithm which is robust to noise. The proposed clustering algorithm uses fuzzy spatial information to calculate membership value. The input image is clustered using proposed ISFCM algorithm. A comparative study has been made between the conventional FCM and proposed ISFCM. The proposed approach is found to be outperforming the conventional FCM.',

	{'abstract': u'In this paper, we characterize the information-theoretic capacity scaling of wireless ad hoc networks with randomly distributed nodes. By using an exact channel model from Maxwell\'s equations, we successfully resolve the conflict in the literature between the linear capacity scaling by "zg "r et al. and the degrees of freedom limit given as the ratio of the network diameter and the wavelength by Franceschetti et al. In dense networks where the network area is fixed, the capacity scaling is given as the minimum of and the degrees of freedom limit to within an arbitrarily small exponent. In extended networks where the network area is linear in , the capacity scaling is given as the minimum of and the degrees of freedom limit to within an arbitrarily small exponent. Hence, we recover the linear capacity scaling by "zg "r et al. if in dense networks and if in extended networks. Otherwise, the capacity scaling is given as the degrees of freedom limit characterized by Franceschetti et al. For achievability, a modified hierarchical cooperation is proposed based on a lower bound on the capacity of multiple-input multiple-output channel between two node clusters using our channel model.',

	{'abstract': u"The applications of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) contain a wide variety of scenarios. In most of them, the network is composed of a significant number of nodes deployed in an extensive area in which not all nodes are directly connected. Then, the data exchange is supported by multihop communications. Routing protocols are in charge of discovering and maintaining the routes in the network. However, the correctness of a particular routing protocol mainly depends on the capabilities of the nodes and on the application requirements. This paper presents a dynamic discover routing method for communication between sensor nodes and a base station in WSN. This method tolerates failures of arbitrary individual nodes in the network (node failure) or a small part of the network (area failure). Each node in the network does only local routing preservation, needs to record only its neighbor nodes' information, and incurs no extra routing overhead during failure free periods. It dynamically discovers new routes when an intermediate node or a small part of the network in the path from a sensor node to a base station fails. In our planned method, every node decides its path based only on local information, such as its parent node and neighbor nodes' routing information. So, it is possible to form a loop in the routing path. We believe that the loop problem in sensor network routing is not as serious as that in the Internet routing or traditional mobile ad-hoc routing. We are trying to find all possible loops and eliminate the loops as far as possible in WSN.",

	{'abstract': u'We study the spread of influence in a social network based on the Linear Threshold model. We derive an analytical expression for evaluating the expected size of the eventual influenced set for a given initial set, using the probability of activation for each node in the social network. We then provide an equivalent interpretation for the influence spread, in terms of acyclic path probabilities in the Markov chain obtained by reversing the edges in the social network influence graph. We use some properties of such acyclic path probabilities to provide an alternate proof for the submodularity of the influence function. We illustrate the usefulness of the analytical expression in estimating the most influential set, in special cases such as the UILT(Uniform Influence Linear Threshold), USLT(Uniform Susceptance Linear Threshold) and node-degree based influence models. We show that the PageRank heuristic is either provably optimal or performs very well in the above models, and explore its limitations in more general cases. Finally, based on the insights obtained from the analytical expressions, we provide an efficient algorithm which approximates the greedy algorithm for the influence maximization problem.',

Centralized data mining to discover useful patterns in distributed databases isn't always feasible because merging data sets from different sites incurs huge network communication costs. In this paper, an Improved algorithm based on good performance level for data mining is being proposed. In local sites, it runs the application based on the improved LMatrix algorithm, which is used to calculate local support counts. Local Site also finds a centre site to manage every message exchanged to obtain all globally frequent item sets. It also reduces the time of scan of partition database by using LMatrix which increases the performance of the algorithm. Therefore, the research is to develop a distributed algorithm for geographically distributed data sets that reduces communication costs, superior running efficiency, and stronger scalability than direct application of a sequential algorithm in distributed databases.",

We consider a conservative scenario, when the active eavesdropper can choose its strategy based on the legitimate transmitter-receiver pair's strategy -- and thus the transmitter and legitimate receiver have to plan for the worst.

The controller incorporates a fuzzy logic [8] [9] approach for steering and speed control [37], a FL approach for ultrasound sensing and an overall expert system for guidance. The advantages of a modular system are related to portability and transportability, i.e. any vehicle can become autonomous with minimal modifications. A mobile robot test bed has been constructed in university of Cincinnati using a golf cart base. This cart has full speed control with guidance provided by a vision system and obstacle avoidance using ultrasonic sensors. The speed and steering fuzzy logic controller is supervised through a multi-axis motion controller. The obstacle avoidance system is based on a microcontroller interfaced with ultrasonic transducers. This micro-controller independently handles all timing and distance calculations and sends distance information back to the fuzzy logic controller via the serial line. This design yields a portable independent system in which high speed computer communication is not necessary. Vision guidance has been accomplished with the use of CCD cameras judging the current position of the robot.[34] [35][36] It will be generating a good image for reducing an uncertain wrong command from ground coordinate to tackle the parameter uncertainties of the system, and to obtain good WMR dynamic response.[1] Here we Apply 3D line following mythology. It transforms from 3D to 2D and also maps the image coordinates and vice versa, leading to the improved accuracy of the WMR position. ...',

	{'abstract': u'Heterogeneous Networks is the integration of all existing networks under a single environment with an understanding between the functional operations and also includes the ability to make use of multiple broadband transport technologies and to support generalized mobility. It is a challenging feature for Heterogeneous networks to integrate several IP-based access technologies in a seamless way. The focus of this paper is on the requirements of a mobility management scheme for multimedia real-time communication services - Mobile Video Conferencing. Nowadays, the range of available wireless access network technologies includes cellular or wide-area wireless systems, such as cellular networks (GSM/GPRS/UMTS) or Wi-Max, local area Network or personal area wireless systems, comprising for example, WLAN (802.11 a/b/g) and Bluetooth. As the mobile video conferencing is considered, the more advanced mobile terminals are capable of having more than one interface active at the same time. In addition, the heterogeneity of access technologies and also the seamless flow of information will increase in the future, making the seamless integration of the access network a key challenge for mobility management in a heterogeneous network environment. Services must be provided to the user regardless of the particular access technology and also the type of service provider or the network used.',

	{'abstract': u"Specifying QoS properties can limit the selection of some good web services that the user will have considered; this is because the algorithm used strictly ensures that there is a match between QoS properties of the consumer with that of the available services. This is to say that, a situation may arise that some services might not have all that the user specifies but are rated high in those they have. With some tradeoffs specified in form of weight, these services will be made available to the user for consideration. This assertion is from the fact that, the user's requirements for the specified QoS properties are of varying degree i.e. he will always prefer one ahead of the other. This can be captured in form of weight i.e. the one preferred most will have the highest weight. If a consumer specifies light weight for those QoS properties that a web service is deficient in and high weight for those it has, this will minimize the difference between them. Hence the service can be returned.",

	{'abstract': u'This paper investigates, using prior shape models and the concept of ball scale (b-scale), ways of automatically recognizing objects in 3D images without performing elaborate searches or optimization. That is, the goal is to place the model in a single shot close to the right pose (position, orientation, and scale) in a given image so that the model boundaries fall in the close vicinity of object boundaries in the image. This is achieved via the following set of key ideas: (a) A semi-automatic way of constructing a multi-object shape model assembly. (b) A novel strategy of encoding, via b-scale, the pose relationship between objects in the training images and their intensity patterns captured in b-scale images. (c) A hierarchical mechanism of positioning the model, in a one-shot way, in a given image from a knowledge of the learnt pose relationship and the b-scale image of the given image to be segmented. The evaluation results on a set of 20 routine clinical abdominal female and male CT data sets indicate the following: (1) Incorporating a large number of objects improves the recognition accuracy dramatically. (2) The recognition algorithm can be thought as a hierarchical framework such that quick replacement of the model assembly is defined as coarse recognition and delineation itself is known as finest recognition. (3) Scale yields useful information about the relationship between the model assembly and any given image such that the recognition results in a placement of the model close to the actual pose without doing any elaborate searches or optimization. (4) Effective object recognition can make delineation most accurate.',

The process effectively reduces a given graph to a graph on which becomes polynomial-time solvable, and the new measure more accurately evaluates the efficiency of the process.

	{'abstract': u'Acquisition-to-acquisition signal intensity variations (non-standardness) are inherent in MR images. Standardization is a post processing method for correcting inter-subject intensity variations through transforming all images from the given image gray scale into a standard gray scale wherein similar intensities achieve similar tissue meanings. The lack of a standard image intensity scale in MRI leads to many difficulties in tissue characterizability, image display, and analysis, including image segmentation. This phenomenon has been documented well; however, effects of standardization on medical image registration have not been studied yet. In this paper, we investigate the influence of intensity standardization in registration tasks with systematic and analytic evaluations involving clinical MR images. We conducted nearly 20,000 clinical MR image registration experiments and evaluated the quality of registrations both quantitatively and qualitatively. The evaluations show that intensity variations between images degrades the accuracy of registration performance. The results imply that the accuracy of image registration not only depends on spatial and geometric similarity but also on the similarity of the intensity values for the same tissues in different images.',

	{'abstract': u'It has been shown by Indyk and Sidiropoulos [IS07] that any graph of genus g&gt;0 can be stochastically embedded into a distribution over planar graphs with distortion 2^O(g). This bound was later improved to O(g^2) by Borradaile, Lee and Sidiropoulos [BLS09]. We give an embedding with distortion O(log g), which is asymptotically optimal. Apart from the improved distortion, another advantage of our embedding is that it can be computed in polynomial time. In contrast, the algorithm of [BLS09] requires solving an NP-hard problem. Our result implies in particular a reduction for a large class of geometric optimization problems from instances on genus-g graphs, to corresponding ones on planar graphs, with a O(log g) loss factor in the approximation guarantee.',

These mechanisms aim to normalize citation counts for the field and the year in which a publication was published. One mechanism is applied in the current so-called crown indicator of our institute. The other mechanism is applied in the new crown indicator that our institute is planning to adopt. We find that at high aggregation levels, such as at the level of large research institutions or at the level of countries, the differences between the two mechanisms are very small. At lower aggregation levels, such as at the level of research groups or at the level of journals, the differences between the two mechanisms are somewhat larger. We pay special attention to the way in which recent publications are handled. These publications typically have very low citation counts and should therefore be handled with special care.',

	{'abstract': u'Complex information extraction (IE) pipelines assembled by plumbing together off-the-shelf operators, specially customized operators, and operators re-used from other text processing pipelines are becoming an integral component of most text processing frameworks. A critical task faced by the IE pipeline user is to run a post-mortem analysis on the output. Due to the diverse nature of extraction operators (often implemented by independent groups), it is time consuming and error-prone to describe operator semantics formally or operationally to a provenance system. We introduce the first system that helps IE users analyze pipeline semantics and infer provenance interactively while debugging. This allows the effort to be proportional to the need, and to focus on the portions of the pipeline under the greatest suspicion. We present a generic debugger for running post-execution analysis of any IE pipeline consisting of arbitrary types of operators. We propose an effective provenance model for IE pipelines which captures a variety of operator types, ranging from those for which full or no specifications are available. We present a suite of algorithms to effectively build provenance and facilitate debugging. Finally, we present an extensive experimental study on large-scale real-world extractions from an index of ~500 million Web documents.',

	{'abstract': u'The previous link adaptation algorithms on ofdm based systems use equal modulation order for all sub carrier index within a block. For multimedia transmission using ofdm as the modulation technique, unequal constellation is used within one ofdm subcarrier block, a set of subcarriers for audio and another set for video transmissions. A generic model has been shown for such a transmission and link adaptation algorithm has been proposed using EESM (Effective Exponential SNR mapping) method as basic method. Mathematical model has been derived for the channel based on bivariate Gaussian distribution in which the amplitude varies two dimensionally in the same envelope. From the Moment generating function of bivariate distribution, Probability of error has been theoretically derived. Results have been shown for BER performance of an ofdm system using unequal constellation. BER performances have been shown for different values of correlation parameter and fading figure.',

	{'abstract': u'Message passing type algorithms such as the so-called Belief Propagation algorithm have recently gained a lot of attention in the statistics, signal processing and machine learning communities as attractive algorithms for solving a variety of optimization and inference problems. As a decentralized, easy to implement and empirically successful algorithm, BP deserves attention from the theoretical standpoint, and here not much is known at the present stage. In order to fill this gap we consider the performance of the BP algorithm in the context of the capacitated minimum-cost network flow problem - the classical problem in the operations research field. We prove that BP converges to the optimal solution in the pseudo-polynomial time, provided that the optimal solution of the underlying problem is unique and the problem input is integral. Moreover, we present a simple modification of the BP algorithm which gives a fully polynomial-time randomized approximation scheme (FPRAS) for the same problem, which no longer requires the uniqueness of the optimal solution. This is the first instance where BP is proved to have fully-polynomial running time. Our results thus provide a theoretical justification for the viability of BP as an attractive method to solve an important class of optimization problems.',

	{'abstract': u"In a video on demand system, the main video repository may be far away from the user and generally has limited streaming capacities. Since a high quality video's size is huge, it requires high bandwidth for streaming over the internet. In order to achieve a higher video hit ratio, reduced client waiting time, distributed server's architecture can be used, in which multiple local servers are placed close to clients and, based on their regional demands video contents are cached dynamically from the main server. As the cost of proxy server is decreasing and demand for reduced waiting time is increasing day by day, newer architectures are explored, innovative schemes are arrived at. In this paper we present novel 3 layer architecture, includes main multimedia server, a Tracker and Proxy servers. This architecture targets to optimize the client waiting time. We also propose an efficient prefix caching and load sharing algorithm at the proxy server to allocate the cache according to regional popularity of the video. The simulation results demonstrate that it achieves significantly lower client's waiting time, when compared to the other existing algorithms.",

	{'abstract': u"We introduce a new class of games called the networked common goods game (NCGG), which generalizes the well-known common goods game. We focus on a fairly general subclass of the game where each agent's utility functions are the same across all goods the agent is entitled to and satisfy certain natural properties (diminishing return and smoothness). We give a comprehensive set of technical results listed as follows. * We show the optimization problem faced by a single agent can be solved efficiently in this subclass. The discrete version of the problem is however NP-hard but admits an fully polynomial time approximation scheme (FPTAS). * We show uniqueness results of pure strategy Nash equilibrium of NCGG, and that the equilibrium is fully characterized by the structure of the network and independent of the choices and combinations of agent utility functions. * We show NCGG is a potential game, and give an implementation of best/better response Nash dynamics that lead to fast convergence to an -approximate pure strategy Nash equilibrium. * Lastly, we show the price of anarchy of NCGG can be as large as (for any ), which means selfish behavior in NCGG can lead to extremely inefficient social outcomes.",

An especially important estimation is to find the number of distinct elements in a data stream, which is generally referred to as the zeroth frequency moment and denoted by . In this paper, we consider streams of rectangles defined over a discrete space and the task is to compute the total number of distinct points covered by the rectangles. This is known as the Klee's measure problem in 2 dimensions. We present and analyze a randomized streaming approximation algorithm which gives an -approximation of for the total area of Klee's measure problem in 2 dimensions. Our algorithm achieves the following complexity bounds: (a) the amortized processing time per rectangle is ; (b) the space complexity is bits; and (c) the time to answer a query for is , respectively.

	{'abstract': u'In order to achieve fault tolerance, highly reliable system often require the ability to detect errors as soon as they occur and prevent the speared of erroneous information throughout the system. Thus, the need for codes capable of detecting and correcting byte errors are extremely important since many memory systems use b-bit-per-chip organization. Redundancy on the chip must be put to make fault-tolerant design available. This paper examined several methods of computer memory systems, and then a proposed technique is designed to choose a suitable method depending on the organization of memory systems. The constructed codes require a minimum number of check bits with respect to codes used previously, then it is optimized to fit the organization of memory systems according to the requirements for data and byte lengths.',

	{'abstract': u'The problem of network coding for multicasting a single source to multiple sinks has first been studied by Ahlswede, Cai, Li and Yeung in 2000, in which they have established the celebrated max-flow mini-cut theorem on non-physical information flow over a network of independent channels. On the other hand, in 1980, Han has studied the case with correlated multiple sources and a single sink from the viewpoint of polymatroidal functions in which a necessary and sufficient condition has been demonstrated for reliable transmission over the network. This paper presents an attempt to unify both cases, which leads to establish a necessary and sufficient condition for reliable transmission over a noisy network for multicasting all the correlated multiple sources to all the multiple sinks. Furthermore, we address also the problem of transmitting "independent" sources over a multiple-access-type of network as well as over a broadcast-type of network, which reveals that the (co-) polymatroidal structures are intrinsically involved in these types of network coding.',

The framework is derived by the application of the Goal Question Metric Paradigm. This paper aims to describe an application of the framework by considering different visualization tools/CASE tools which are used to visualize the models in different views and to capture the information of models during their evolution.

Routing of data in VANETs is a challenging task due to rapidly changing topology and high speed mobility of vehicles. Conventional routing protocols in MANETs (Mobile Ad hoc Networks) are unable to fully address the unique characteristics in vehicular networks. In this paper, we propose EBGR (Edge Node Based Greedy Routing), a reliable greedy position based routing approach to forward packets to the node present in the edge of the transmission range of source/forwarding node as most suitable next hop, with consideration of nodes moving in the direction of the destination. We propose Revival Mobility model (RMM) to evaluate the performance of our routing technique. This paper presents a detailed description of our approach and simulation results show that packet delivery ratio is improved considerably compared to other routing techniques of VANET.',

	{'abstract': u'The Application of Bio Inspired Algorithms to complicated Power System Stability Problems has recently attracted the researchers in the field of Artificial Intelligence. Low frequency oscillations after a disturbance in a Power system, if not sufficiently damped, can drive the system unstable. This paper provides a systematic procedure to damp the low frequency oscillations based on Bio Inspired Genetic (GA) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithms. The proposed controller design is based on formulating a System Damping ratio enhancement based Optimization criterion to compute the optimal controller parameters for better stability. The Novel and contrasting feature of this work is the mathematical modeling and simulation of the Synchronous generator model including the Steam Governor Turbine (GT) dynamics. To show the robustness of the proposed controller, Non linear Time domain simulations have been carried out under various system operating conditions. Also, a detailed Comparative study has been done to show the superiority of the Bio inspired algorithm based controllers over the Conventional Lead lag controller.',

	{'abstract': u'Several different measures for digraph width have appeared in the last few years. However, none of them shares all the "nice" properties of treewidth: First, being emph i.e. admitting polynomial-time algorithms for all -definable problems on digraphs of bounded width. And, second, having nice emph i.e. being monotone under taking subdigraphs and some form of arc contractions. As for the former, (undirected) seems to be the least common denominator of all reasonably expressive logical languages on digraphs that can speak about the edge/arc relation on the vertex set.The latter property is a necessary condition for a width measure to be characterizable by some version of the cops-and-robber game characterizing the ordinary treewidth. Our main result is that emph algorithmically useful and structurally nice digraph measure cannot be substantially different from the treewidth of the underlying undirected graph. Moreover, we introduce emph and argue that they are the weakest useful notion of minors for digraphs.',

	{'abstract': u'Recently, the academic community has been giving much attention to Cooperative Learning System, a group learning method combined with pedagogy and social psychology. It allows group members to gain knowledge through collaborations and interactions. Nowadays, most Internet cooperative learning systems are designed to provide students mainly with a convenient online environment to study theoretical courses but rarely with an online environment to operate practical instruments. Hence, this paper designed a 3D online cooperative learning system for operating virtual instruments with circuit-measuring function. By integrating with Virtual Reality, Remote Control Parameter Transmission and embedded system techniques, this system gives learners not only a cooperative learning environment via networking to jointly operate the 3D virtual instruments (for example, multi-meters, power supplies and oscilloscopes) but also the functions of instant messages and 3D puzzles to interact with one another. Therefore, learners can effectively improve learning interests and results.',

	{'abstract': u"Coordinated checkpointing is an effective fault tolerant technique in distributed system as it avoids the domino effect and require minimum storage requirement. Most of the earlier coordinated checkpoint algorithms block their computation during checkpointing and forces minimum-process or non-blocking but forces all nodes to takes checkpoint even though many of them may not be necessary or non-blocking minimum-process but takes useless checkpoints or reduced useless checkpoint but has higher synchronization message overhead or has high checkpoint request propagation time. Hence in mobile distributed systems there is a great need of minimizing the number of communication message and checkpointing overhead as it raise new issues such as mobility, low bandwidth of wireless channels, frequently disconnections, limited battery power and lack of reliable stable storage on mobile nodes. In this paper, we propose a minimum-process coordinated checkpointing algorithm for mobile distributed system where no useless checkpoints are taken, no blocking of processes takes place and enforces a minimum-number of processes to take checkpoints. Our algorithm imposes low memory and computation overheads on MH's and low communication overheads on wireless channels. It avoids awakening of an MH if it is not required to take its checkpoint and has reduced latency time as each process involved in a global checkpoint can forward its own decision directly to the checkpoint initiator.",

	{'abstract': u"Privacy of users in P2P networks goes far beyond their current usage and is a fundamental requirement to the adoption of P2P protocols for legal usage. In a climate of cold war between these users and anti-piracy groups, more and more users are moving to anonymizing networks in an attempt to hide their identity. However, when not designed to protect users information, a P2P protocol would leak information that may compromise the identity of its users. In this paper, we first present three attacks targeting BitTorrent users on top of Tor that reveal their real IP addresses. In a second step, we analyze the Tor usage by BitTorrent users and compare it to its usage outside of Tor. Finally, we depict the risks induced by this de-anonymization and show that users' privacy violation goes beyond BitTorrent traffic and contaminates other protocols such as HTTP.",

	{'abstract': u'Wireless Capsule Endoscopy (WCE) is device to detect abnormalities in colon,esophagus,small intestinal and stomach, to distinguish bleeding in WCE images from non bleeding is a hard job by human reviewing and very time consuming. Consequently, automation for classifying bleeding frames not only will expedite the process but will reduce the burden on the doctors. Using the purity of the red color we can detect the Bleeding areas in WCE images. But, we could find various intensity of red color values in different parts of the small intestinal,so it is not enough to depend on the red color feature alone. We select RGB(Red,Green,Blue) because it takes raw level values and it is easy to use. In this paper we will put range ratio color for each of R,G,and B. Therefore, we divide each image into multiple pixels and apply the range ratio color condition for each pixel. Then we count the number of the pixels that achieved our condition. If the number of pixels grater than zero, then the frame is classified as a bleeding type. Otherwise, it is a non-bleeding. Our experimental results show that this method could achieve a very high accuracy in detecting bleeding images for the different parts of the small intestinal',

	{'abstract': u'Today, SIP is a protocol par Excellence in the field of communication over Internet. But, the fact that it belongs to the application layer constitutes a weakness vis-a-vis the NAT traversal. This weakness is due to the way in which the server replies to the requests of clients on the one hand. On the other, it is caused by the dynamic allocation of UDP ports for emission and reception of packets RTP/RTCP. The TURN Protocol may face this weakness. However, its use requires a certain number of exchanges between the clients and a TURN server before establishing the multimedia sessions and this increase the latent time. In this article, we propose to adapt TURN protocol for applications based on SIP protocol such as telephony over Internet, conference video, etc. This adaptation optimises the establishment of multimedia sessions by integrating a manager of TCP connections and multimedia flow controller into SIP Proxy server.',

In order to progressively introduce configuration data and then simplify the proof obligations, we use the B refinement process. We present a case study modeling a network monitor. This program, described by refinement following the layers of the TCP/IP suite protocol, has to warn for all observed events which do not respect the security policy. To design this model, we use the event-B method because it is suitable for modeling network concepts.

	{'abstract': u'Sharing musical files via the Internet was the essential motivation of early P2P systems. Despite of the great success of the P2P file sharing systems, these systems support only "simple" queries. The focus in such systems is how to carry out an efficient query routing in order to find the nodes storing a desired file. Recently, several research works have been made to extend P2P systems to be able to share data having a fine granularity (i.e. atomic attribute) and to process queries written with a highly expressive language (i.e. SQL). These works have led to the emergence of P2P data sharing systems that represent a new generation of P2P systems and, on the other hand, a next stage in a long period of the database research area. ? The characteristics of P2P systems (e.g. large-scale, node autonomy and instability) make impractical to have a global catalog that represents often an essential component in traditional database systems. Usually, such a catalog stores information about data, schemas and data sources. Query routing and processing are two problems affected by the absence of a global catalog. Locating relevant data sources and generating a close to optimal execution plan become more difficult. In this paper, we concentrate our study on proposed solutions for the both problems. Furthermore, selected case studies of main P2P data sharing systems are analyzed and compared.',

We present the application of a rigorous optimization technique based on fuzzy genetic algorithms (FGAs), the optimizing algorithm is obtained by adjusting control parameters of a standard version of genetic algorithm (SGAs) using a fuzzy controller (FLC) depending on the best individual fitness and the population diversity measurements (PDM). The presented optimization algorithms were previously checked on specific mathematical test function and show their superior capabilities with respect to the standard version (SGAs). A planar array with rectangular cells using a probe feed is considered. Included example using FGA demonstrates the good agreement between the desired and calculated radiation patterns than those obtained by a SGA.',

	{'abstract': u'We exhibit incentive compatible multi-unit auctions that are not affine maximizers (i.e., are not of the VCG family) and yet approximate the social welfare to within a factor of . For the case of two-item two-bidder auctions we show that these auctions, termed Triage auctions, are the only scalable ones that give an approximation factor better than 2. "Scalable" means that the allocation does not depend on the units in which the valuations are measured. We deduce from this that any scalable computationally-efficient incentive-compatible auction for items and bidders cannot approximate the social welfare to within a factor better than 2. This is in contrast to arbitrarily good approximations that can be reached under computational constraints alone, and in contrast to the fact that the optimal social welfare can be obtained under incentive constraints alone.',

	{'abstract': u'Content Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) systems based on shape using invariant image moments, viz., Moment Invariants (MI) and Zernike Moments (ZM) are available in the literature. MI and ZM are good at representing the shape features of an image. However, non-orthogonality of MI and poor reconstruction of ZM restrict their application in CBIR. Therefore, an efficient and orthogonal moment based CBIR system is needed. Legendre Moments (LM) are orthogonal, computationally faster, and can represent image shape features compactly. CBIR system using Exact Legendre Moments (ELM) for gray scale images is proposed in this work. Superiority of the proposed CBIR system is observed over other moment based methods, viz., MI and ZM in terms of retrieval efficiency and retrieval time. Further, the classification efficiency is improved by employing Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. Improved retrieval results are obtained over existing CBIR algorithm based on Stacked Euler Vector (SERVE) combined with Modified Moment Invariants (MMI).',

Any sector needs to understand changing need of customer. In order to satisfy financial need for customer banks are taking help of new technology such as internet. Only problem remain is of security. The aim of this work is to provide a secure environment in terms of security for transaction by various ways. In order to improve security we are making use of "Steganography" technique in the way never used before. Task of enhancing security include construction of formula for both data encryption and also for hiding pattern.

	{'abstract': u'In this paper, we propose an efficient client-to-client streaming approach to cooperatively stream the video using chaining technique with unicast communication among the clients. This approach considers two major issues of VoD 1) Prefix caching scheme to accommodate more number of videos closer to client, so that the request-service delay for the user can be minimized. 2) Cooperative proxy and client chaining scheme for streaming the videos using unicasting. This approach minimizes the client rejection rate and bandwidth requirement on server to proxy and proxy to client path. Our simulation results show that the proposed approach achieves reduced client waiting time and optimal prefix caching of videos minimizing server to proxy path bandwidth usage by utilizing the client to client bandwidth, which is occasionally used when compared to busy server to proxy path bandwidth.',

	{'abstract': u'We consider a Gaussian two-hop network where the source and the destination can communicate only via a relay node who is both an eavesdropper and a Byzantine adversary. Both the source and the destination nodes are allowed to transmit, and the relay receives a superposition of their transmitted signals. We propose a new coding scheme that satisfies two requirements simultaneously: the transmitted message must be kept secret from the relay node, and the destination must be able to detect any Byzantine attack that the relay node might launch reliably and fast. The three main components of the scheme are the nested lattice code, the privacy amplification and the algebraic manipulation detection (AMD)code. Specifically, for the Gaussian two-hop network, we show that lattice coding can successfully pair with AMD codes enabling its first application to a noisy channel model. We prove, using this new coding scheme, that the probability that the Byzantine attack goes undetected decreases exponentially fast with respect to the number of channel uses, while the loss in the secrecy rate, compared to the rate achievable when the relay is honest, can be made arbitrarily small. In addition, in contrast with prior work in Gaussian channels, the notion of secrecy provided here is strong secrecy.',

	{'abstract': u'Managing the transactions in real time distributed computing system is not easy, as it has heterogeneously networked computers to solve a single problem. If a transaction runs across some different sites, it may commit at some sites and may failure at another site, leading to an inconsistent transaction. The complexity is increase in real time applications by placing deadlines on the response time of the database system and transactions processing. Such a system needs to process Transactions before these deadlines expired. A series of simulation study have been performed to analyze the performance under different transaction management under conditions such as different workloads, distribution methods, execution mode-distribution and parallel etc. The scheduling of data accesses are done in order to meet their deadlines and to minimize the number of transactions that missed deadlines. A new concept is introduced to manage the transactions in dynamic ways rather than setting computing parameters in static ways. With this approach, the system gives a significant improvement in performance.',

The sequential pattern mining on progressive databases is relatively very new, in which we progressively discover the sequential patterns in period of interest. Period of interest is a sliding window continuously advancing as the time goes by. As the focus of sliding window changes, the new items are added to the dataset of interest and obsolete items are removed from it and become up to date. In general, the existing proposals do not fully explore the real world scenario, such as items associated with support in data stream applications such as market basket analysis. Thus mining important knowledge from supported frequent items becomes a non trivial research issue.

This paper develops a solution procedure to solve nonlinear programming problems using GP technique by splitting the cost coefficients, constraint coefficients and exponents with the help of binary numbers. The equivalent mathematical programming problems are formulated to find their corresponding value of the objective function based on the duality theorem. The ability of calculating the cost coefficients, constraint coefficients and exponents developed in this paper might help lead to more realistic modeling efforts in engineering design areas.

	{'abstract': u'Index Coding has received considerable attention recently motivated in part by real-world applications and in part by its connection to Network Coding. The basic setting of Index Coding encodes the problem input as an undirected graph and the fundamental parameter is the broadcast rate , the average communication cost per bit for sufficiently long messages (i.e. the non-linear vector capacity). Recent nontrivial bounds on were derived from the study of other Index Coding capacities (e.g. the scalar capacity ) by Bar-Yossef et al (2006), Lubetzky and Stav (2007) and Alon et al (2008). However, these indirect bounds shed little light on the behavior of : there was no known polynomial-time algorithm for approximating in a general network to within a nontrivial (i.e. ) factor, and the exact value of remained unknown for any graph where Index Coding is nontrivial. Our main contribution is a direct information-theoretic analysis of the broadcast rate using linear programs, in contrast to previous approaches that compared with graph-theoretic parameters. This allows us to resolve the aforementioned two open questions. We provide a polynomial-time algorithm with a nontrivial approximation ratio for computing in a general network along with a polynomial-time decision procedure for recognizing instances with . In addition, we pinpoint precisely for various classes of graphs (e.g. for various Cayley graphs of cyclic groups) thereby simultaneously improving the previously known upper and lower bounds for these graphs. Via this approach we construct graphs where the difference between and its trivial lower bound is linear in the number of vertices and ones where is uniformly bounded while its upper bound derived from the naive encoding scheme is polynomially worse.',

	{'abstract': u'In this paper we have proposed a dynamic buffer allocation algorithm for the prefix, based on the popularity of the videos. More cache blocks are allocated for most popular videos and a few cache blocks are allocated for less popular videos. Buffer utilization is also maximized irrespective of the load on the Video-on-Demand system. Overload can lead the server getting slowed down. By storing the first few seconds of popular video clips, a multimedia local server can shield the users from the delay, throughput, and loss properties of the path between the local server and the central server. The key idea of controlled multicast is used to allow clients to share a segment of a video stream even when the requests arrive at different times. This dynamic buffer allocation algorithm is simulated and its performance is evaluated based on the buffer utilization by multimedia servers and average buffer allocation for the most popular videos. Our simulation results shows efficient utilization of network bandwidth and reduced hard disk utilization hence resulting in increase in the number of requests being served.',

	{'abstract': u'This paper examines the problem of introducing advanced forms of fault-tolerance via reconfiguration into safety-critical avionic systems. This is required to enable increased availability after fault occurrence in distributed integrated avionic systems(compared to static federated systems). The approach taken is to identify a migration path from current architectures to those that incorporate re-configuration to a lesser or greater degree. Other challenges identified include change of the development process; incremental and flexible timing and safety analyses; configurable kernels applicable for safety-critical systems.',

In novel star schema attribute induction some improvements have been implemented like elimination threshold number as maximum tuples control for generalization result, there is no ANY as the most general concept, replacement the role concept hierarchy with concept tree, simplification for the generalization strategy steps and elimination attribute oriented induction algorithm. Novel star schema attribute induction is more powerful than the current attribute oriented induction since can produce small number final generalization tuples and there is no ANY in the results.',

	{'abstract': u'The stability and convergence of the neural networks are the fundamental characteristics in the Hopfield type networks. Since time delay is ubiquitous in most physical and biological systems, more attention is being made for the delayed neural networks. The inclusion of time delay into a neural model is natural due to the finite transmission time of the interactions. The stability analysis of the neural networks depends on the Lyapunov function and hence it must be constructed for the given system. In this paper we have made an attempt to establish the logarithmic stability of the impulsive delayed neural networks by constructing suitable Lyapunov function.',

	{'abstract': u"Cooperative beamforming in relay networks is considered, in which a source transmits to its destination with the help of a set of cooperating nodes. The source first transmits locally. The cooperating nodes that receive the source signal retransmit a weighted version of it in an amplify-and-forward (AF) fashion. Assuming knowledge of the second-order statistics of the channel state information, beamforming weights are determined so that the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the destination is maximized subject to two different power constraints, i.e., a total (source and relay) power constraint, and individual relay power constraints. For the former constraint, the original problem is transformed into a problem of one variable, which can be solved via Newton's method. For the latter constraint, the original problem is transformed into a homogeneous quadratically constrained quadratic programming (QCQP) problem. In this case, it is shown that when the number of relays does not exceed three the global solution can always be constructed via semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation and the matrix rank-one decomposition technique. For the cases in which the SDP relaxation does not generate a rank one solution, two methods are proposed to solve the problem: the first one is based on the coordinate descent method, and the second one transforms the QCQP problem into an infinity norm maximization problem in which a smooth finite norm approximation can lead to the solution using the augmented Lagrangian method.",

	{'abstract': u'Mobile Ad hoc Networks are highly dynamic networks. Quality of Service (QoS) routing in such networks is usually limited by the network breakage due to either node mobility or energy depletion of the mobile nodes. Also, to fulfill certain quality parameters, presence of multiple node-disjoint paths becomes essential. Such paths aid in the optimal traffic distribution and reliability in case of path breakages. Thus, to cater various challenges in QoS routing in Mobile Add hoc Networks, a Node Disjoint Multipath Routing Considering Link and Node Stability (NDMLNR) protocol has been proposed by the authors. The metric used to select the paths takes into account the stability of the nodes and the corresponding links. This paper studies various challenges in the QoS routing and presents the characteristic evaluation of NDMLNR w.r.t various existing protocols in this area.',

However, due to the limitations in PKI based solutions, some PKI less authentications mechanisms are proposed. This paper aims to present an overview of different authentication methods used in or together with SIP. We start by highlighting the security issues in SIP in the context of VoIP communication. Then we illustrate the current activities regarding the SIP authentication mechanisms including the recent developments in the research community and standardization efforts within the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).

	{'abstract': u'The basic idea behind Cloud computing is that resource providers offer elastic resources to end users. In this paper, we intend to answer one key question to the success of Cloud computing: in Cloud, can small or medium-scale scientific computing communities benefit from the economies of scale? Our research contributions are three-fold: first, we propose an enhanced scientific public cloud model (ESP) that encourages small- or medium-scale organizations to rent elastic resources from a public cloud provider; second, on a basis of the ESP model, we design and implement the DawningCloud system that can consolidate heterogeneous scientific workloads on a Cloud site; third, we propose an innovative emulation methodology and perform a comprehensive evaluation. We found that for two typical workloads: high throughput computing (HTC) and many task computing (MTC), DawningCloud saves the resource consumption maximally by 44.5% (HTC) and 72.6% (MTC) for service providers, and saves the total resource consumption maximally by 47.3% for a resource provider with respect to the previous two public Cloud solutions. To this end, we conclude that for typical workloads: HTC and MTC, DawningCloud can enable scientific communities to benefit from the economies of scale of public Clouds.',

	{'abstract': u"We propose a new algorithm for solving a system of two nonlinear transcendental equations with two complex variables based on the Muller algorithm. The two-dimensional Muller algorithm is tested on systems of different type and is found to work comparably to Newton's method and Broyden's method in many cases. The new algorithm is particularly useful in systems featuring the Heun functions whose complexity may make the already known algorithms not efficient enough or not working at all. In those specific cases, the new algorithm gives distinctly better results than the other two methods. As an example for its application in physics, the new algorithm was used to find the quasi-normal modes (QNM) of Schwarzschild black hole described by the Regge-Wheeler equation. The numerical results obtained by our method are compared with the already published QNM frequencies and are found to coincide to a great extent with them. Also discussed are the QNM of the Kerr black hole, described by the Teukolsky Master equation.",

	{'abstract': u'The importance of finding the characteristics leading to either a success or a failure is one of the driving forces of data mining. The various application areas of finding success/failure factors cover vast variety of areas such as credit risk evaluation and granting loans, micro array analysis, health factors and health risk factors, and parameter combination leading to a product success. This paper presents a new approach for making inferences about dichotomous data. The objective is to determine rules that lead to a certain result. The method consists of four phases: in the first phase, the data is processed into a binary format of a truth table, in the second phase; rules are found by utilizing an algorithm that minimizes Boolean functions. In the third phase the rules are checked and filtered. In the fourth phase, simple rules that involve one to two features are revealed.',

	{'abstract': u'In a virtualized infrastructure where physical resources are shared, a single physical server failure will terminate several virtual servers and crippling the virtual infrastructures which contained those virtual servers. In the worst case, more failures may cascade from overloading the remaining servers. To guarantee some level of reliability, each virtual infrastructure, at instantiation, should be augmented with backup virtual nodes and links that have sufficient capacities. This ensures that, when physical failures occur, sufficient computing resources are available and the virtual network topology is preserved. However, in doing so, the utilization of the physical infrastructure may be greatly reduced. This can be circumvented if backup resources are pooled and shared across multiple virtual infrastructures, and intelligently embedded in the physical infrastructure. These techniques can reduce the physical footprint of virtual backups while guaranteeing reliability.',

	{'abstract': u'In a model-based testing approach as well as for the verification of properties, B models provide an interesting solution. However, for industrial applications, the size of their state space often makes them hard to handle. To reduce the amount of states, an abstraction function can be used, often combining state variable elimination and domain abstractions of the remaining variables. This paper complements previous results, based on domain abstraction for test generation, by adding a preliminary syntactic abstraction phase, based on variable elimination. We define a syntactic transformation that suppresses some variables from a B event model, in addition to a method that chooses relevant variables according to a test purpose. We propose two methods to compute an abstraction A of an initial model M. The first one computes A as a simulation of M, and the second one computes A as a bisimulation of M. The abstraction process produces a finite state system. We apply this abstraction computation to a Model Based Testing process.',

	{'abstract': u'Turbo code is a great achievement in the field of communication system. It can be created by connecting a turbo encoder and a decoder serially. A Turbo encoder is build with parallel concatenation of two simple convolutional codes. By varying the number of memory element (encoder configuration), code rate (1/2 or 1/3), block size of data and iteration, we can achieve better BER performance. Turbo code also consists of interleaver unit and its BER performance also depends on interleaver size. Turbo Decoder can be implemented using different algorithm, but Log -MAP decoding algorithm is less computationaly complex with respect to MAP (maximux a posteriori) algorithm, without compromising its BER performance, nearer to Shannon limit. A register transfer level (RTL) turbo encoder is designed and simulated using VHDL (Very high speed integrated circuit Hardware Description Language). In this paper VHDL model of different turbo encoder are implemented using Log MAP decoder and its performance are compared and verified with corresponding MATLAB simulated results.',

Dimensionality reduction has emerged as one of the significant preprocessing steps in machine learning applications and has been effective in removing inappropriate data, increasing learning accuracy, and improving comprehensibility. Feature redundancy exercises great influence on the performance of classification process. Towards the better classification performance, this paper addresses the usefulness of truncating the highly correlated and redundant attributes. Here, an effort has been made to verify the utility of dimensionality reduction by applying LVQ (Learning Vector Quantization) method on two Benchmark datasets of 'Pima Indian Diabetic patients' and 'Lung cancer patients'.",

Web Usage Mining applies mining techniques in log data to extract the behavior of users which is used in various applications like personalized services, adaptive web sites, customer profiling, prefetching, creating attractive web sites etc., Web usage mining consists of three phases preprocessing, pattern discovery and pattern analysis. Web log data is usually noisy and ambiguous and preprocessing is an important process before mining. For discovering patterns sessions are to be constructed efficiently. This paper reviews existing work done in the preprocessing stage. A brief overview of various data mining techniques for discovering patterns, and pattern analysis are discussed. Finally a glimpse of various applications of web usage mining is also presented.",

This identification is a problem in pattern recognition which either neural networks or support vector machines should prove to be high-speed. Bayesian networks would also provide value but require significant preprocessing of the signals. In this paper, we describe the use of a support vector machine for object identification from synthesized RCS data. Our best results are from data fusion of X-band and S-band signals, where we obtained 99.4%, 95.3%, 100% and 95.6% correct identification for cylinders, frusta, spheres, and polygons, respectively. We also compare our results with a Bayesian approach and show that the SVM is three orders of magnitude faster, as measured by the number of floating point operations.',

Each VPN endpoint specifies bounds on the total amount of traffic that it is likely to send or receive at any time. The network provider tailors the VPN so that there is sufficient bandwidth for any traffic matrix that is consistent with these bounds. The approach incorporates the use of Ad-hoc On demand Distance Vector (AODV) protocol, with a view to accomplish an enhancement in the performance of the mobile networks.

	{'abstract': u'To obtain good system performance, a DBA must choose a set of indices that is appropriate for the workload. The system can aid in this challenging task by providing recommendations for the index configuration. We propose a new index recommendation technique, termed semi-automatic tuning, that keeps the DBA "in the loop" by generating recommendations that use feedback about the DBA\'s preferences. The technique also works online, which avoids the limitations of commercial tools that require the workload to be known in advance. The foundation of our approach is the Work Function Algorithm, which can solve a wide variety of online optimization problems with strong competitive guarantees. We present an experimental analysis that validates the benefits of semi-automatic tuning in a wide variety of conditions.',

	{'abstract': u'Reliable effort estimation remains an ongoing challenge to software engineers. Accurate effort estimation is the state of art of software engineering, effort estimation of software is the preliminary phase between the client and the business enterprise. The relationship between the client and the business enterprise begins with the estimation of the software. The credibility of the client to the business enterprise increases with the accurate estimation. Effort estimation often requires generalizing from a small number of historical projects. Generalization from such limited experience is an inherently under constrained problem. Accurate estimation is a complex process because it can be visualized as software effort prediction, as the term indicates prediction never becomes an actual. This work follows the basics of the empirical software effort estimation models. The goal of this paper is to study the empirical software effort estimation. The primary conclusion is that no single technique is best for all situations, and that a careful comparison of the results of several approaches is most likely to produce realistic estimates.',

	{'abstract': u'Data mining is the task of discovering interesting patterns from large amounts of data. There are many data mining tasks, such as classification, clustering, association rule mining, and sequential pattern mining. Sequential pattern mining finds sets of data items that occur together frequently in some sequences. Sequential pattern mining, which extracts frequent subsequences from a sequence database, has attracted a great deal of interest during the recent data mining research because it is the basis of many applications, such as: web user analysis, stock trend prediction, DNA sequence analysis, finding language or linguistic patterns from natural language texts, and using the history of symptoms to predict certain kind of disease. The diversity of the applications may not be possible to apply a single sequential pattern model to all these problems. Each application may require a unique model and solution. A number of research projects were established in recent years to develop meaningful sequential pattern models and efficient algorithms for mining these patterns. In this paper, we theoretically provided a brief overview three types of sequential patterns model.',

	{'abstract': u'Almost all existing RFID authentication schemes (tag/reader) are vulnerable to relay attacks, because of their inability to estimate the distance to the tag. These attacks are very serious since it can be mounted without the notice of neither the reader nor the tag and cannot be prevented by cryptographic protocols that operate at the application layer. Distance bounding protocols represent a promising way to thwart relay attacks, by measuring the round trip time of short authenticated messages. All the existing distance bounding protocols use random number generator and hash functions at the tag side which make them inapplicable at low cost RFID tags. This paper proposes a lightweight distance bound protocol for low cost RFID tags. The proposed protocol based on modified version of Gossamer mutual authentication protocol. The implementation of the proposed protocol meets the limited abilities of low-cost RFID tags.',

	{'abstract': u'Symmetry is an important feature of many constraint programs. We show that any problem symmetry acting on a set of symmetry breaking constraints can be used to break symmetry. Different symmetries pick out different solutions in each symmetry class. This simple but powerful idea can be used in a number of different ways. We describe one application within model restarts, a search technique designed to reduce the conflict between symmetry breaking and the branching heuristic. In model restarts, we restart search periodically with a random symmetry of the symmetry breaking constraints. Experimental results show that this symmetry breaking technique is effective in practice on some standard benchmark problems.',

	{'abstract': u"Multiprocessor task scheduling is an important and computationally difficult problem. This paper proposes a comparison study of genetic algorithm and list scheduling algorithm. Both algorithms are naturally parallelizable but have heavy data dependencies. Based on experimental results, this paper presents a detailed analysis of the scalability, advantages and disadvantages of each algorithm. Multiprocessors have emerged as a powerful computing means for running real-time applications, especially where a uni-processor system would not be sufficient enough to execute all the tasks. The high performance and reliability of multiprocessors have made them a powerful computing resource. Such computing environment requires an efficient algorithm to determine when and on which processor a given task should execute. In multiprocessor systems, an efficient scheduling of a parallel program onto the processors that minimizes the entire execution time is vital for achieving a high performance. This scheduling problem is known to be NP- Hard. In multiprocessor scheduling problem, a given program is to be scheduled in a given multiprocessor system such that the program's execution time is minimized. The last job must be completed as early as possible. Genetic algorithm (GA) is one of the widely used techniques for constrained optimization.",

	{'abstract': u"Botnet is most widespread and occurs commonly in today's cyber attacks, resulting in serious threats to our network assets and organization's properties. Botnets are collections of compromised computers (Bots) which are remotely controlled by its originator (BotMaster) under a common Command-and-Control (C&amp;C) infrastructure. They are used to distribute commands to the Bots for malicious activities such as distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, spam and phishing. Most of the existing Botnet detection approaches concentrate only on particular Botnet command and control (C&amp;C) protocols (e.g., IRC,HTTP) and structures (e.g., centralized), and can become ineffective as Botnets change their structure and C&amp;C techniques. In this paper at first we provide taxonomy of Botnets C&amp;C channels and evaluate well-known protocols which are being used in each of them. Then we proposed a new general detection framework which currently focuses on P2P based and IRC based Botnets. This proposed framework is based on definition of Botnets. Botnet has been defined as a group of bots that perform similar communication and malicious activity patterns within the same Botnet. The point that distinguishes our proposed detection framework from many other similar works is that there is no need for prior knowledge of Botnets such as Botnet signature.",

	{'abstract': u'Voting is a simple mechanism to combine together the preferences of multiple agents. Agents may try to manipulate the result of voting by mis-reporting their preferences. One barrier that might exist to such manipulation is computational complexity. In particular, it has been shown that it is NP-hard to compute how to manipulate a number of different voting rules. However, NP-hardness only bounds the worst-case complexity. Recent theoretical results suggest that manipulation may often be easy in practice. In this paper, we study empirically the manipulability of single transferable voting (STV) to determine if computational complexity is really a barrier to manipulation. STV was one of the first voting rules shown to be NP-hard. It also appears one of the harder voting rules to manipulate. We sample a number of distributions of votes including uniform and real world elections. In almost every election in our experiments, it was easy to compute how a single agent could manipulate the election or to prove that manipulation by a single agent was impossible.',

	{'abstract': u'The increasing role of home automation in routine life and the rising demand for sensor networks enhanced wireless personal area networks (WPANs) development, pervasiveness of wireless &amp; wired network, and research. Soon arose the need of implementing the Internet Protocol in these devices in order to WPAN standards, raising the way for questions on how to provide seamless communication between wired and wireless technologies. After a quick overview of the Low-rate WPAN standard (IEEE 802.15.4) and the Zigbee stack, this paper focuses on understanding the implications when interconnecting low powered IEEE 802.15.4 devices and a wired IPv6 domain. Subsequently the focus will be on existing approaches to connect LoWPAN devices to the internet and on how these approaches try to solve these challenges, concluding with a critical analysis of interoperability problems.',

	{'abstract': u'This paper introduces a novel indexing and access method, called Feature- Based Adaptive Tolerance Tree (FATT), using wavelet transform is proposed to organize large image data sets efficiently and to support popular image access mechanisms like Content Based Image Retrieval (CBIR).Conventional database systems are designed for managing textual and numerical data and retrieving such data is often based on simple comparisons of text or numerical values. However, this method is no longer adequate for images, since the digital presentation of images does not convey the reality of images. Retrieval of images become difficult when the database is very large. This paper addresses such problems and presents a novel indexing technique, Feature Based Adaptive Tolerance Tree (FATT), which is designed to bring an effective solution especially for indexing large databases. The proposed indexing scheme is then used along with a query by image content, in order to achieve the ultimate goal from the user point of view that is retrieval of all relevant images. FATT indexing technique, features of the image is extracted using 2-dimensional discrete wavelet transform (2DDWT) and index code is generated from the determinant value of the features. Multiresolution analysis technique using 2D-DWT can decompose the image into components at different scales, so that the coarest scale components carry the global approximation information while the finer scale components contain the detailed information. Experimental results show that the FATT outperforms M-tree upto 200%, Slim-tree up to 120% and HCT upto 89%. FATT indexing technique is adopted to increase the efficiently of data storage and retrieval.',

	{'abstract': u"Under Windows operating system, existing I/O benchmarking tools does not allow a developer to efficiently define a file access strategy according to the applications' constraints. This is essentially due to the fact that the existing tools do allow only a restricted set of I/O workloads that does not generally correspond to the target applications. To cope with this problem, we designed and implemented a precise I/O simulator allowing to simulate whatever real I/O trace on a given defined architecture, and in which most of file and disk cache strategies, their interactions and the detailed storage system architecture are implemented. Simulation results on different workloads and architectures show a very high degree of precision. In fact, the mean error rate as compared to real measures is of about 6% with a maximum of 10% on global throughput.",

	{'abstract': u"The performance in higher secondary school education in India is a turning point in the academic lives of all students. As this academic performance is influenced by many factors, it is essential to develop predictive data mining model for students' performance so as to identify the slow learners and study the influence of the dominant factors on their academic performance. In the present investigation, a survey cum experimental methodology was adopted to generate a database and it was constructed from a primary and a secondary source. While the primary data was collected from the regular students, the secondary data was gathered from the school and office of the Chief Educational Officer (CEO). A total of 1000 datasets of the year 2006 from five different schools in three different districts of Tamilnadu were collected. The raw data was preprocessed in terms of filling up missing values, transforming values in one form into another and relevant attribute/ variable selection. As a result, we had 772 student records, which were used for CHAID prediction model construction. A set of prediction rules were extracted from CHIAD prediction model and the efficiency of the generated CHIAD prediction model was found. The accuracy of the present model was compared with other model and it has been found to be satisfactory.",

	{'abstract': u'MKM has been defined as the quest for technologies to manage mathematical knowledge. MKM "in the small" is well-studied, so the real problem is to scale up to large, highly interconnected corpora: "MKM in the large". We contend that advances in two areas are needed to reach this goal. We need representation languages that support incremental processing of all primitive MKM operations, and we need software architectures and implementations that implement these operations scalably on large knowledge bases. We present instances of both in this paper: the MMT framework for modular theory-graphs that integrates meta-logical foundations, which forms the base of the next OMDoc version; and TNTBase, a versioned storage system for XML-based document formats. TNTBase becomes an MMT database by instantiating it with special MKM operations for MMT.',

	{'abstract': u'Time is one of the most difficult aspects to handle in real world applications such as database systems. Relational database management systems proposed by Codd offer very little built-in query language support for temporal data management. The model itself incorporates neither the concept of time nor any theory of temporal semantics. Many temporal extensions of the relational model have been proposed and some of them are also implemented. This paper offers a brief introduction to temporal database research. We propose a conceptual model for handling time varying attributes in the relational database model with minimal temporal attributes.',

	{'abstract': u"The Personality and emotions are effective parameters in learning process. Thus, virtual learning environments should pay attention to these parameters. In this paper, a new e-learning model is designed and implemented according to these parameters. The Virtual learning environment that is presented here uses two agents: Virtual Tutor Agent (VTA), and Virtual Classmate Agent (VCA). During the learning process and depending on events happening in the environment, learner's emotions are changed. In this situation, learning style should be revised according to the personality traits as well as the learner's current emotions. VTA selects suitable learning style for the learners based on their personality traits. To improve the learning process, the system uses VCA in some of the learning steps. VCA is an intelligent agent and has its own personality. It is designed so that it can present an attractive and real learning environment in interaction with the learner. To recognize the learner's personality, this system uses MBTI test and to obtain emotion values uses OCC model. Finally, the results of system tested in real environments show that considering the human features in interaction with the learner increases learning quality and satisfies the learner.",

	{'abstract': u'Self-stabilization is a versatile approach to fault-tolerance since it permits a distributed system to recover from any transient fault that arbitrarily corrupts the contents of all memories in the system. Byzantine tolerance is an attractive feature of distributed systems that permits to cope with arbitrary malicious behaviors. We consider the well known problem of constructing a breadth-first spanning tree in this context. Combining these two properties proves difficult: we demonstrate that it is impossible to contain the impact of Byzantine nodes in a strictly or strongly stabilizing manner. We then adopt the weaker scheme of topology-aware strict stabilization and we present a similar weakening of strong stabilization. We prove that the classical protocol has optimal Byzantine containment properties with respect to these criteria.',

In this work, we address significance in the context of frequent itemset mining. Specifically, we develop a novel methodology to identify a meaningful support threshold s* for a dataset, such that the number of itemsets with support at least s* represents a substantial deviation from what would be expected in a random dataset with the same number of transactions and the same individual item frequencies. These itemsets can then be flagged as statistically significant with a small false discovery rate. We present extensive experimental results to substantiate the effectiveness of our methodology.',

The few approaches that avoid this have rather unsatisfyingly lacked theoretical foundations, or do not scale. We present a learning-to-rank formulation that optimizes the fraction of satisfied users, with several scalable algorithms that explicitly takes document similarity and ranking context into account. Our formulation is a non-trivial common generalization of two multi-armed bandit models from the literature: "ranked bandits" (Radlinski et al., ICML 2008) and "Lipschitz bandits" (Kleinberg et al., STOC 2008). We present theoretical justifications for this approach, as well as a near-optimal algorithm. Our evaluation adds optimizations that improve empirical performance, and shows that our algorithms learn orders of magnitude more quickly than previous approaches.',

In this paper, we generalize the concept to a multi-shift setting: a multi-shift de Bruijn sequence tau(m,n) of shift m and order n is a word such that every word of length n appears exactly once in w as a factor that starts at index im+1 for some integer i&gt;=0. We show the number of the multi-shift de Bruijn sequence tau(m,n) is (a^n)!a^ for 1&lt;=n&lt;=m and is (a^m!)^ for 1&lt;=m&lt;=n, where a=|Sigma|. We provide two algorithms for generating a tau(m,n). The multi-shift de Bruijn sequence is important in solving the Frobenius problem in a free monoid.',

	{'abstract': u"A novel language system has given rise to promising alternatives to standard formal and processor network models of computation. An interstring linked with a abstract machine environment, shares sub-expressions, transfers data, and spatially allocates resources for the parallel evaluation of dataflow. Formal models called the a-Ram family are introduced, designed to support interstring programming languages (interlanguages). Distinct from dataflow, graph rewriting, and FPGA models, a-Ram instructions are bit level and execute in situ. They support sequential and parallel languages without the space/time overheads associated with the Turing Machine and l-calculus, enabling massive programs to be simulated. The devices of one a-Ram model, called the Synchronic A-Ram, are fully connected and simpler than FPGA LUT's. A compiler for an interlanguage called Space, has been developed for the Synchronic A-Ram. Space is MIMD. strictly typed, and deterministic. Barring memory allocation and compilation, modules are referentially transparent. At a high level of abstraction, modules exhibit a state transition system, aiding verification. Data structures and parallel iteration are straightforward to implement, and allocations of sub-processes and data transfers to resources are implicit. Space points towards highly connected architectures called Synchronic Engines, that scale in a GALS manner. Synchronic Engines are more general purpose than systolic arrays and GPUs, and bypass programmability and conflict issues associated with multicores.",

	{'abstract': u'Restoration of digital images from their degraded measurements has always been a problem of great theoretical and practical importance in numerous applications of imaging sciences. A specific solution to the problem of image restoration is generally determined by the nature of degradation phenomenon as well as by the statistical properties of measurement noises. The present study is concerned with the case in which the images of interest are corrupted by convolutional blurs and Poisson noises. To deal with such problems, there exists a range of solution methods which are based on the principles originating from the fixed-point algorithm of Richardson and Lucy (RL). In this paper, we provide conceptual and experimental proof that such methods tend to converge to sparse solutions, which makes them applicable only to those images which can be represented by a relatively small number of non-zero samples in the spatial domain. Unfortunately, the set of such images is relatively small, which restricts the applicability of RL-type methods. On the other hand, virtually all practical images admit sparse representations in the domain of a properly designed linear transform. To take advantage of this fact, it is therefore tempting to modify the RL algorithm so as to make it recover representation coefficients, rather than the values of their associated image. Such modification is introduced in this paper. Apart from the generality of its assumptions, the proposed method is also superior to many established reconstruction approaches in terms of estimation accuracy and computational complexity. This and other conclusions of this study are validated through a series of numerical experiments.',

	{'abstract': u'This philosophical paper proposes a modified version of the scientific method, in which large databases are used instead of experimental observations as the necessary empirical ingredient. This change in the source of the empirical data allows the scientific method to be applied to several aspects of physical reality that previously resisted systematic interrogation. Under the new method, scientific theories are compared by instantiating them as compression programs, and examining the codelengths they achieve on a database of measurements related to a phenomenon of interest. Because of the impossibility of compressing random data, "real world" data can only be compressed by discovering and exploiting the empirical structure it exhibits. The method also provides a new way of thinking about two longstanding issues in the philosophy of science: the problem of induction and the problem of demarcation. The second part of the paper proposes to reformulate computer vision as an empirical science of visual reality, by applying the new method to large databases of natural images. The immediate goal of the proposed reformulation is to repair the chronic difficulties in evaluation experienced by the field of computer vision. The reformulation should bring a wide range of benefits, including a substantially increased degree of methodological rigor, the ability to justify complex theories without overfitting, a scalable evaluation paradigm, and the potential to make systematic progress. A crucial argument is that the change is not especially drastic, because most computer vision tasks can be reformulated as specialized image compression techniques. Finally, a concrete proposal is discussed in which a database is produced by recording from a roadside video camera, and compression is achieved by developing a computational understanding of the appearance of moving cars.',

	{'abstract': u'Let R^d -&gt; A be a query problem over R^d for which there exists a data structure S that can compute P(q) in O(log n) time for any query point q in R^d. Let D be a probability measure over R^d representing a distribution of queries. We describe a data structure called the odds-on tree, of size O(n^ epsilon) that can be used as a filter that quickly computes P(q) for some query values q in R^d and relies on S for the remaining queries. With an odds-on tree, the expected query time for a point drawn according to D is O(H*+1), where H* is a lower-bound on the expected cost of any linear decision tree that solves P. Odds-on trees have a number of applications, including distribution-sensitive data structures for point location in 2-d, point-in-polytope testing in d dimensions, ray shooting in simple polygons, ray shooting in polytopes, nearest-neighbour queries in R^d, point-location in arrangements of hyperplanes in R^d, and many other geometric searching problems that can be solved in the linear-decision tree model. A standard lifting technique extends these results to algebraic decision trees of constant degree. A slightly different version of odds-on trees yields similar results for orthogonal searching problems that can be solved in the comparison tree model.',

	{'abstract': u"The dependency core calculus (DCC), a simple extension of the computational lambda calculus, captures a common notion of dependency that arises in many programming language settings. This notion of dependency is closely related to the notion of information flow in security; it is sensitive not only to data dependencies that cause explicit flows, but also to control dependencies that cause implicit flows. In this paper, we study variants of DCC in which the data and control dependencies are decoupled. This allows us to consider settings where a weaker notion of dependency---one that restricts only explicit flows---may usefully coexist with DCC's stronger notion of dependency. In particular, we show how strong, noninterference-based security may be reconciled with weak, trace-based security within the same system, enhancing soundness of the latter and completeness of the former.",

In this paper, we propose a method for measuring the performance of groups of researchers. The proposed method is called alpha-index and it is based on two parameters: (i) the homogeneity of the h-indexes of the researchers in the group; and (ii) the h-group, which is an extension of the h-index for groups. Our method integrates the concepts of homogeneity and absolute value of the h-index into a single measure which is appropriate for the evaluation of groups. We report on experiments that assess computer science conferences based on the h-indexes of their program committee members. Our results are similar to a manual classification scheme adopted by a research agency.",

Another problem of interest is the single source version of the problem, where there is a special vertex s and all non-zero connectivity requirements must involve s.

	{'abstract': u'We introduce a new approach to model and analyze emph. It is fully based on discrete mathematics and yields a class of mobility models, called the emph Model. This model can be seen as the discrete version of the emph Model including all variants of the emph Model cite. We derive fundamental properties and emph analytical formulas for the emph yielded by the Markov Trace Model. Such results can be exploited to compute formulas and properties for concrete cases of the Markov Trace Model by just applying counting arguments. We apply the above general results to the discrete version of the emph over a square of bounded size. We get formulas for the total stationary distribution and for two important emph ones: the agent spatial and destination distributions. Our method makes the analysis of complex mobile systems a feasible task. As a further evidence of this important fact, we first model a complex vehicular-mobile system over a set of crossing streets. Several concrete issues are implemented such as parking zones, traffic lights, and variable vehicle speeds. By using a emph version of the Markov Trace Model, we get explicit formulas for the stationary distributions yielded by this vehicular-mobile model as well.',

	{'abstract': u'In this paper, pilot-symbol-assisted transmission in cognitive radio systems over time selective flat fading channels is studied. It is assumed that causal and noncausal Wiener filter estimators are used at the secondary receiver with the aid of training symbols to obtain the channel side information (CSI) under an interference power constraint. Cognitive radio model is described together with detection and false alarm probabilities determined by using a Neyman-Person detector for channel sensing. Subsequently, for both filters, the variances of estimate errors are calculated from the Doppler power spectrum of the channel, and achievable rate expressions are provided considering the scenarios which are results of channel sensing. Numerical results are obtained in Gauss-Markov modeled channels, and achievable rates obtained by using causal and noncausal filters are compared and it is shown that the difference is decreasing with increasing signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Moreover, the optimal probability of detection and false alarm values are shown, and the tradeoff between these two parameters is discussed. Finally, optimal power distributions are provided.',

	{'abstract': u'Agile development processes and component-based software architectures are two software engineering approaches that contribute to enable the rapid building and evolution of applications. Nevertheless, few approaches have proposed a framework to combine agile and component-based development, allowing an application to be tested throughout the entire development cycle. To address this problematic, we have built CALICO, a model-based framework that allows applications to be safely developed in an iterative and incremental manner. The CALICO approach relies on the synchronization of a model view, which specifies the application properties, and a runtime view, which contains the application in its execution context. Tests on the application specifications that require values only known at runtime, are automatically integrated by CALICO into the running application, and the captured needed values are reified at execution time to resume the tests and inform the architect of potential problems. Any modification at the model level that does not introduce new errors is automatically propagated to the running system, allowing the safe evolution of the application. In this paper, we illustrate the CALICO development process with a concrete example and provide information on the current implementation of our framework.',

	{'abstract': u'The edit distance problem is a classical fundamental problem in computer science in general, and in combinatorial pattern matching in particular. The standard dynamic programming solution for this problem computes the edit-distance between a pair of strings of total length O(N) in O(N^2) time. To this date, this quadratic upper-bound has never been substantially improved for general strings. However, there are known techniques for breaking this bound in case the strings are known to compress well under a particular compression scheme. The basic idea is to first compress the strings, and then to compute the edit distance between the compressed strings. As it turns out, practically all known o(N^2) edit-distance algorithms work, in some sense, under the same paradigm described above. It is therefore natural to ask whether there is a single edit-distance algorithm that works for strings which are compressed under any compression scheme. A rephrasing of this question is to ask whether a single algorithm can exploit the compressibility properties of strings under any compression method, even if each string is compressed using a di?erent compression. In this paper we set out to answer this question by using straight line programs. These provide a generic platform for representing many popular compression schemes including the LZ-family, Run-Length Encoding, Byte-Pair Encoding, and dictionary methods. For two strings of total length N having straight-line program representations of total size n, we present an algorithm running in O(nN log(N/n)) time for computing the edit-distance of these two strings under any rational scoring function, and an O(n^N^) time algorithm for arbitrary scoring functions. Our new result, while providing a signi cant speed up for highly compressible strings, does not surpass the quadratic time bound even in the worst case scenario.',

	{'abstract': u"An important problem to be solved in modeling head-related impulse responses (HRIRs) is how to individualize HRIRs so that they are suitable for a listener. We modeled the entire magnitude head-related transfer functions (HRTFs), in frequency domain, for sound sources on horizontal plane of 37 subjects using principal components analysis (PCA). The individual magnitude HRTFs could be modeled adequately well by a linear combination of only ten orthonormal basis functions. The goal of this research was to establish multiple linear regression (MLR) between weights of basis functions obtained from PCA and fewer anthropometric measurements in order to individualize a given listener's HRTFs with his or her own anthropomety. We proposed here an improved individualization method based on MLR of weights of basis functions by utilizing 8 chosen out of 27 anthropometric measurements. Our objective experiments' results show a superior performance than that of our previous work on individualizing minimum phase HRIRs and also better than similar research. The proposed individualization method shows that the individualized magnitude HRTFs could approximated well the the original ones with small error. Moving sound employing the reconstructed HRIRs could be perceived as if it was moving around the horizontal plane.",

Specifically we show that the partition function is hard for the complexity class #RHPi_1 under approximation-preserving reducibility. Thus, it is as hard to approximate the partition function as it is to find approximate solutions to a wide range of counting problems, including that of determining the number of independent sets in a bipartite graph. Our proof exploits the first order phase transition of the "random cluster" model, which is a probability distribution on graphs that is closely related to the q-state Potts model.',

The first part presents a large class of new binary quasi-cyclic (QC)-LDPC codes with girth of at least 6 whose parity-check matrices are constructed based on cyclic subgroups of finite fields. Experimental results show that the codes constructed perform well over the binary-input AWGN channel with iterative decoding using the sum-product algorithm (SPA). The second part analyzes the ranks of the parity-check matrices of codes constructed based on finite fields with characteristic of 2 and gives combinatorial expressions for these ranks. The third part identifies a subclass of constructed QC-LDPC codes that have large minimum distances. Decoding of codes in this subclass with the SPA converges very fast.',

	{'abstract': u'The research effort on mobile computing has focused mainly on routing and usually assumes that all mobile devices (MDs) are cooperative. These assumptions hold on military or search and rescue operations, where all hosts are from the same authority and their users have common goals. The application of mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) as open networks has emerged recently but proliferated exponentially. Energy is a valuable commodity in MANETs due to the limited battery of the portable devices. Batteries typically cannot be replaced in MANETs, making their lifetime limited. Diverse users, with unlike goals, share the resources of their devices and ensuring global connectivity comes very low in their priority. This sort of communities can already be found in wired networks, namely on peer-to-peer networks. In this scenario, open MANETs will likely resemble social environments. A group of persons can provide benefits to each of its members as long as everyone provides his contribution. For our particular case, each element of a MANET will be called to forward messages and to participate on routing protocols. A selfish behavior threatens the entire community and also this behavior is infectious as, other MDs may also start to perform in the same way. In the extreme, this can take to the complete sabotage of the network. This paper investigates the prevalent malicious attacks in MANET and analyzes recent selfish trends in MANET. We analyzed the respective strengths and vulnerabilities of the existing selfish behaviour prevention scheme.',

However, the maximum number of channels defined in the current system may cause a potential bottleneck and limit the overall system capacity. The aim of this paper is to compare the impact on system performance of different solutions used to mitigate the impairments due to the radio channel. In particular, taking into account the WiMAX system capacity as well as application delays, the paper presents the simulation results obtained when a static QPSK 1/2 Modulation and Coding Scheme (MCS) is adopted. Then, the study is aimed at evaluating the improvements introduced by the adoption of an adaptive modulation and coding (AMC) and an AMC jointly with Hybrid Automatic Repeat reQuest (HARQ). Results indicate that the best strategy is to use an aggressive AMC table with the HARQ.',

	{'abstract': u"As mobile devices with positioning capabilities continue to proliferate, data management for so-called trajectory databases that capture the historical movements of populations of moving objects becomes important. This paper considers the querying of such databases for convoys, a convoy being a group of objects that have traveled together for some time. More specifically, this paper formalizes the concept of a convoy query using density-based notions, in order to capture groups of arbitrary extents and shapes. Convoy discovery is relevant for real-life applications in throughput planning of trucks and carpooling of vehicles. Although there has been extensive research on trajectories in the literature, none of this can be applied to retrieve correctly exact convoy result sets. Motivated by this, we develop three efficient algorithms for convoy discovery that adopt the well-known filter-refinement framework. In the filter step, we apply line-simplification techniques on the trajectories and establish distance bounds between the simplified trajectories. This permits efficient convoy discovery over the simplified trajectories without missing any actual convoys. In the refinement step, the candidate convoys are further processed to obtain the actual convoys. Our comprehensive empirical study offers insight into the properties of the paper's proposals and demonstrates that the proposals are effective and efficient on real-world trajectory data.",

This paper extends such work by taking into consideration deadlocks. The extended type system verifies that locks are acquired in the proper order. Towards this end we require a language with annotations that specify the locking order. Rather than asking the programmer (or the compiler's backend) to specifically annotate each newly introduced lock, we present an algorithm to infer the annotations.

	{'abstract': u'Wireless sensor networks are conceived to monitor a certain application or physical phenomena and are supposed to function for several years without any human intervention for maintenance. Thus, the main issue in sensor networks is often to extend the lifetime of the network by reducing energy consumption. On the other hand, some applications have high priority traffic that needs to be transferred within a bounded end-to-end delay while maintaining an energy efficient behavior. We propose MaCARI, a time segmentation protocol that saves energy, improves the overall performance of the network and enables quality of service in terms of guaranteed access to the medium and end-to-end delays. This time segmentation is achieved by synchronizing the activity of nodes using a tree-based beacon propagation and allocating activity periods for each cluster of nodes. The tree-based topology is inspired from the cluster-tree proposed by the ZigBee standard. The efficiency of our protocol is proven analytically, by simulation and through real testbed measurements.',

	{'abstract': u'In density estimation task, maximum entropy model (Maxent) can effectively use reliable prior information via certain constraints, i.e., linear constraints without empirical parameters. However, reliable prior information is often insufficient, and the selection of uncertain constraints becomes necessary but poses considerable implementation complexity. Improper setting of uncertain constraints can result in overfitting or underfitting. To solve this problem, a generalization of Maxent, under Tsallis entropy framework, is proposed. The proposed method introduces a convex quadratic constraint for the correction of (expected) Tsallis entropy bias (TEB). Specifically, we demonstrate that the expected Tsallis entropy of sampling distributions is smaller than the Tsallis entropy of the underlying real distribution. This expected entropy reduction is exactly the (expected) TEB, which can be expressed by a closed-form formula and act as a consistent and unbiased correction. TEB indicates that the entropy of a specific sampling distribution should be increased accordingly. This entails a quantitative re-interpretation of the Maxent principle. By compensating TEB and meanwhile forcing the resulting distribution to be close to the sampling distribution, our generalized TEBC Maxent can be expected to alleviate the overfitting and underfitting. We also present a connection between TEB and Lidstone estimator. As a result, TEB-Lidstone estimator is developed by analytically identifying the rate of probability correction in Lidstone. Extensive empirical evaluation shows promising performance of both TEBC Maxent and TEB-Lidstone in comparison with various state-of-the-art density estimation methods.',

Today's high-level language virtual machines (VMs), which are a cornerstone of software development, do not provide sufficient abstraction for concurrency concepts. We analyze concrete and abstract concurrency models and identify the challenges they impose for VMs. To provide sufficient concurrency support in VMs, we propose to integrate concurrency operations into VM instruction sets. Since there will always be VMs optimized for special purposes, our goal is to develop a methodology to design instruction sets with concurrency support. Therefore, we also propose a list of trade-offs that have to be investigated to advise the design of such instruction sets. As a first experiment, we implemented one instruction set extension for shared memory and one for non-shared memory concurrency. From our experimental results, we derived a list of requirements for a full-grown experimental environment for further research.",

	{'abstract': u'Wireless networks equipped with the CSMA protocol are subject to collisions due to interference. For a given interference range we investigate the tradeoff between collisions (hidden nodes) and unused capacity (exposed nodes). We show that the sensing range that maximizes throughput critically depends on the activation rate of nodes. For infinite line networks, we prove the existence of a threshold: When the activation rate is below this threshold the optimal sensing range is small (to maximize spatial reuse). When the activation rate is above the threshold the optimal sensing range is just large enough to preclude all collisions. Simulations suggest that this threshold policy extends to more complex linear and non-linear topologies.',

	{'abstract': u'Many social Web sites allow users to annotate the content with descriptive metadata, such as tags, and more recently to organize content hierarchically. These types of structured metadata provide valuable evidence for learning how a community organizes knowledge. For instance, we can aggregate many personal hierarchies into a common taxonomy, also known as a folksonomy, that will aid users in visualizing and browsing social content, and also to help them in organizing their own content. However, learning from social metadata presents several challenges, since it is sparse, shallow, ambiguous, noisy, and inconsistent. We describe an approach to folksonomy learning based on relational clustering, which exploits structured metadata contained in personal hierarchies. Our approach clusters similar hierarchies using their structure and tag statistics, then incrementally weaves them into a deeper, bushier tree. We study folksonomy learning using social metadata extracted from the photo-sharing site Flickr, and demonstrate that the proposed approach addresses the challenges. Moreover, comparing to previous work, the approach produces larger, more accurate folksonomies, and in addition, scales better.',

	{'abstract': u'A novel channel representation for a two-hop decentralized wireless relay network (DWRN) is proposed, where the relays operate in a completely distributive fashion. The modeling paradigm applies an analogous approach to the description method for a double-directional multipath propagation channel, and takes into account the finite system spatial resolution and the extended relay listening/transmitting time. Specifically, the double-directional information azimuth spectrum (IAS) is formulated to provide a compact representation of information flows in a DWRN. The proposed channel representation is then analyzed from a geometrically-based statistical modeling perspective. Finally, we look into the problem of relay network tomography (RNT), which solves an inverse problem to infer the internal structure of a DWRN by using the instantaneous doubledirectional IAS recorded at multiple measuring nodes exterior to the relay region.',

	{'abstract': u'Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) technology applied with orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) is considered as the ultimate solution to increase channel capacity without any additional spectral resources. At the receiver side, the challenge resides in designing low complexity detection algorithms capable of separating independent streams sent simultaneously from different antennas. In this paper, we introduce an upper-lower bounded-complexity QRD-M algorithm (ULBC QRD-M). In the proposed algorithm we solve the problem of high extreme complexity of the conventional sphere decoding by fixing the upper bound complexity to that of the conventional QRD-M. On the other hand, ULBC QRD-M intelligently cancels all unnecessary hypotheses to achieve very low computational requirements. Analyses and simulation results show that the proposed algorithm achieves the performance of conventional QRD-M with only 26% of the required computations.',

Prior work has focused on TE's formal semantics and its implementation. This paper considers programming idioms, particularly those that vary unexpectedly from the corresponding CML idioms. First, we solve a subtle problem with client-server protocols in TE. Second, we argue that CML's wrap and guard primitives do not translate well to TE, and we suggest useful workarounds.

	{'abstract': u'Multi-access networks may exhibit severe unfairness in throughput. Recent studies show that this unfairness is due to local differences in the neighborhood structure: Nodes with less neighbors receive better access. We study the unfairness in saturated linear networks, and adapt the multi-access CSMA protocol to remove the unfairness completely, by choosing the activation rates of nodes appropriately as a function of the number of neighbors. We then investigate the consequences of this choice of activation rates on the network-average saturated throughput, and we show that these rates perform well in a non-saturated setting.',

	{'abstract': u'This paper develops a novel framework for sharing secret keys using the Automatic Repeat reQuest (ARQ) protocol. We first characterize the underlying information theoretic limits, under different assumptions on the channel spatial and temporal correlation function. Our analysis reveals a novel role of "dumb antennas" in overcoming the negative impact of spatial correlation on the achievable secrecy rates. We further develop an adaptive rate allocation policy, which achieves higher secrecy rates in temporally correlated channels, and explicit constructions for ARQ secrecy coding that enjoy low implementation complexity. Building on this theoretical foundation, we propose a unified framework for ARQ-based secrecy in Wi-Fi networks. By exploiting the existing ARQ mechanism in the IEEE 802.11 standard, we develop security overlays that offer strong security guarantees at the expense of only minor modifications in the medium access layer. Our numerical results establish the achievability of non-zero secrecy rates even when the eavesdropper channel is less noisy, on the average, than the legitimate channel, while our linux-based prototype demonstrates the efficiency of our ARQ overlays in mitigating all known, passive and active, Wi-Fi attacks at the expense of a minimal increase in the link setup time and a small loss in throughput.',

	{'abstract': u'A choreography describes a transaction in which several principals interact. Since choreographies frequently describe business processes affecting substantial assets, we need a security infrastructure in order to implement them safely. As part of a line of work devoted to generating cryptoprotocols from choreographies, we focus here on the execution models suited to the two levels. We give a strand-style semantics for choreographies, and propose a special execution model in which choreography-level messages are faithfully delivered exactly once. We adapt this model to handle multiparty protocols in which some participants may be compromised. At level of cryptoprotocols, we use the standard Dolev-Yao execution model, with one alteration. Since many implementations use a "nonce cache" to discard multiply delivered messages, we provide a semantics for at-most-once delivery.',

	{'abstract': u'The use of agile principles and practices in software development is becoming a powerful force in today\'s workplace. In our quest to develop better products, therefore, it is imperative that we strive to learn and understand the application of Agile methods, principles and techniques to the software development enterprise. Unfortunately, in many educational institutions courses and projects that emphasize Agile Software Development are minimal. At best, students have only limited exposure to the agile philosophy, principles and practices at the graduate and undergraduate levels of education. In an effort to address this concern, we offered a graduate-level course entitled "Agile Software Engineering" in the Department of Computer Science at Virginia Tech in Fall 2009. The primary objectives of the class were to introduce the values, principles and practices underlying the agile philosophy, and to do so in an atmosphere that encourages debate and critical thinking. The course was designed around three central components: (1) teaching the essentials of how one develops a product within an Agile framework, (2) having invited presentation by notable industry experts, and (3) having students present and discuss current research topics and issues. This paper describes our experiences during the offering of that course, and in particular, the unique perspectives of the class instructor, the teaching assistant and a student who was enrolled in the class.',

	{'abstract': u'This paper investigates session programming and typing of benchmark examples to compare productivity, safety and performance with other communications programming languages. Parallel algorithms are used to examine the above aspects due to their extensive use of message passing for interaction, and their increasing prominence in algorithmic research with the rising availability of hardware resources such as multicore machines and clusters. We contribute new benchmark results for SJ, an extension of Java for type-safe, binary session programming, against MPJ Express, a Java messaging system based on the MPI standard. In conclusion, we observe that (1) despite rich libraries and functionality, MPI remains a low-level API, and can suffer from commonly perceived disadvantages of explicit message passing such as deadlocks and unexpected message types, and (2) the benefits of high-level session abstraction, which has significant impact on program structure to improve readability and reliability, and session type-safety can greatly facilitate the task of communications programming whilst retaining competitive performance.',

	{'abstract': u'This paper introduces a novel message-passing (MP) framework for the collaborative filtering (CF) problem associated with recommender systems. We model the movie-rating prediction problem popularized by the Netflix Prize, using a probabilistic factor graph model and study the model by deriving generalization error bounds in terms of the training error. Based on the model, we develop a new MP algorithm, termed IMP, for learning the model. To show superiority of the IMP algorithm, we compare it with the closely related expectation-maximization (EM) based algorithm and a number of other matrix completion algorithms. Our simulation results on Netflix data show that, while the methods perform similarly with large amounts of data, the IMP algorithm is superior for small amounts of data. This improves the cold-start problem of the CF systems in practice. Another advantage of the IMP algorithm is that it can be analyzed using the technique of density evolution (DE) that was originally developed for MP decoding of error-correcting codes.',

	{'abstract': u'In this paper, we propose an adaptive coordinated Tx-Rx beamforming scheme for inter-user interference cancellation, when a base station (BS) communicates with multiple users that each has multiple receive antennas. The conventional coordinated Tx-Rx beamforming scheme transmits a fixed number of data streams for each user regardless of the instantaneous channel states, that is, all the users, no matter they are with ill-conditioned or well-conditioned channels, have the same number of data streams. However, in the proposed adaptive coordinated Tx-Rx beamforming scheme, we adaptively select the number of streams per user to solve the inefficient problem of the conventional coordinated Tx-Rx beamforming scheme. As a result, the BER performance is improved. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the conventional co-ordinated Tx-Rx beamforming algorithm by 2.5dB at a target BER of 10^-2',

	{'abstract': u'We present a unified framework for the declarative analysis of structured communications. By relying on a (timed) concurrent constraint programming language, we show that in addition to the usual operational techniques from process calculi, the analysis of structured communications can elegantly exploit logic-based reasoning techniques. We introduce a declarative interpretation of the language for structured communications proposed by Honda, Vasconcelos, and Kubo. Distinguishing features of our approach are: the possibility of including partial information (constraints) in the session model; the use of explicit time for reasoning about session duration and expiration; a tight correspondence with logic, which formally relates session execution and linear-time temporal logic formulas.',

	{'abstract': u'A graph is a structure composed of a set of vertices (i.e.nodes, dots) connected to one another by a set of edges (i.e.links, lines). The concept of a graph has been around since the late 19 century, however, only in recent decades has there been a strong resurgence in both theoretical and applied graph research in mathematics, physics, and computer science. In applied computing, since the late 1960s, the interlinked table structure of the relational database has been the predominant information storage and retrieval model. With the growth of graph/network-based data and the need to efficiently process such data, new data management systems have been developed. In contrast to the index-intensive, set-theoretic operations of relational databases, graph databases make use of index-free, local traversals. This article discusses the graph traversal pattern and its use in computing.',

	{'abstract': u'Web Operating Systems can be seen as an extension of traditional Operating Systems where the addresses used to manage files and execute programs (via the basic load/execution mechanism) are extended from local filesystem path-names to URLs. A first consequence is that, similarly as in traditional web technologies, executing a program at a given URL, can be done in two modalities: either the execution is performed client-side at the invoking machine (and relative URL addressing in the executed program set to refer to the invoked URL) or it is performed server-side at the machine addressed by the invoked URL (as, e.g., for a web service). Moreover in this context, user identification for access to programs and files and workflow-based composition of service programs is naturally based on token/session-like mechanisms. We propose a middleware based on client-server protocols and on a set primitives, for managing files/resources and executing programs (in the form of client-side/server-side components/services) in Web Operating Systems. We formally define the semantics of such middleware via a process algebraic approach.',

	{'abstract': u'We consider the problem of fault-tolerance in nanoscale algorithmic self-assembly. We employ a variant of Winfree\'s abstract Tile Assembly Model (aTAM), the two-handed aTAM, in which square "tiles" -- a model of molecules constructed from DNA for the purpose of engineering self-assembled nanostructures -- aggregate according to specific binding sites of varying strengths, and in which large aggregations of tiles may attach to each other, in contrast to the seeded aTAM, in which tiles aggregate one at a time to a single specially-designated "seed" assembly. We focus on a major cause of errors in tile-based self-assembly: that of unintended growth due to "weak" strength-1 bonds, which if allowed to persist, may be stabilized by subsequent attachment of neighboring tiles in the sense that at least energy 2 is now required to break apart the resulting assembly; i.e., the errant assembly is stable at temperature 2. We study a common self-assembly benchmark problem, that of assembling an n x n square using O(log n) unique tile types, under the two-handed model of self-assembly. Our main result achieves a much stronger notion of fault-tolerance than those achieved previously. Arbitrary strength-1 growth is allowed (i.e., the temperature is "fuzzy" and may drift from 2 to 1 for arbitrarily long); however, any assembly that grows sufficiently to become stable at temperature 2 is guaranteed to assemble at temperature 2 into the correct final assembly of an n x n square. In other words, errors due to insufficient attachment, which is the cause of errors studied in earlier papers on fault-tolerance, are prevented absolutely in our main construction, rather than only with high probability and for sufficiently small structures, as in previous fault-tolerance studies.',

	{'abstract': u"An accurate motion model is an important component in modern-day robotic systems, but building such a model for a complex system often requires an appreciable amount of manual effort. In this paper we present a motion model representation, the Dynamic Gaussian Mixture Model (DGMM), that alleviates the need to manually design the form of a motion model, and provides a direct means of incorporating auxiliary sensory data into the model. This representation and its accompanying algorithms are validated experimentally using an 8-legged kinematically complex robot, as well as a standard benchmark dataset. The presented method not only learns the robot's motion model, but also improves the model's accuracy by incorporating information about the terrain surrounding the robot.",

	{'abstract': u'Partition functions of certain classes of "spin glass" models in statistical physics show strong connections to combinatorial graph invariants. Also known as homomorphism functions they allow for the representation of many such invariants, for example, the number of independent sets of a graph or the number nowhere zero k-flows. Contributing to recent developments on the complexity of partition functions we study the complexity of partition functions with complex values. These functions are usually determined by a square matrix A and it was shown by Goldberg, Grohe, Jerrum, and Thurley that for each real-valued symmetric matrix, the corresponding partition function is either polynomial time computable or #P-hard. Extending this result, we give a complete description of the complexity of partition functions definable by Hermitian matrices. These can also be classified into polynomial time computable and #P-hard ones. Although the criterion for polynomial time computability is not describable in a single line, we give a clear account of it in terms of structures associated with Abelian groups.',

	{'abstract': u"We develop, analyze and experiment with a new tool, called MADMX, which extracts frequent motifs, possibly including don't care characters, from biological sequences. We introduce density, a simple and flexible measure for bounding the number of don't cares in a motif, defined as the ratio of solid (i.e., different from don't care) characters to the total length of the motif. By extracting only maximal dense motifs, MADMX reduces the output size and improves performance, while enhancing the quality of the discoveries. The efficiency of our approach relies on a newly defined combining operation, dubbed fusion, which allows for the construction of maximal dense motifs in a bottom-up fashion, while avoiding the generation of nonmaximal ones. We provide experimental evidence of the efficiency and the quality of the motifs returned by MADMX",

	{'abstract': u'The classical technique for proving termination of a generic sequential computer program involves the synthesis of a ranking function for each loop of the program. Linear ranking functions are particularly interesting because many terminating loops admit one and algorithms exist to automatically synthesize it. In this paper we present two such algorithms: one based on work dated 1991 by Sohn and Van Gelder; the other, due to Podelski and Rybalchenko, dated 2004. Remarkably, while the two algorithms will synthesize a linear ranking function under exactly the same set of conditions, the former is mostly unknown to the community of termination analysis and its general applicability has never been put forward before the present paper. In this paper we thoroughly justify both algorithms, we prove their correctness, we compare their worst-case complexity and experimentally evaluate their efficiency, and we present an open-source implementation of them that will make it very easy to include termination-analysis capabilities in automatic program verifiers.',

	{'abstract': u"In secure multi-party computation parties jointly evaluate an -variate function in the presence of an adversary which can corrupt up till parties. Almost all the works that have appeared in the literature so far assume the presence of authenticated channels between the parties. This assumption is far from realistic. Two directions of research have been borne from relaxing this (strong) assumption: (a) The adversary is virtually omnipotent and can control all the communication channels in the network, (b) Only a partially connected topology of authenticated channels is guaranteed and adversary controls a subset of the communication channels in the network. This work introduces a new setting for (unconditional) secure multiparty computation problem which is an interesting intermediate model with respect to the above well studied models from the literature (by sharing a salient feature from both the above models). We consider the problem of (unconditional) secure multi-party computation when 'some' of the communication channels connecting the parties can be corrupted passively as well as actively. For this setting, some honest parties may be connected to several other honest parties via corrupted channels and may not be able to authentically communicate with them. Such parties may not be assured the canonical guarantees of correctness or privacy. We present refined definitions of security for this new intermediate model of unconditional multiparty computation. We show how to adapt protocols for (Unconditional) secure multiparty computation to realize the definitions and also argue the tightness of the results achieved by us.",

	{'abstract': u"Online social networking has quickly become one of the most common activities of Internet users. As social networks evolve, they encourage users to share more information, requiring the users, in turn, to place more trust into social networks. Peer-to-peer (P2P) overlays provide an environment that can return ownership of information, trust, and control to the users, away from centralized third-party social networks. In this paper, we present a novel concept, social profile overlays, which enable users to share their profile only with trusted peers in a scalable, reliable, and private manner. Each user's profile consists of a unique private, secure overlay, where members of that overlay have a friendship with the overlay owner. Profile data is made available without regard to the online state of the profile owner through the use of the profile overlay's distributed data store. Privacy and security are enforced through the use of a public key infrastructure (PKI), where the role of certificate authority (CA) is handled by the overlay owner and each member of the overlay has a CA-signed certificate. All members of the social network join a common public or directory overlay facilitating friend discovery and bootstrap connections into profile overlays. We define interfaces and present tools that can be used to implement this system, as well as explore some of the challenges related to it.",

	{'abstract': u'We consider Mobile Ad-hoc Network (MANET) with transmitters located according to a Poisson point in the Euclidean plane, slotted Aloha Medium Access (MAC) protocol and the so-called outage scenario, where a successful transmission requires a Signal-to-Interference-and-Noise (SINR) larger than some threshold. We analyze the local delays in such a network, namely the number of times slots required for nodes to transmit a packet to their prescribed next-hop receivers. The analysis depends very much on the receiver scenario and on the variability of the fading. In most cases, each node has finite-mean geometric random delay and thus a positive next hop throughput. However, the spatial (or large population) averaging of these individual finite mean-delays leads to infinite values in several practical cases, including the Rayleigh fading and positive thermal noise case. In some cases it exhibits an interesting phase transition phenomenon where the spatial average is finite when certain model parameters are below a threshold and infinite above. We call this phenomenon, contention phase transition. We argue that the spatial average of the mean local delays is infinite primarily because of the outage logic, where one transmits full packets at time slots when the receiver is covered at the required SINR and where one wastes all the other time slots. This results in the "RESTART" mechanism, which in turn explains why we have infinite spatial average. Adaptive coding offers a nice way of breaking the outage/RESTART logic. We show examples where the average delays are finite in the adaptive coding case, whereas they are infinite in the outage case.',

	{'abstract': u"This paper presents a set of exploits an adversary can use to continuously spy on most BitTorrent users of the Internet from a single machine and for a long period of time. Using these exploits for a period of 103 days, we collected 148 million IPs downloading 2 billion copies of contents. We identify the IP address of the content providers for 70% of the BitTorrent contents we spied on. We show that a few content providers inject most contents into BitTorrent and that those content providers are located in foreign data centers. We also show that an adversary can compromise the privacy of any peer in BitTorrent and identify the big downloaders that we define as the peers who subscribe to a large number of contents. This infringement on users' privacy poses a significant impediment to the legal adoption of BitTorrent.",

	{'abstract': u"The enforcement of access control policies using cryptography has received considerable attention in recent years and the security of such enforcement schemes is increasingly well understood. Recent work in the area has considered the efficient enforcement of temporal and geo-spatial access control policies, and asymptotic results for the time and space complexity of efficient enforcement schemes have been obtained. However, for practical purposes, it is useful to have explicit bounds for the complexity of enforcement schemes. In this paper, we consider interval-based access control policies, of which temporal and geo-spatial access control policies are special cases. We define enforcement schemes for interval-based access control policies for which it is possible, in almost all cases, to obtain exact values for the schemes' complexity, thereby subsuming a substantial body of work in the literature. Moreover, our enforcement schemes are more practical than existing schemes, in the sense that they operate in the same way as standard cryptographic enforcement schemes, unlike other efficient schemes in the literature. The main difference between our approach and earlier work is that we develop techniques that are specific to the cryptographic enforcement of interval-based access control policies, rather than applying generic techniques that give rise to complex constructions and asymptotic bounds.",

	{'abstract': u'In this paper, cognitive transmission under quality of service (QoS) constraints is studied. In the cognitive radio channel model, it is assumed that both the secondary receiver and the secondary transmitter know the channel fading coefficients perfectly and optimize the power adaptation policy under given constraints, depending on the channel activity of the primary users, which is determined by channel sensing performed by the secondary users. The transmission rates are equal to the instantaneous channel capacity values. A state transition model with four states is constructed to model this cognitive transmission channel. Statistical limitations on the buffer lengths are imposed to take into account the QoS constraints. The maximum throughput under these statistical QoS constraints is identified by finding the effective capacity of the cognitive radio channel. The impact upon the effective capacity of several system parameters, including the channel sensing duration, detection threshold, detection and false alarm probabilities, and QoS parameters, is investigated.',

	{'abstract': u'Base station cooperative transmission, which is also known as coordinated multi-point (CoMP) transmission, is a promising technique to improve spectrum efficiency in future cellular systems. However, they need large signalling overhead to gather the channel information. In this paper, we consider low feedback user scheduling in downlink coherent CoMP systems exploiting their inherent channel asymmetry. Through the analysis of the statistics of the angle between channel vectors and the tightness of a lower bound of the orthogonally projected norm, we show that channel norm provides sufficient information to judge the orthogonality among users in asymmetric channels. Based on this observation, we propose a channel norm-based user scheduler (NUS), a local channel aided NUS (LocalNUS) and a large-scale fading-based user scheduler (LUS). Simulation results show that the LocalNUS performs very close to the existing greedy user scheduler (GUS) and semi-orthogonal user scheduler (SUS) with full channel state information but requiring much lower feedback overhead, the NUS performs close to or even outperforms the GUS and the SUS when limited feedback is considered, and the LUS is robust to time-varying channels.',

It is shown that Arkan's polarization technique applied individually to each user transforms independent uses of a -user binary input MAC into successive uses of extremal MACs. This transformation has a number of desirable properties: (i) the `uniform sum rate' of the original MAC is preserved, (ii) the extremal MACs have uniform rate regions that are not only polymatroids but matroids and thus (iii) their uniform sum rate can be reached by each user transmitting either uncoded or fixed bits; in this sense they are easy to communicate over. A polar code can then be constructed with an encoding and decoding complexity of (where is the block length), a block error probability of , and capable of achieving the uniform sum rate of any binary input MAC with arbitrary many users. An application of this polar code construction to communicating on the AWGN channel is also discussed.",

	{'abstract': u'Backpressure-based adaptive routing algorithms where each packet is routed along a possibly different path have been extensively studied in the literature. However, such algorithms typically result in poor delay performance and involve high implementation complexity. In this paper, we develop a new adaptive routing algorithm built upon the widely-studied back-pressure algorithm. We decouple the routing and scheduling components of the algorithm by designing a probabilistic routing table which is used to route packets to per-destination queues. The scheduling decisions in the case of wireless networks are made using counters called shadow queues. The results are also extended to the case of networks which employ simple forms of network coding. In that case, our algorithm provides a low-complexity solution to optimally exploit the routing-coding tradeoff.',

	{'abstract': u"Maximum mutual information (MMI) is a model selection criterion used for hidden Markov model (HMM) parameter estimation that was developed more than twenty years ago as a discriminative alternative to the maximum likelihood criterion for HMM-based speech recognition. It has been shown in the speech recognition literature that parameter estimation using the current MMI paradigm, lattice-based MMI, consistently outperforms maximum likelihood estimation, but this is at the expense of undesirable convergence properties. In particular, recognition performance is sensitive to the number of times that the iterative MMI estimation algorithm, extended Baum-Welch, is performed. In fact, too many iterations of extended Baum-Welch will lead to degraded performance, despite the fact that the MMI criterion improves at each iteration. This phenomenon is at variance with the analogous behavior of maximum likelihood estimation -- at least for the HMMs used in speech recognition -- and it has previously been attributed to `over fitting'. In this paper, we present an analysis of lattice-based MMI that demonstrates, first of all, that the asymptotic behavior of lattice-based MMI is much worse than was previously understood, i.e. it does not appear to converge at all, and, second of all, that this is not due to `over fitting'. Instead, we demonstrate that the `over fitting' phenomenon is the result of standard methodology that exacerbates the poor behavior of two key approximations in the lattice-based MMI machinery. We also demonstrate that if we modify the standard methodology to improve the validity of these approximations, then the convergence properties of lattice-based MMI become benign without sacrificing improvements to recognition accuracy.",

	{'abstract': u"Behavior Driven Development (NORTH, 2006) is a specification technique that is growing in acceptance in the Agile methods communities. BDD allows to securely verify that all functional requirements were treated properly by source code, by connecting the textual description of these requirements to tests. On the other side, the Enterprise Information Systems (EIS) researchers and practitioners defends the use of Business Process Modeling (BPM) to, before defining any part of the system, perform the modeling of the system's underlying business process. Therefore, it can be stated that, in the case of EIS, functional requirements are obtained by identifying Use Cases from the business process models. The aim of this paper is, in a narrower perspective, to propose the use of Finite State Machines (FSM) to model business process and then connect them to the BDD machinery, thus driving better quality for EIS. In a broader perspective, this article aims to provoke a discussion on the mapping of the various BPM notations, since there isn't a real standard for business process modeling (Moller et al., 2007), to BDD. Firstly a historical perspective of the evolution of previous proposals from which this one emerged will be presented, and then the reasons to change from Model Driven Development (MDD) to BDD will be presented also in a historical perspective. Finally the proposal of using FSM, specifically by using UML Statechart diagrams, will be presented, followed by some conclusions.",

	{'abstract': u'In this paper, we have studied the energy efficiency of cooperative networks operating in either the fixed Amplifyand- Forward (AF) or the selective Decode-and-Forward (DF) mode. We consider the optimization of the M-ary quadrature amplitude modulation (MQAM) constellation size to minimize the bit energy consumption under given bit error rate (BER) constraints. In the computation of the energy expenditure, the circuit, transmission, and retransmission energies are taken into account. The link reliabilities and retransmission probabilities are determined through the outage probabilities under the Rayleigh fading assumption. Several interesting observations with practical implications are made. It is seen that while large constellations are preferred at small transmission distances, constellation size should be decreased as the distance increases; the cooperative gain is computed to compare direct transmission and cooperative transmission.',

	{'abstract': u'This paper proposes a type of pseudorandom number generator, Mersenne Twister for Graphic Processor (MTGP), for efficient generation on graphic processessing units (GPUs). MTGP supports large state sizes such as 11213 bits, and uses the high parallelism of GPUs in computing many steps of the recursion in parallel. The second proposal is a parameter-set generator for MTGP, named MTGP Dynamic Creator (MTGPDC). MT- GPDC creates up to 2^32 distinct parameter sets which generate sequences with high-dimensional uniformity. This facility is suitable for a large grid of GPUs where each GPU requires separate random number streams. MTGP is based on linear recursion over the two-element field, and has better high-dimensional equidistribution than the Mersenne Twister pseudorandom number generator.',

	{'abstract': u'Structured and semi-structured data describing entities, taxonomies and ontologies appears in many domains. There is a huge interest in integrating structured information from multiple sources; however integrating structured data to infer complex common structures is a difficult task because the integration must aggregate similar structures while avoiding structural inconsistencies that may appear when the data is combined. In this work, we study the integration of structured social metadata: shallow personal hierarchies specified by many individual users on the SocialWeb, and focus on inferring a collection of integrated, consistent taxonomies. We frame this task as an optimization problem with structural constraints. We propose a new inference algorithm, which we refer to as Relational Affinity Propagation (RAP) that extends affinity propagation (Frey and Dueck 2007) by introducing structural constraints. We validate the approach on a real-world social media dataset, collected from the photosharing website Flickr. Our empirical results show that our proposed approach is able to construct deeper and denser structures compared to an approach using only the standard affinity propagation algorithm.',

	{'abstract': u'We present a lattice algorithm specifically designed for some classical applications of lattice reduction. The applications are for lattice bases with a generalized knapsack-type structure, where the target vectors are boundably short. For such applications, the complexity of the algorithm improves traditional lattice reduction by replacing some dependence on the bit-length of the input vectors by some dependence on the bound for the output vectors. If the bit-length of the target vectors is unrelated to the bit-length of the input, then our algorithm is only linear in the bit-length of the input entries, which is an improvement over the quadratic complexity floating-point LLL algorithms. To illustrate the usefulness of this algorithm we show that a direct application to factoring univariate polynomials over the integers leads to the first complexity bound improvement since 1984. A second application is algebraic number reconstruction, where a new complexity bound is obtained as well.',

	{'abstract': u'In this paper, the secure transmission of information over an ergodic fading channel is investigated in the presence of statistical quality of service (QoS) constraints. We employ effective capacity, which provides the maximum constant arrival rate that a given process can support while satisfying statistical delay constraints, to measure the secure throughput of the system, i.e., effective secure throughput. We assume that the channel side information (CSI) of the main channel is available at the transmitter side. Depending on the availability of the CSI of the eavesdropper channel, we obtain the corresponding optimal power control policies that maximize the effective secure throughput. In particular, when the CSI of the eavesdropper channel is available at the transmitter, the transmitter can no longer wait for transmission when the main channel is much better than the eavesdropper channel due to the introduction of QoS constraints. Moreover, the CSI of the eavesdropper channel becomes useless as QoS constraints become stringent.',

	{'abstract': u'The QR Decomposition (QRD) of communication channel matrices is a fundamental prerequisite to several detection schemes in Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) communication systems. Herein, the main feature of the QRD is to transform the non-causal system into a causal system, where consequently efficient detection algorithms based on the Successive Interference Cancellation (SIC) or Sphere Decoder (SD) become possible. Also, QRD can be used as a light but efficient antenna selection scheme. In this paper, we address the study of the QRD methods and compare their efficiency in terms of computational complexity and error rate performance. Moreover, a particular attention is paid to the parallelism of the QRD algorithms since it reduces the latency of the matrix factorization.',

Our algorithms work in a semi-online setting where all the inputs are known in advance and outcomes are unknown and given step by step. We apply the Aggregating Algorithm to construct a prediction method whose cumulative loss over all the input vectors is comparable with the cumulative loss of any linear functional on the Banach lattice. As a by-product we get an algorithm that takes signals from an arbitrary domain. Its cumulative loss is comparable with the cumulative loss of any predictor function from Besov and Triebel-Lizorkin spaces. We describe several applications of our setting.',

	{'abstract': u"Who are the influential people in an online social network? The answer to this question depends not only on the structure of the network, but also on details of the dynamic processes occurring on it. We classify these processes as conservative and non-conservative. A random walk on a network is an example of a conservative dynamic process, while information spread is non-conservative. The influence models used to rank network nodes can be similarly classified, depending on the dynamic process they implicitly emulate. We claim that in order to correctly rank network nodes, the influence model has to match the details of the dynamic process. We study a real-world network on the social news aggregator Digg, which allows users to post and vote for news stories. We empirically define influence as the number of in-network votes a user's post generates. This influence measure, and the resulting ranking, arises entirely from the dynamics of voting on Digg, which represents non-conservative information flow. We then compare predictions of different influence models with this empirical estimate of influence. The results show that non-conservative models are better able to predict influential users on Digg. We find that normalized alpha-centrality metric turns out to be one of the best predictors of influence. We also present a simple algorithm for computing this metric and the associated mathematical formulation and analytical proofs.",

	{'abstract': u'The purpose of this paper is to show how existing scientific software can be parallelized using a separate thin layer of Python code where all parallel communication is implemented. We provide specific examples on such layers of code, and these examples may act as templates for parallelizing a wide set of serial scientific codes. The use of Python for parallelization is motivated by the fact that the language is well suited for reusing existing serial codes programmed in other languages. The extreme flexibility of Python with regard to handling functions makes it very easy to wrap up decomposed computational tasks of a serial scientific application as Python functions. Many parallelization-specific components can be implemented as generic Python functions, which may take as input those functions that perform concrete computational tasks. The overall programming effort needed by this parallelization approach is rather limited, and the resulting parallel Python scripts have a compact and clean structure. The usefulness of the parallelization approach is exemplified by three different classes of applications in natural and social sciences.',

	{'abstract': u'Micro-blogging services such as Twitter allow anyone to publish anything, anytime. Needless to say, many of the available contents can be diminished as babble or spam. However, given the number and diversity of users, some valuable pieces of information should arise from the stream of tweets. Thus, such services can develop into valuable sources of up-to-date information (the so-called real-time web) provided a way to find the most relevant/trustworthy/authoritative users is available. Hence, this makes a highly pertinent question for which graph centrality methods can provide an answer. In this paper the author offers a comprehensive survey of feasible algorithms for ranking users in social networks, he examines their vulnerabilities to linking malpractice in such networks, and suggests an objective criterion against which to compare such algorithms. Additionally, he suggests a first step towards "desensitizing" prestige algorithms against cheating by spammers and other abusive users.',

	{'abstract': u'In recent years computer systems have become increasingly complex and consequently the challenge of protecting these systems has become increasingly difficult. Various techniques have been implemented to counteract the misuse of computer systems in the form of firewalls, anti-virus software and intrusion detection systems. The complexity of networks and dynamic nature of computer systems leaves current methods with significant room for improvement. Computer scientists have recently drawn inspiration from mechanisms found in biological systems and, in the context of computer security, have focused on the human immune system (HIS). The human immune system provides a high level of protection from constant attacks. By examining the precise mechanisms of the human immune system, it is hoped the paradigm will improve the performance of real intrusion detection systems. This paper presents an introduction to recent developments in the field of immunology. It discusses the incorporation of a novel immunological paradigm, Danger Theory, and how this concept is inspiring artificial immune systems (AIS). Applications within the context of computer security are outlined drawing direct reference to the underlying principles of Danger Theory and finally, the current state of intrusion detection systems is discussed and improvements suggested.',

	{'abstract': u'We explore the intricate interdependent relationship among counting problems, considered from three frameworks for such problems: Holant Problems, counting CSP and weighted H-colorings. We consider these problems for general complex valued functions that take boolean inputs. We show that results from one framework can be used to derive results in another, and this happens in both directions. Holographic reductions discover an underlying unity, which is only revealed when these counting problems are investigated in the complex domain . We prove three complexity dichotomy theorems, leading to a general theorem for Holant problems. This is the natural class of Holant problems where one can assign constants 0 or 1. More specifically, given any signature grid on over a set of symmetric functions, we completely classify the complexity to be in P or #P-hard, according to , of [ sum_ prod_ f_v( sigma mid_), ] where (, are the unary constant 0, 1 functions). Not only is holographic reduction the main tool, but also the final dichotomy can be only naturally stated in the language of holographic transformations. The proof goes through another dichotomy theorem on boolean complex weighted #CSP.',

We come up with a simple modification of the deterministic algorithm, achieving a running time of (d(k-1)/k * k^d/(k^d-1))^n poly(n).

	{'abstract': u'A source model for secret key generation between terminals is considered. Two users, namely users 1 and 2, at one side communicate with another user, namely user 3, at the other side via a public channel where three users can observe i.i.d. outputs of correlated sources. Each of users 1 and 2 intends to share a secret key with user 3 where user 1 acts as a wiretapper for user 2 and vice versa. In this model, two situations are considered: communication from users 1 and 2 to user 3 (the forward key strategy) and from user 3 to users 1 and 2 (the backward key strategy). In both situations, the goal is sharing a secret key between user 1 and user 3 while leaking no effective information about that key to user 2, and simultaneously, sharing another secret key between user 2 and user 3 while leaking no effective information about the latter key to user 1. This model is motivated by wireless communications when considering user 3 as a base station and users 1 and 2 as network users. In this paper, for both the forward and backward key strategies, inner and outer bounds of secret key capacity regions are derived. In special situations where one of users 1 and 2 is only interested in wiretapping and not key sharing, our results agree with that of Ahlswede and Csiszar. Also, we investigate some special cases in which the inner bound coincides with the outer bound and secret key capacity region is deduced.',

	{'abstract': u"Analog (uncoded) transmission provides a simple and robust scheme for communicating a Gaussian source over a Gaussian channel under the mean squared error (MSE) distortion measure. Unfortunately, its performance is usually inferior to the all-digital, separation-based source-channel coding solution, which requires exact knowledge of the channel at the encoder. The loss comes from the fact that except for very special cases, e.g. white source and channel of matching bandwidth (BW), it is impossible to achieve perfect matching of source to channel and channel to source by linear means. We show that by combining prediction and modulo-lattice operations, it is possible to match any colored Gaussian source to any colored Gaussian noise channel (of possibly different BW), hence achieve Shannon's optimum attainable performance . Furthermore, when the source and channel BWs are equal (but otherwise their spectra are arbitrary), this scheme is asymptotically robust in the sense that for high signal-to-noise ratio a single encoder (independent of the noise variance) achieves the optimum performance. The derivation is based upon a recent modulo-lattice modulation scheme for transmitting a Wyner-Ziv source over a dirty-paper channel.",

	{'abstract': u'We propose a method for automatically generating abstract transformers for static analysis by abstract interpretation. The method focuses on linear constraints on programs operating on rational, real or floating-point variables and containing linear assignments and tests. Given the specification of an abstract domain, and a program block, our method automatically outputs an implementation of the corresponding abstract transformer. It is thus a form of program transformation. In addition to loop-free code, the same method also applies for obtaining least fixed points as functions of the precondition, which permits the analysis of loops and recursive functions. The motivation of our work is data-flow synchronous programming languages, used for building control-command embedded systems, but it also applies to imperative and functional programming. Our algorithms are based on quantifier elimination and symbolic manipulation techniques over linear arithmetic formulas. We also give less general results for nonlinear constraints and nonlinear program constructs.',

	{'abstract': u'The draft paper defines a system, which is capable of maintaining bases of test cases for logical specifications. The specifications, which are subject to this system are transformed from their original shape in first-order logic to form-based expressions as originally introduced in logics of George Spencer-Brown. The innovation comes from the operations the system provides when injecting faults - so-called mutations - to the specifications. The system presented here applies to logical specifications from areas as different as programming, ontologies or hardware specifications.',

	{'abstract': u'Distributed storage systems are mainly justified due to the limited amount of storage capacity and improving the reliability through distributing data over multiple storage nodes. On the other hand, it may happen the data is stored in unreliable nodes, while it is desired the end user to have a reliable access to the stored data. So, in an event that a node is damaged, to prevent the system reliability to regress, it is necessary to regenerate a new node with the same amount of stored data as the damaged node to retain the number of storage nodes, thereby having the previous reliability. This requires the new node to connect to some of existing nodes and downloads the required information, thereby occupying some bandwidth, called the repair bandwidth. On the other hand, it is more likely the cost of downloading varies across different nodes. This paper aims at investigating the theoretical cost-bandwidth tradeoff, and more importantly, it is demonstrated that any point on this curve can be achieved through the use of the so called generalized regenerating codes which is an enhancement of the regeneration codes introduced by Dimakis et al. in [1].',

	{'abstract': u'This paper analyzes the asymptotic exponent of both the weight spectrum and the stopping set size spectrum for a class of generalized low-density parity-check (GLDPC) codes. Specifically, all variable nodes (VNs) are assumed to have the same degree (regular VN set), while the check node (CN) set is assumed to be composed of a mixture of different linear block codes (hybrid CN set). A simple expression for the exponent (which is also referred to as the growth rate or the spectral shape) is developed. This expression is consistent with previous results, including the case where the normalized weight or stopping set size tends to zero. Furthermore, it is shown how certain symmetry properties of the local weight distribution at the CNs induce a symmetry in the overall weight spectral shape function.',

	{'abstract': u'The IEEE 802.11 standard offers a cheap and promising solution for small scale wireless networks. Due to the self configuring nature, WLANs do not require large scale infrastructure deployment, and are scalable and easily maintainable which incited its popularity in both literature and industry. In real environment, these networks operate mostly under unsaturated condition. We investigate performance of such a network with m-retry limit BEB based DCF. We consider imperfect channel with provision for power capture. Our method employs a Markov model and represents the most common performance measures in terms of network parameters making the model and mathematical analysis useful in network design and planning. We also explore the effects of packet error, network size, initial contention window, and retry limit on overall performance of WLANs.',

	{'abstract': u'We consider the indirect covering subtree problem (Kim et al., 1996). The input is an edge weighted tree graph along with customers located at the nodes. Each customer is associated with a radius and a penalty. The goal is to locate a tree-shaped facility such that the sum of setup and penalty cost is minimized. The setup cost equals the sum of edge lengths taken by the facility and the penalty cost is the sum of penalties of all customers whose distance to the facility exceeds their radius. The indirect covering subtree problem generalizes the single maximum coverage location problem on trees where the facility is a node rather than a subtree. Indirect covering subtree can be solved in time (Kim et al., 1996). A slightly faster algorithm for single maximum coverage location with a running time of has been provided (Spoerhase and Wirth, 2009). We achieve time for indirect covering subtree thereby providing the fastest known algorithm for both problems. Our result implies also faster algorithms for competitive location problems such as -medianoid and -centroid on trees. We complement our result by a lower bound of for single maximum coverage location and -medianoid on a real-number RAM model showing that our algorithm is optimal in running time.',

	{'abstract': u"Multi-agent systems where the agents are developed by parties with competing interests, and where there is no access to an agent's internal state, are often classified as `open'. The member agents of such systems may inadvertently fail to, or even deliberately choose not to, conform to the system specification. Consequently, it is necessary to specify the normative relations that may exist between the agents, such as permission, obligation, and institutional power. The specification of open agent systems of this sort is largely seen as a design-time activity. Moreover, there is no support for run-time specification modification. Due to environmental, social, or other conditions, however, it is often required to revise the specification during the system execution. To address this requirement, we present an infrastructure for `dynamic' specifications, that is, specifications that may be modified at run-time by the agents. The infrastructure consists of well-defined procedures for proposing a modification of the `rules of the game', as well as decision-making over and enactment of proposed modifications. We evaluate proposals for rule modification by modelling a dynamic specification as a metric space, and by considering the effects of accepting a proposal on system utility. Furthermore, we constrain the enactment of proposals that do not meet the evaluation criteria. We employ the action language C+ to formalise dynamic specifications, and the `Causal Calculator' implementation of C+ to execute the specifications. We illustrate our infrastructure by presenting a dynamic specification of a resource-sharing protocol.",

	{'abstract': u'This paper proposes to address new requirements of confidentiality, integrity and availability properties fitting to peer-to-peer domains of resources. The enforcement of security properties in an open peer-topeer network remains an open problem as the literature have mainly proposed contribution on availability of resources and anonymity of users. That paper proposes a novel architecture that eases the administration of a peer-to-peer network. It considers a network of safe peer-to-peer clients in the sense that it is a commune client software that is shared by all the participants to cope with the sharing of various resources associated with different security requirements. However, our proposal deals with possible malicious peers that attempt to compromise the requested security properties. Despite the safety of an open peer-to-peer network cannot be formally guaranteed, since a end user has privileges on the target host, our solution provides several advanced security enforcement. First, it enables to formally define the requested security properties of the various shared resources. Second, it evaluates the trust and the reputation of the requesting peer by sending challenges that test the fairness of its peer-to-peer security policy. Moreover, it proposes an advanced Mandatory Access Control that enforces the required peer-to-peer security properties through an automatic projection of the requested properties onto SELinux policies. Thus, the SELinux system of the requesting peer is automatically configured with respect to the required peer-to-peer security properties.',

	{'abstract': u"A novel language system has given rise to promising alternatives to standard formal and processor network models of computation. An interstring linked with a abstract machine environment, shares sub-expressions, transfers data, and spatially allocates resources for the parallel evaluation of dataflow. Formal models called the a-Ram family are introduced, designed to support interstring programming languages (interlanguages). Distinct from dataflow, graph rewriting, and FPGA models, a-Ram instructions are bit level and execute in situ. They support sequential and parallel languages without the space/time overheads associated with the Turing Machine and lambda-calculus, enabling massive programs to be simulated. The devices of one a-Ram model, called the Synchronic A-Ram, are fully connected and simpler than FPGA LUT's. A compiler for an interlanguage called Space, has been developed for the Synchronic A-Ram. Space is MIMD. strictly typed, and deterministic. Barring memory allocation and compilation, modules are referentially transparent. At a high level of abstraction, modules exhibit a state transition system, aiding verification. Data structures and parallel iteration are straightforward to implement, and allocations of sub-processes and data transfers to resources are implicit. Space points towards highly connected architectures called Synchronic Engines, that are more general purpose than systolic arrays and GPUs, and bypass programmability and conflict issues associated with multicores.",

	{'abstract': u"Mobile ip (mip) is an internet protocol that allows mobile nodes to have continuous network connectivity to the internet without changing their ip addresses while moving to other networks. The packets sent from correspondent node (cn) to a mobile node (mn) go first through the mobile node's home agent (ha), then the ha tunnels them to the mn's foreign network. One of the main problems in the original mip is the triangle routing problem. Triangle routing problem appears when the indirect path between cn and mn through the ha is longer than the direct path. This paper proposes a new technique to improve the performance of the original mip during the handoff. The proposed technique reduces the delay, the packet loss and the registration time for all the packets transferred between the cn and the mn. In this technique, tunneling occurs at two levels above the ha in a hierarchical network. To show the effectiveness of the proposed technique, it is compared with the original mip and another technique for solving the same problem in which tunneling occurs at one level above the ha. Simulation results presented in this paper are based on the ns2 mobility software on linux platform. The simulations results show that our proposed technique achieves better performance than the others, considering the packet delay, the packet losses during handoffs and the registration time, in different scenarios for the location of the mn with respect to the ha and fas.",

	{'abstract': u'The market economy deals with many interacting agents such as buyers and sellers who are autonomous intelligent agents pursuing their own interests. One such multi-agent system (MAS) that plays an important role in auctions is the combinatorial auctioning system (CAS). We use this framework to define our concept of fairness in terms of what we call as "basic fairness" and "extended fairness". The assumptions of quasilinear preferences and dominant strategies are taken into consideration while explaining fairness. We give an algorithm to ensure fairness in a CAS using a Generalized Vickrey Auction (GVA). We use an algorithm of Sandholm to achieve optimality. Basic and extended fairness are then analyzed according to the dominant strategy solution concept.',

	{'abstract': u'This paper presents a performance evaluation of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) based on Impulse Radio Ultra Wideband (IR-UWB) over a new simulation platform developed for this purpose. The simulation platform is built on an existing network simulator: Global Mobile Information System Simulator (GloMoSim). It mainly focuses on the accurately modeling of IR-UWB PHYsical (PHY) and Medium Access Control (MAC) layer. Pulse collision is modeled according to the used time hopping sequence (THS) and the pulse propagation delay in order to increase the simulation fidelity. It also includes a detection and identification application based on a new sensing channel and new sensor device models. The proposed architecture is generic so it can be reused for any simulation platform. The performance evaluation is based on one of the typical WSN applications: local area protection, where sensor nodes are densely scattered in an access regulated area in order to detect, identify and report non authorized accesses to a base station for analysis. Two networks topologies using different protocol stacks are investigated. Their performance evaluation is presented in terms of reliability and latency.',

	{'abstract': u'In this paper we present a way of hiding the data in mobile devices from being compromised. We use two level data hiding technique, where in its first level data is encrypted and stored in special records and the second level being a typical password protection scheme. The second level is for secure access of information from the device. In the first level, encryption of the data is done using the location coordinates as key. Location Coordinates are rounded up figures of longitude and latitude information. In the second phase the password entry differs from conventional schemes. Here we have used the patterns of traditional Rangoli for specifying the password and gaining access, thus minimising the chances of data leak in hostile situations. The proposed structure would be a better trade off in comparison with the previous models which use Bio Metric authentication -- a relatively costly way of authentication.',

	{'abstract': u'Network tomography aims at inferring internal network characteristics based on measurements at the edge of the network. In loss tomography, in particular, the characteristic of interest is the loss rate of individual links and multicast and/or unicast end-to-end probes are typically used. Independently, recent advances in network coding have shown that there are advantages from allowing intermediate nodes to process and combine, in addition to just forward, packets. In this paper, we study the problem of loss tomography in networks with network coding capabilities. We design a framework for estimating link loss rates, which leverages network coding capabilities, and we show that it improves several aspects of tomography including the identifiability of links, the trade-off between estimation accuracy and bandwidth efficiency, and the complexity of probe path selection. We discuss the cases of inferring link loss rates in a tree topology and in a general topology. In the latter case, the benefits of our approach are even more pronounced compared to standard techniques, but we also face novel challenges, such as dealing with cycles and multiple paths between sources and receivers. Overall, this work makes the connection between active network tomography and network coding.',

This IR-UWB channel capacity is obtained from the no ISI (Inter Symbol Interference) assumption and for binary modulations. The impact of the kind of implementation is considered on the IR-UWB channel capacity. This study is lead for mixed and mostly digital implementation. The key parameters and theirs impacts on the channel capacity are exposed in each case: the data converters for mostly digital implementations and the pulse generator capabilities for mixed implementations. Finally, these two implementations are compared from a data rate point of view. Their behaviors regarding an increase of the operating frequency are also studied.',

	{'abstract': u'Wireless networks are a common place nowadays and almost all of the modern devices support wireless communication in some form. These networks differ from more traditional computing systems due to the ad-hoc and spontaneous nature of interactions among devices. These systems are prone to security risks, such as eavesdropping and require different techniques as compared to traditional security mechanisms. Recently, secure device pairing in wireless environments has got substantial attention from many researchers. As a result, a significant set of techniques and protocols have been proposed to deal with this issue. Some of these techniques consider devices equipped with infrared, laser, ultrasound transceivers or 802.11 network interface cards; while others require embedded accelerometers, cameras and/or LEDs, displays, microphones and/or speakers. However, many of the proposed techniques or protocols have not been implemented at all; while others are implemented and evaluated in a stand-alone manner without being compared with other related work [1]. We believe that it is because of the lack of specialized tools that provide a common platform to test the pairing methods. As a consequence, we designed such a tool. In this paper, we are presenting design and development of the Pairing Simulator (PSim) that can be used to perform the analysis of device pairing methods.',

	{'abstract': u'Mathematical learning environments help students in mastering mathematical knowledge. Mature environments typically offer thousands of interactive exercises. Providing feedback to students solving interactive exercises requires domain reasoners for doing the exercise-specific calculations. Since a domain reasoner has to solve an exercise in the same way a student should solve it, the structure of domain reasoners should follow the layered structure of the mathematical domains. Furthermore, learners, teachers, and environment builders have different requirements for adapting domain reasoners, such as providing more details, disallowing or enforcing certain solutions, and combining multiple mathematical domains in a new domain. In previous work we have shown how domain reasoners for solving interactive exercises can be expressed in terms of rewrite strategies, rewrite rules, and views. This paper shows how users can adapt and configure such domain reasoners to their own needs. This is achieved by enabling users to explicitly communicate the components that are used for solving an exercise.',

They provide a well-defined behaviour as well as a simple query language that allows application developers to rapidly develop applications. Language models are particularly useful to reason about the ranking of search results, and for developing new ranking approaches. The unified model allows application developers to define complex language modeling approaches as logical queries on a textual database. We show a remarkable one-to-one relationship between region queries and the language models they represent for a wide variety of applications: simple ad-hoc search, cross-language retrieval, video retrieval, and web search.',

	{'abstract': u'Impulse Radio Ultra Wide Band (IR-UWB) is a promising technology to address Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) constraints. However, existing network simulation tools do not provide a complete WSN simulation architecture, with the IR-UWB specificities at the PHYsical (PHY) and the Medium Access Control (MAC) layers. In this paper, we propose a WSN simulation architecture based on the IR-UWB technique. At the PHY layer, we take into account the pulse collision by dealing with the pulse propagation delay. We also modelled MAC protocols specific to IRUWB, for WSN applications. To completely fit the WSN simulation requirements, we propose a generic and reusable sensor and sensing channel model. Most of the WSN application performances can be evaluated thanks to the proposed simulation architecture. The proposed models are implemented on a scalable and well known network simulator: Global Mobile Information System Simulator (GloMoSim). However, they can be reused for all other packet based simulation platforms.',

	{'abstract': u'Separation of the text regions from background texture and graphics is an important step of any optical character recognition sytem for the images containg both texts and graphics. In this paper, we have presented a novel text/graphics separation technique for business card images captured with a cell-phone camera. At first, the background is eliminated at a coarse level based on intensity variance. This makes the foreground components distinct from each other. Then the non-text components are removed using various characteristic features of text and graphics. Finally, the text regions are skew corrected and binarized for further processing. Experimenting with business card images of various resolutions, we have found an optimum performance of 98.54% with 0.75 MP images, that takes 0.17 seconds processing time and 1.1 MB peak memory on a moderately powerful computer (DualCore 1.73 GHz Processor, 1 GB RAM, 1 MB L2 Cache). The developed technique is computationally efficient and consumes low memory so as to be applicable on mobile devices.',

	{'abstract': u'Functional dependencies -- traditional, approximate and conditional are of critical importance in relational databases, as they inform us about the relationships between attributes. They are useful in schema normalization, data rectification and source selection. Most of these were however developed in the context of deterministic data. Although uncertain databases have started receiving attention, these dependencies have not been defined for them, nor are fast algorithms available to evaluate their confidences. This paper defines the logical extensions of various forms of functional dependencies for probabilistic databases and explores the connections between them. We propose a pruning-based exact algorithm to evaluate the confidence of functional dependencies, a Monte-Carlo based algorithm to evaluate the confidence of approximate functional dependencies and algorithms for their conditional counterparts in probabilistic databases. Experiments are performed on both synthetic and real data evaluating the performance of these algorithms in assessing the confidence of dependencies and mining them from data. We believe that having these dependencies and algorithms available for probabilistic databases will drive adoption of probabilistic data storage in the industry.',

	{'abstract': u'A neat 1972 result of Pohl asserts that [3n/2]-2 comparisons are sufficient, and also necessary in the worst case, for finding both the minimum and the maximum of an n-element totally ordered set. The set is accessed via an oracle for pairwise comparisons. More recently, the problem has been studied in the context of the Renyi-Ulam liar games, where the oracle may give up to k false answers. For large k, an upper bound due to Aigner shows that (k+O( sqrt))n comparisons suffice. We improve on this by providing an algorithm with at most (k+1+C)n+O(k^3) comparisons for some constant C. The known lower bounds are of the form (k+1+c_k)n-D, for some constant D, where c_0=0.5, c_1=23/32=0.71875, and c_k= Omega(2^) as k goes to infinity.',

	{'abstract': u'Nowadays, the IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) is a promising research field. Many ongoing works related to the security and the performances of its employment are presented to the research community. Although, the security and data privacy aspects are very important in the IMS global objectives, they observe little attention so far. Secure access to multimedia services is based on SIP and HTTP digest on top of IMS architecture. The standard deploys AKA-MD5 for the terminal authentication. The third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) provided Generic Bootstrapping Architecture (GBA) to authenticate the subscriber before accessing multimedia services over HTTP. In this paper, we propose a new IMS Service Authentication scheme using Identity Based cryptography (IBC). This new scheme will lead to better performances when there are simultaneous authentication requests using Identity-based Batch Verification. We analyzed the security of our new protocol and we presented a performance evaluation of its cryptographic operations',

	{'abstract': u'Topology is a fundamental part of a network that governs connectivity between nodes, the amount of data flow and the efficiency of data flow between nodes. In traditional networks, due to physical limitations, topology remains static for the course of the network operation. Ubiquitous data networks (UDNs), alternatively, are more adaptive and can be configured for changes in their topology. This flexibility in controlling their topology makes them very appealing and an attractive medium for supporting "anywhere, any place" communication. However, it raises the problem of designing a dynamic topology. The dynamic topology design problem is of particular interest to application service providers who need to provide cost-effective data services on a ubiquitous network. In this paper we describe algorithms that decide when and how the topology should be reconfigured in response to a change in the data communication requirements of the network. In particular, we describe and compare a greedy algorithm, which is often used for topology reconfiguration, with a non-greedy algorithm based on metrical task systems. Experiments show the algorithm based on metrical task system has comparable performance to the greedy algorithm at a much lower reconfiguration cost.',

Although computer programs for the visualization of social networks increasingly allow us to represent heterogeneity in a network using different shapes and colors for the visualization, hitherto this possibility has scarcely been exploited (Mogoutov et al., 2008). In this contribution to the Festschrift, I study the question of what heterogeneity can add specifically to the visualization of a network. How does an integrated network improve on the one-dimensional ones (such as co-word and co-author maps)?

	{'abstract': u'In this paper a novel method called Extended Two-Dimensional PCA (E2DPCA) is proposed which is an extension to the original 2DPCA. We state that the covariance matrix of 2DPCA is equivalent to the average of the main diagonal of the covariance matrix of PCA. This implies that 2DPCA eliminates some covariance information that can be useful for recognition. E2DPCA instead of just using the main diagonal considers a radius of r diagonals around it and expands the averaging so as to include the covariance information within those diagonals. The parameter r unifies PCA and 2DPCA. r = 1 produces the covariance of 2DPCA, r = n that of PCA. Hence, by controlling r it is possible to control the trade-offs between recognition accuracy and energy compression (fewer coefficients), and between training and recognition complexity. Experiments on ORL face database show improvement in both recognition accuracy and recognition time over the original 2DPCA.',

	{'abstract': u'This article introduces yet another representation of rotations in 3-space. The rotations form a 3-dimensional projective space, which fact has not been exploited in Computer Science. We use the four affine patches of this projective space to parametrize the rotations. This affine patch representation is more compact than quaternions (which require 4 components for calculations), encompasses the entire rotation group without singularities (unlike the Euler angles and rotation vector approaches), and requires only ratios of linear or quadratic polynomials for basic computations (unlike the Euler angles and rotation vector approaches which require transcendental functions). As an example, we derive the differential equation for the integration of angular velocity using this affine patch representation of rotations. We remark that the complexity of this equation is the same as the corresponding quaternion equation, but has advantages over the quaternion approach e.g. renormalization to unit length is not required, and state space has no dead directions.',

In many applications, the string itself need be maintained dynamically, allowing characters of the string to be inserted and deleted.

	{'abstract': u'Often one has a preference order among the different systems that satisfy a given specification. Under a probabilistic assumption about the possible inputs, such a preference order is naturally expressed by a weighted automaton, which assigns to each word a value, such that a system is preferred if it generates a higher expected value. We solve the following optimal-synthesis problem: given an omega-regular specification, a Markov chain that describes the distribution of inputs, and a weighted automaton that measures how well a system satisfies the given specification under the given input assumption, synthesize a system that optimizes the measured value. For safety specifications and measures given by mean-payoff automata, the optimal-synthesis problem amounts to finding a strategy in a Markov decision process (MDP) that is optimal for a long-run average reward objective, which can be done in polynomial time. For general omega-regular specifications, the solution rests on a new, polynomial-time algorithm for computing optimal strategies in MDPs with mean-payoff parity objectives. Our algorithm generates optimal strategies consisting of two memoryless strategies and a counter. This counter is in general not bounded. To obtain a finite-state system, we show how to construct an epsilon-optimal strategy with a bounded counter for any epsilon&gt;0. We also show how to decide in polynomial time if we can construct an optimal finite-state system (i.e., a system without a counter) for a given specification. We have implemented our approach in a tool that takes qualitative and quantitative specifications and automatically constructs a system that satisfies the qualitative specification and optimizes the quantitative specification, if such a system exists. We present experimental results showing optimal systems that were generated in this way.',

This paper proposes to use Cousot and Cousot's Cardinal power domain to capture functional dependencies of analysis output on its input and obtain a parametric analysis by parametrizing a non-parametric base analysis. We illustrate the method by parametrizing a based groundness analysis of logic programs to a parametric groundness analysis.

	{'abstract': u'Modern large-scale date centres, such as those used for cloud computing service provision, are becoming ever-larger as the operators of those data centres seek to maximise the benefits from economies of scale. With these increases in size comes a growth in system complexity, which is usually problematic. There is an increased desire for automated "self-star" configuration, management, and failure-recovery of the data-centre infrastructure, but many traditional techniques scale much worse than linearly as the number of nodes to be managed increases. As the number of nodes in a median-sized data-centre looks set to increase by two or three orders of magnitude in coming decades, it seems reasonable to attempt to explore and understand the scaling properties of the data-centre middleware before such data-centres are constructed. In [1] we presented SPECI, a simulator that predicts aspects of large-scale data-centre middleware performance, concentrating on the influence of status changes such as policy updates or routine node failures. [...]. In [1] we used a first-approximation assumption that such subscriptions are distributed wholly at random across the data centre. In this present paper, we explore the effects of introducing more realistic constraints to the structure of the internal network of subscriptions. We contrast the original results [...] exploring the effects of making the data-centre\'s subscription network have a regular lattice-like structure, and also semi-random network structures resulting from parameterised network generation functions that create "small-world" and "scale-free" networks. We show that for distributed middleware topologies, the structure and distribution of tasks carried out in the data centre can significantly influence the performance overhead imposed by the middleware.',

	{'abstract': u'This paper presents a combination of several automated reasoning and proof presentation tools with the Mizar system for formalization of mathematics. The combination forms an online service called MizAR, similar to the SystemOnTPTP service for first-order automated reasoning. The main differences to SystemOnTPTP are the use of the Mizar language that is oriented towards human mathematicians (rather than the pure first-order logic used in SystemOnTPTP), and setting the service in the context of the large Mizar Mathematical Library of previous theorems,definitions, and proofs (rather than the isolated problems that are solved in SystemOnTPTP). These differences poses new challenges and new opportunities for automated reasoning and for proof presentation tools. This paper describes the overall structure of MizAR, and presents the automated reasoning systems and proof presentation tools that are combined to make MizAR a useful mathematical service.',

	{'abstract': u'We are developing electronic dictionaries and transducers for the automatic processing of the Albanian Language. We will analyze the words inside a linear segment of text. We will also study the relationship between units of sense and units of form. The composition of words takes different forms in Albanian. We have found that morphemes are frequently concatenated or simply juxtaposed or contracted. The inflected grammar of NooJ allows constructing the dictionaries of flexed forms (declensions or conjugations). The diversity of word structures requires tools to identify words created by simple concatenation, or to treat contractions. The morphological tools of NooJ allow us to create grammatical tools to represent and treat these phenomena. But certain problems exceed the morphological analysis and must be represented by syntactical grammars.',

	{'abstract': u'In 1975 Chaitin introduced his Omega number as a concrete example of random real. The real Omega is defined based on the set of all halting inputs for an optimal prefix-free machine U, which is a universal decoding algorithm used to define the notion of program-size complexity. Chaitin showed Omega to be random by discovering the property that the first n bits of the base-two expansion of Omega solve the halting problem of U for all binary inputs of length at most n. In this paper, we introduce a new representation Theta of Chaitin Omega number. The real Theta is defined based on the set of all compressible strings. We investigate the properties of Theta and show that Theta is random. In addition, we generalize Theta to two directions Theta(T) and bar(T) with a real T&gt;0. We then study their properties. In particular, we show that the computability of the real Theta(T) gives a sufficient condition for a real T in (0,1) to be a fixed point on partial randomness, i.e., to satisfy the condition that the compression rate of T equals to T.',

	{'abstract': u'We consider the links between Ramsey theory in the integers, based on van der Waerden\'s theorem, and (boolean, CNF) SAT solving. We aim at using the problems from exact Ramsey theory, concerned with computing Ramsey-type numbers, as a rich source of test problems, where especially methods for solving hard problems can be developed. In order to control the growth of the problem instances, we introduce "transversal extensions" as a natural way of constructing mixed parameter tuples (k_1, ..., k_m) for van-der-Waerden-like numbers N(k_1, ..., k_m), such that the growth of these numbers is guaranteed to be linear. Based on Green-Tao\'s theorem we introduce the "Green-Tao numbers" grt(k_1, ..., k_m), which in a sense combine the strict structure of van der Waerden problems with the (pseudo-)randomness of the distribution of prime numbers. Using standard SAT solvers (look-ahead, conflict-driven, and local search) we determine the basic values. It turns out that already for this single form of Ramsey-type problems, when considering the best-performing solvers a wide variety of solver types is covered. For m &gt; 2 the problems are non-boolean, and we introduce the "generic translation scheme", which offers an infinite variety of translations ("encodings") and covers the known methods. In most cases the special instance called "nested translation" proved to be far superior.',

For the past 20 years, various formats have been proposed for encoding movement, especially gestures. Though, these formats, at different degrees, were designed in the context of quite specific applications (character animation, motion capture, musical gesture, biomechanical concerns...). The article introduce a new file format, called GMS (for \'Gesture and Motion Signal\'), with the aim of being more low-level and generic, by defining the minimal features a format carrying movement/gesture information needs, rather than by gathering all the information generally given by the existing formats. The article argues that, given its growing presence in virtual reality situations, the "gesture signal" itself must be encoded, and that a specific format is needed. The proposed format features the inner properties of such signals: dimensionality, structural features, types of variables, and spatial and temporal properties. The article first reviews the various situations with multisensory virtual objects in which gesture controls intervene. The proposed format is then deduced, as a mean to encode such versatile and variable "gestural and animated scene".',

	{'abstract': u"The recognition of Arabic Named Entities (NE) is a problem in different domains of Natural Language Processing (NLP) like automatic translation. Indeed, NE translation allows the access to multilingual in-formation. This translation doesn't always lead to expected result especially when NE contains a person name. For this reason and in order to ameliorate translation, we can transliterate some part of NE. In this context, we propose a method that integrates translation and transliteration together. We used the linguis-tic NooJ platform that is based on local grammars and transducers. In this paper, we focus on sport domain. We will firstly suggest a refinement of the typological model presented at the MUC Conferences we will describe the integration of an Arabic transliteration module into translation system. Finally, we will detail our method and give the results of the evaluation.",

	{'abstract': u'This paper is focused on the question of simulation and visualiza- tion of 3D gel and paste dynamic effects. In a first part, we introduce a 3D physically based particle (or mass-interaction) model, with a small number of masses and few powerful interaction parameters, which is able to generate the dynamic features of both gels and pastes. This model proves that the 3D mass-interaction method is relevant for the simulation of such phenomena, without an explicit knowledge of their underly- ing physics. In a second part, we expose an original rendering process, the Flow Structuring Method that enhances the dynamic properties of the simulation and offers a realistic visualization. This process ignores all the properties of the underlying physical model. It leads to a reconstruction of the spatial structure of the gel (or paste) flow only through an analysis of the output of the simula- tion which is a set of unorganized points moving in a 3D space. Finally, the paper presents realistic renderings obtained by using implicit surfaces and ray-tracing techniques on the Structured Flow previously obtained.',

	{'abstract': u'If the use of the apostrophe in contemporary English often marks the Saxon genitive, it may also indicate the omission of one or more let-ters. Some writers (wrongly?) use it to mark the plural in symbols or abbreviations, visual-ised thanks to the isolation of the morpheme "s". This punctuation mark was imported from the Continent in the 16th century. During the 19th century its use was standardised. However the rules of its usage still seem problematic to many, including literate speakers of English. "All too often, the apostrophe is misplaced", or "errant apostrophes are springing up every-where" is a complaint that Internet users fre-quently come across when visiting grammar websites. Many of them detail its various uses and misuses, and attempt to correct the most common mistakes about it, especially its mis-use in the plural, called greengrocers\' apostro-phes and humorously misspelled "greengro-cers apostrophe\'s". While studying English travel accounts published in the seventeenth century, we noticed that the different uses of this symbol may accompany various models of metaplasms. We were able to highlight the linguistic variations of some lexemes, and trace the origin of modern grammar rules gov-erning its usage.',

	{'abstract': u'Computer System Administration and Network Administration are few such areas where Practical Extraction Reporting Language (Perl) has robust utilization these days apart from Bioinformatics. The key role of a System/Network Administrator is to monitor log files. Log file are updated every day. To scan the summary of large log files and to quickly determine if there is anything wrong with the server or network we develop a Firewall Log Status Reporter (SRr). SRr helps to generate the reports based on the parameters of interest. SRr provides the facility to admin to generate the individual firewall report or all reports in one go. By scrutinizing the results of the reports admin can trace how many times a particular request has been made from which source to which destination and can track the errors easily. Perl scripts can be seen as the UNIX script replacement in future arena and SRr is one development with the same hope that we can believe in. SRr is a generalized and customizable utility completely written in Perl and may be used for text mining and data mining application in Bioinformatics research and development too.',

Moreover, computing a partition with maximum egalitarian or utilitarian social welfare or one which is both Pareto optimal and individually rational is NP-hard. We also prove that checking whether there exists a partition which is both Pareto optimal and envy-free is -complete.

	{'abstract': u'An intrusion detection system framework using mobile agents is a layered framework mechanism designed to support heterogeneous network environments to identify intruders at its best. Traditional computer misuse detection techniques can identify known attacks efficiently, but perform very poorly in other cases. Anomaly detection has the potential to detect unknown attacks; however, it is a very challenging task since its aim is to detect unknown attacks without any priori knowledge about specific intrusions. This technology is still at its early stage. The objective of this paper is that the system can detect anomalous user activity. Existing research in this area focuses either on user activity or on program operation but not on both simultaneously. In this paper, an attempt to look at both concurrently is presented. Based on an intrusion detection framework [1], a novel user anomaly detection system has been implemented and conducted several intrusion detection experiments in a simulated environment by analyzing user activity and program operation activities. The proposed framework is a layered framework, which is designed to satisfy the core purpose of IDS, and allows detecting the intrusion as quickly as possible with available data using mobile agents. This framework was mainly designed to provide security for the network using mobile agent mechanisms to add mobility features to monitor the user processes from different computational systems. The experimental results have shown that the system can detect anomalous user activity effectively.',

	{'abstract': u"The search for patterns or motifs in data represents an area of key interest to many researchers. In this paper we present the Motif Tracking Algorithm, a novel immune inspired pattern identification tool that is able to identify unknown motifs which repeat within time series data. The power of the algorithm is derived from its use of a small number of parameters with minimal assumptions. The algorithm searches from a completely neutral perspective that is independent of the data being analysed, and the underlying motifs. In this paper the motif tracking algorithm is applied to the search for patterns within sequences of low level system calls between the Linux kernel and the operating system's user space. The MTA is able to compress data found in large system call data sets to a limited number of motifs which summarise that data. The motifs provide a resource from which a profile of executed processes can be built. The potential for these profiles and new implications for security research are highlighted. A higher level call system language for measuring similarity between patterns of such calls is also suggested.",

Our protocol utilizes a photon in superposition state for single-bit data transmission instead of a classical electrical/optical signal. The security of this protocol relies on the fact, that the arbitrary quantum state cannot be cloned, known as the no-cloning theorem. This protocol can be implemented with current technologies.',

	{'abstract': u'The problem of estimating the proportion of satisfiable instances of a given CSP (constraint satisfaction problem) can be tackled through weighting. It consists in putting onto each solution a non-negative real value based on its neighborhood in a way that the total weight is at least 1 for each satisfiable instance. We define in this paper a general weighting scheme for the estimation of satisfiability of general CSPs. First we give some sufficient conditions for a weighting system to be correct. Then we show that this scheme allows for an improvement on the upper bound on the existence of non-trivial cores in 3-SAT obtained by Maneva and Sinclair (2008) to 4.419. Another more common way of estimating satisfiability is ordering. This consists in putting a total order on the domain, which induces an orientation between neighboring solutions in a way that prevents circuits from appearing, and then counting only minimal elements. We compare ordering and weighting under various conditions.',

	{'abstract': u'Interference alignment is a transmission technique for exploiting all available degrees of freedom in the interference channel with an arbitrary number of users. Most prior work on interference alignment, however, neglects interference from other nodes in the network not participating in the alignment operation. This paper proposes three generalizations of interference alignment for the multiple-antenna interference channel with multiple users that account for colored noise, which models uncoordinated interference. First, a minimum interference-plus-noise leakage algorithm is presented, and shown to be equivalent to previous subspace methods when noise is spatially white or negligible. A joint minimum mean squared error design is then proposed that jointly optimizes the transmit precoders and receive spatial filters, whereas previous designs neglect the receive spatial filter. This algorithm is shown to be a generalization of previous joint MMSE designs for other system configurations such as the broadcast channel. Finally, a maximum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio algorithm is developed that is proven to converge, unlike previous maximum SINR algorithms. The latter two designs are shown to have increased complexity due to non-orthogonal precoders, more required iterations, or more channel state knowledge than the min INL or subspace methods. The sum throughput performance of these algorithms is simulated in the context of a network with uncoordinated co-channel interferers not participating in the alignment protocol. It is found that a network with cochannel interference can benefit from employing precoders designed to consider that interference, but in some cases, ignoring the co-channel interference is advantageous.',

Transmission energy is the most concern part where the higher energy consumption takes place.

	{'abstract': u'We consider the problem of intruder deduction in security protocol analysis: that is, deciding whether a given message M can be deduced from a set of messages Gamma under the theory of blind signatures and arbitrary convergent equational theories modulo associativity and commutativity (AC) of certain binary operators. The traditional formulations of intruder deduction are usually given in natural-deduction-like systems and proving decidability requires significant effort in showing that the rules are "local" in some sense. By using the well-known translation between natural deduction and sequent calculus, we recast the intruder deduction problem as proof search in sequent calculus, in which locality is immediate. Using standard proof theoretic methods, such as permutability of rules and cut elimination, we show that the intruder deduction problem can be reduced, in polynomial time, to the elementary deduction problem, which amounts to solving certain equations in the underlying individual equational theories. We show that this result extends to combinations of disjoint AC-convergent theories whereby the decidability of intruder deduction under the combined theory reduces to the decidability of elementary deduction in each constituent theory. To further demonstrate the utility of the sequent-based approach, we show that, for Dolev-Yao intruders, our sequent-based techniques can be used to solve the more difficult problem of solving deducibility constraints, where the sequents to be deduced may contain gaps (or variables) representing possible messages the intruder may produce.',

One of growing concerns is the coexistence of heterogeneous wireless network systems. For the successful deployment of mission-critical systems such as wireless sensor networks, it is required to provide a solution for the coexistence. In this paper, we propose a new scheme using inter packet delay for the coexistence of IEEE 802.15.4 LRWPAN and IEEE 802.11b WLAN. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme, measurement and simulation study are conducted using Qualnet 4.5 simulation software. The simulation results show that the proposed scheme is effective in performance improvement for coexistence network of IEEE 802.15.4 for various topologies.',

	{'abstract': u'Mobile Ad hoc NETworks (MANETs) are leaving the confines of research laboratories, to find place in real-world deployments. Outside specialized domains (military, vehicular, etc.), city-wide communitynetworks are emerging, connecting regular Internet users with each other, and with the Internet, via MANETs. Growing to encompass more than a handful of "trusted participants", the question of preserving the MANET network connectivity, even when faced with careless or malicious participants, arises, and must be addressed. A first step towards protecting a MANET is to analyze the vulnerabilities of the routing protocol, managing the connectivity. By understanding how the algorithms of the routing protocol operate, and how these can be exploited by those with ill intent, countermeasures can be developed, readying MANETs for wider deployment and use. This paper takes an abstract look at the algorithms that constitute the Optimized Link State Routing Protocol version 2 (OLSRv2), and identifies for each protocol element the possible vulnerabilities and attacks -- in a certain way, provides a "cookbook" for how to best attack an operational OLSRv2 network, or for how to proceed with developing protective countermeasures against these attacks.',

The monitoring is done by checking each packet for its validity against the signatures formulated for identified vulnerabilities. Since, signatures are the heart &amp; soul of an Intrusion Detection and Prevention System (IDPS), we, in this paper, discuss two methodologies we adapted in our research effort to improve the current Intrusion Detection and Prevention (IDP) systems. The first methodology RUDRAA is for formulating, verifying &amp; validating the potential signatures to be used with IDPS. The second methodology DSP-FED is aimed at processing the signatures in less time with our proposed fast elimination method using DFA. The research objectives of this project are 1) To formulate &amp; process potential IPS signatures to be used with Intrusion prevention system. 2) To propose a DFA based approach for signature processing which, upon a pattern match, could process the signatures faster else could eliminate it efficiently if not matched',

When it was noted that quantum computers could break public key cryptosystems based on number theory extensive studies have been undertaken on QKD. Based on quantum mechanics, QKD offers unconditionally secure communication. Now, the progress of research in this field allows the anticipation of QKD to be available outside of laboratories within the next few years. Efforts are made to improve the performance and reliability of the implemented technologies. But several challenges remain despite this big progress. The task of how to test the apparatuses of QKD For example did not yet receive enough attention. These devises become complex and demand a big verification effort. In this paper we are interested in an approach based on the technique of probabilistic model checking for studying quantum information. Precisely, we use the PRISM tool to analyze the security of BB84 protocol and we are focused on the specific security property of eavesdropping detection. We show that this property is affected by the parameters of quantum channel and the power of eavesdropper.',

	{'abstract': u'Ear biometric is considered as one of the most reliable and invariant biometrics characteristics in line with iris and fingerprint characteristics. In many cases, ear biometrics can be compared with face biometrics regarding many physiological and texture characteristics. In this paper, a robust and efficient ear recognition system is presented, which uses Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) as feature descriptor for structural representation of ear images. In order to make it more robust to user authentication, only the regions having color probabilities in a certain ranges are considered for invariant SIFT feature extraction, where the K-L divergence is used for keeping color consistency. Ear skin color model is formed by Gaussian mixture model and clustering the ear color pattern using vector quantization. Finally, K-L divergence is applied to the GMM framework for recording the color similarity in the specified ranges by comparing color similarity between a pair of reference model and probe ear images. After segmentation of ear images in some color slice regions, SIFT keypoints are extracted and an augmented vector of extracted SIFT features are created for matching, which is accomplished between a pair of reference model and probe ear images. The proposed technique has been tested on the IITK Ear database and the experimental results show improvements in recognition accuracy while invariant features are extracted from color slice regions to maintain the robustness of the system.',

	{'abstract': u"The objective of this is to develop a Fuzzy aided Application layer Semantic Intrusion Detection System (FASIDS) which works in the application layer of the network stack. FASIDS consist of semantic IDS and Fuzzy based IDS. Rule based IDS looks for the specific pattern which is defined as malicious. A non-intrusive regular pattern can be malicious if it occurs several times with a short time interval. For detecting such malicious activities, FASIDS is proposed in this paper. At application layer, HTTP traffic's header and payload are analyzed for possible intrusion. In the proposed misuse detection module, the semantic intrusion detection system works on the basis of rules that define various application layer misuses that are found in the network. An attack identified by the IDS is based on a corresponding rule in the rule-base. An event that doesn't make a 'hit' on the rule-base is given to a Fuzzy Intrusion Detection System (FIDS) for further analysis.",

	{'abstract': u'This paper presents a new face identification system based on Graph Matching Technique on SIFT features extracted from face images. Although SIFT features have been successfully used for general object detection and recognition, only recently they were applied to face recognition. This paper further investigates the performance of identification techniques based on Graph matching topology drawn on SIFT features which are invariant to rotation, scaling and translation. Face projections on images, represented by a graph, can be matched onto new images by maximizing a similarity function taking into account spatial distortions and the similarities of the local features. Two graph based matching techniques have been investigated to deal with false pair assignment and reducing the number of features to find the optimal feature set between database and query face SIFT features. The experimental results, performed on the BANCA database, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system for automatic face identification.',

	{'abstract': u'Cryptographic check values (digital signatures, MACs and H-MACs) are useful only if they are free of errors. For that reason all of errors in cryptographic check values should be corrected after the transmission over a noisy channel before their verification is performed. Soft Input Decryption is a method of combining SISO convolutional decoding and decrypting of cryptographic check values to improve the correction of errors in themselves. If Soft Input Decryption is successful, i.e. all wrong bit of a cryptographic check value are corrected, these bit are sent as feedback information to the channel decoder for a next iteration. The bit of the next iteration are corrected by channel decoding followed by another Soft Input Decryption. Iterative Soft Input Decryption uses interleaved blocks. If one block can be corrected by Soft Input Decryption, the decoding of the interleaved block is improved (serial scheme). If Soft Input Decryption is applied on both blocks and one of the blocks can be corrected, the corrected block is used for an improved decoding of the other block (parallel scheme). Both schemes show significant coding gains compared to convolutional decoding without iterative Soft Input Decryption.',

	{'abstract': u'Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology one of the most promising technologies in the field of ubiquitous computing. Indeed, RFID technology may well replace barcode technology. Although it offers many advantages over other identification systems, there are also associated security risks that are not easy to be addressed. When designing a real lightweight authentication protocol for low cost RFID tags, a number of challenges arise due to the extremely limited computational, storage and communication abilities of Low-cost RFID tags. This paper proposes a real mutual authentication protocol for low cost RFID tags. The proposed protocol prevents passive attacks as active attacks are discounted when designing a protocol to meet the requirements of low cost RFID tags. However the implementation of the protocol meets the limited abilities of low cost RFID tags.',

To mitigate this performance loss, we propose an efficient algorithm, which is based on an i.i.d. Gaussian model for the distortion caused by these impairments.

	{'abstract': u"In multi-hop wireless systems, the need for cooperation among nodes to relay each other's packets exposes them to a wide range of security attacks. A particularly devastating attack is the wormhole attack, where a malicious node records control traffic at one location and tunnels it to another compromised node, possibly far away, which replays it locally. Routing security in ad hoc networks is often equated with strong and feasible node authentication and lightweight cryptography. Unfortunately, the wormhole attack can hardly be defeated by crypto graphical measures, as wormhole attackers do not create separate packets. They simply replay packets already existing on the network, which pass the cryptographic checks. Existing works on wormhole detection have often focused on detection using specialized hardware, such as directional antennas, etc. In this paper, we present a cluster based counter-measure for the wormhole attack, that alleviates these drawbacks and efficiently mitigates the wormhole attack in MANET. Simulation results on MATLab exhibit the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in detecting wormhole attacks.",

	{'abstract': u'In this paper, a new learning algorithm for adaptive network intrusion detection using naive Bayesian classifier and decision tree is presented, which performs balance detections and keeps false positives at acceptable level for different types of network attacks, and eliminates redundant attributes as well as contradictory examples from training data that make the detection model complex. The proposed algorithm also addresses some difficulties of data mining such as handling continuous attribute, dealing with missing attribute values, and reducing noise in training data. Due to the large volumes of security audit data as well as the complex and dynamic properties of intrusion behaviours, several data miningbased intrusion detection techniques have been applied to network-based traffic data and host-based data in the last decades. However, there remain various issues needed to be examined towards current intrusion detection systems (IDS). We tested the performance of our proposed algorithm with existing learning algorithms by employing on the KDD99 benchmark intrusion detection dataset. The experimental results prove that the proposed algorithm achieved high detection rates (DR) and significant reduce false positives (FP) for different types of network intrusions using limited computational resources.',

As biometric features posses no natural order of sorting, thus it is difficult to index them alphabetically or numerically. Hence, some supervised criteria is required to partition the search space. At the time of identification the fuzziness criterion is introduced to find the nearest clusters for declaring the identity of query sample.

	{'abstract': u'Genetic algorithms are a population-based Meta heuristics. They have been successfully applied to many optimization problems. However, premature convergence is an inherent characteristic of such classical genetic algorithms that makes them incapable of searching numerous solutions of the problem domain. A memetic algorithm is an extension of the traditional genetic algorithm. It uses a local search technique to reduce the likelihood of the premature convergence. The cryptanalysis of simplified data encryption standard can be formulated as NP-Hard combinatorial problem. In this paper, a comparison between memetic algorithm and genetic algorithm were made in order to investigate the performance for the cryptanalysis on simplified data encryption standard problems(SDES). The methods were tested and various experimental results show that memetic algorithm performs better than the genetic algorithms for such type of NP-Hard combinatorial problem. This paper represents our first effort toward efficient memetic algorithm for the cryptanalysis of SDES.',

	{'abstract': u'Distributed power control over interference limited network has received an increasing intensity of interest over the past few years. Distributed solutions (like the iterative water-filling, gradient projection, etc.) have been intensively investigated under emph channels. However, as such distributed solutions involve iterative updating and explicit message passing, it is unrealistic to assume that the wireless channel remains unchanged during the iterations. Unfortunately, the behavior of those distributed solutions under emph channels is in general unknown. In this paper, we shall investigate the distributed scaled gradient projection algorithm (DSGPA) in a pairs multicarrier interference network under a finite-state Markov channel (FSMC) model. We shall analyze the emph as well as emph of the proposed DSGPA. Our analysis shows that the proposed DSGPA converges to a limit region rather than a single point under the FSMC model. We also show that the order of growth of the tracking errors is given by , where is the emph of the FSMC. Based on the analysis, we shall derive the emph via Markov decision process modeling. We shall show that the tracking error optimal scaling matrices can be implemented distributively at each transmitter. The numerical results show the superior performance of the proposed DSGPA over three baseline schemes, such as the gradient projection algorithm with a constant stepsize.',

	{'abstract': u'Faces are highly deformable objects which may easily change their appearance over time. Not all face areas are subject to the same variability. Therefore decoupling the information from independent areas of the face is of paramount importance to improve the robustness of any face recognition technique. This paper presents a robust face recognition technique based on the extraction and matching of SIFT features related to independent face areas. Both a global and local (as recognition from parts) matching strategy is proposed. The local strategy is based on matching individual salient facial SIFT features as connected to facial landmarks such as the eyes and the mouth. As for the global matching strategy, all SIFT features are combined together to form a single feature. In order to reduce the identification errors, the Dempster-Shafer decision theory is applied to fuse the two matching techniques. The proposed algorithms are evaluated with the ORL and the IITK face databases. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and potential of the proposed face recognition techniques also in the case of partially occluded faces or with missing information.',

	{'abstract': u'One popular approach to soft-decision decoding of Reed-Solomon (RS) codes is based on using multiple trials of a simple RS decoding algorithm in combination with erasing or flipping a set of symbols or bits in each trial. This paper presents a framework based on rate-distortion (RD) theory to analyze these multiple-decoding algorithms. By defining an appropriate distortion measure between an error pattern and an erasure pattern, the successful decoding condition, for a single errors-and-erasures decoding trial, becomes equivalent to distortion being less than a fixed threshold. Finding the best set of erasure patterns also turns into a covering problem which can be solved asymptotically by rate-distortion theory. Thus, the proposed approach can be used to understand the asymptotic performance-versus-complexity trade-off of multiple errors-and-erasures decoding of RS codes. This initial result is also extended a few directions. The rate-distortion exponent (RDE) is computed to give more precise results for moderate blocklengths. Multiple trials of algebraic soft-decision (ASD) decoding are analyzed using this framework. Analytical and numerical computations of the RD and RDE functions are also presented. Finally, simulation results show that sets of erasure patterns designed using the proposed methods outperform other algorithms with the same number of decoding trials.',

	{'abstract': u'Auctions play an important role in electronic commerce, and have been used to solve problems in distributed computing. Automated approaches to designing effective auction mechanisms are helpful in reducing the burden of traditional game theoretic, analytic approaches and in searching through the large space of possible auction mechanisms. This paper presents an approach to automated mechanism design (AMD) in the domain of double auctions. We describe a novel parametrized space of double auctions, and then introduce an evolutionary search method that searches this space of parameters. The approach evaluates auction mechanisms using the framework of the TAC Market Design Game and relates the performance of the markets in that game to their constituent parts using reinforcement learning. Experiments show that the strongest mechanisms we found using this approach not only win the Market Design Game against known, strong opponents, but also exhibit desirable economic properties when they run in isolation.',

	{'abstract': u'Network forensics deals with the capture, recording and analysis of network events in order to discover evidential information about the source of security attacks in a court of law. This paper discusses the different tools and techniques available to conduct network forensics. Some of the tools discussed include: eMailTrackerPro to identify the physical location of an email sender; Web Historian to find the duration of each visit and the files uploaded and downloaded from the visited website; packet sniffers like Etherea to capture and analyze the data exchanged among the different computers in the network. The second half of the paper presents a survey of different IP traceback techniques like packet marking that help a forensic investigator to identify the true sources of the attacking IP packets. We also discuss the use of Honeypots and Honeynets that gather intelligence about the enemy and the tools and tactics of network intruders.',

	{'abstract': u"This paper introduces the notion of a secure data capsule, which refers to an encapsulation of sensitive user information (such as a credit card number) along with code that implements an interface suitable for the use of such information (such as charging for purchases) by a service (such as an online merchant). In our capsule framework, users provide their data in the form of such capsules to web services rather than raw data. Capsules can be deployed in a variety of ways, either on a trusted third party or the user's own computer or at the service itself, through the use of a variety of hardware or software modules, such as a virtual machine monitor or trusted platform module: the only requirement is that the deployment mechanism must ensure that the user's data is only accessed via the interface sanctioned by the user. The framework further allows an user to specify policies regarding which services or machines may host her capsule, what parties are allowed to access the interface, and with what parameters. The combination of interface restrictions and policy control lets us bound the impact of an attacker who compromises the service to gain access to the user's capsule or a malicious insider at the service itself.",

	{'abstract': u'The main function of IDS (Intrusion Detection System) is to protect the system, analyze and predict the behaviors of users. Then these behaviors will be considered an attack or a normal behavior. Though IDS has been developed for many years, the large number of return alert messages makes managers maintain system inefficiently. In this paper, we use RST (Rough Set Theory) and SVM (Support Vector Machine) to detect intrusions. First, RST is used to preprocess the data and reduce the dimensions. Next, the features were selected by RST will be sent to SVM model to learn and test respectively. The method is effective to decrease the space density of data. The experiments will compare the results with different methods and show RST and SVM schema could improve the false positive rate and accuracy.',

We describe the game in detail, before presenting a suitable encoding scheme and fitness function for candidate solutions. We then compare the performance of the genetic algorithm with that of the A* algorithm. Our results show that the GA is competitive with informed search in terms of solution quality, and significantly out-performs it in terms of computational resource requirements. We conclude with a brief discussion of the implications of our findings for game solving and other "real world" problems.',

	{'abstract': u'This paper presents a modeling process in order to produce a realistic simulation of crowds in the ancient Greek agora of Argos. This place was a social theater in which two kinds of collective phenomena took place: interpersonal interactions (small group discussion and negotiation, etc.) and global collective phenomena, such as flowing and jamming. In this paper, we focus on the second type of collective human phenomena, called non-deliberative emergent crowd phenomena. This is a typical case of collective emergent self-organization. When a great number of individuals move within a confined environment and under a common fate, collective structures appear spontaneously: jamming with inner collapses, organized flowing with queues, curls, and vortices, propagation effects, etc. These are particularly relevant features to enhance the realism - more precisely the "truthfulness" - of models of this kind of collective phenomena. We assume that this truthfulness is strongly associated with the concept of emergence: evolutions are not predetermined by the individual characters, but emerge from the interaction of numerous characters. The evolutions are not repetitive, and evolve on the basis of small changes. This paper demonstrates that the physically-based interacting particles system is an adequate candidate to model emergent crowd effects: it associates a large number of elementary dynamic actors via elementary non-linear dynamic interactions. Our model of the scene is regulated as a large, dynamically coupled network of second order differential automata. We take advantage of symbolic non-photorealistic and efficient visualization to render the style of the person, rather than the person itself. As an artistic representation, NPR reinforces the symbolic acceptance of the scene by the observer, triggering an immediate and intuitive recognition of the scene as a plausible scene from ancient Greece.',

The aim of this research is to develop an intrusion detection system based on the function of Dendritic Cells (DCs). DCs are antigen presenting cells and key to activation of the human immune system, behaviour which has been abstracted to form the Dendritic Cell Algorithm (DCA). In algorithmic terms, individual DCs perform multi-sensor data fusion, asynchronously correlating the the fused data signals with a secondary data stream. Aggregate output of a population of cells, is analysed and forms the basis of an anomaly detection system. In this paper the DCA is applied to the detection of outgoing port scans using TCP SYN packets. Results show that detection can be achieved with the DCA, yet some false positives can be encountered when simultaneously scanning and using other network services. Suggestions are made for using adaptive signals to alleviate this uncovered problem.',

	{'abstract': u"Cognitive radio methodologies have the potential to dramatically increase the throughput of wireless systems. Herein, control strategies which enable the superposition in time and frequency of primary and secondary user transmissions are explored in contrast to more traditional sensing approaches which only allow the secondary user to transmit when the primary user is idle. In this work, the optimal transmission policy for the secondary user when the primary user adopts a retransmission based error control scheme is investigated. The policy aims to maximize the secondary users' throughput, with a constraint on the throughput loss and failure probability of the primary user. Due to the constraint, the optimal policy is randomized, and determines how often the secondary user transmits according to the retransmission state of the packet being served by the primary user. The resulting optimal strategy of the secondary user is proven to have a unique structure. In particular, the optimal throughput is achieved by the secondary user by concentrating its transmission, and thus its interference to the primary user, in the first transmissions of a primary user packet. The rather simple framework considered in this paper highlights two fundamental aspects of cognitive networks that have not been covered so far: (i) the networking mechanisms implemented by the primary users (error control by means of retransmissions in the considered model) react to secondary users' activity; (ii) if networking mechanisms are considered, then their state must be taken into account when optimizing secondary users' strategy, i.e., a strategy based on a binary active/idle perception of the primary users' state is suboptimal.",

	{'abstract': u'Motivated by providing quality-of-service differentiated services in the Internet, we consider buffer management algorithms for network switches. We study a multi-buffer model. A network switch consists of multiple size-bounded buffers such that at any time, the number of packets residing in each individual buffer cannot exceed its capacity. Packets arrive at the network switch over time; they have values, deadlines, and designated buffers. In each time step, at most one pending packet is allowed to be sent and this packet can be from any buffer. The objective is to maximize the total value of the packets sent by their respective deadlines. A 9.82-competitive online algorithm has been provided for this model (Azar and Levy. SWAT 2006), but no offline algorithms have been known yet. In this paper, We study the offline setting of the multi-buffer model. Our contributions include a few optimal offline algorithms for some variants of the model. Each variant has its unique and interesting algorithmic feature. These offline algorithms help us understand the model better in designing online algorithms.',

	{'abstract': u'Traditional tolerancing considers the conformity of a batch when the batch satisfies the specifications. The characteristic is considered for itself and not according to its incidence in the assembly. Inertial tolerancing proposes another alternative of tolerancing in order to guarantee the final assembly characteristic. The inertia I2 = sqrt is not toleranced by a tolerance interval but by a scalar representing the maximum inertia that the characteristic should not exceed. We detail how to calculate the inertial tolerances according to two cases, one aims to guarantee an inertia of the assembly characteristic the other a tolerance interval on the assembly characteristic by a Cpk capability index, in the particular but common case of uniform tolerances or more general with non uniform tolerances. An example will be detailed to show the results of the different tolerancing methods.',

	{'abstract': u'We present an analytical framework for modeling a priority-based load balancing scheme in cellular networks based on a new algorithm called direct retry with truncated offloading channel resource pool (DR). The model, developed for a baseline case of two cell network, differs in many respects from previous works on load balancing. Foremost, it incorporates the call admission process, through random access. In specific, the proposed model implements the Physical Random Access Channel used in 3GPP network standards. Furthermore, the proposed model allows the differentiation of users based on their priorities. The quantitative results illustrate that, for example, cellular network operators can control the manner in which traffic is offloaded between neighboring cells by simply adjusting the length of the random access phase. Our analysis also allows for the quantitative determination of the blocking probability individual users will experience given a specific length of random access phase. Furthermore, we observe that the improvement in blocking probability per shared channel for load balanced users using DR is maximized at an intermediate number of shared channels, as opposed to the maximum number of these shared resources. This occurs because a balance is achieved between the number of users requesting connections and those that are already admitted to the network. We also present an extension of our analytical model to a multi-cell network (by means of an approximation) and an application of the proposed load balancing scheme in the context of opportunistic spectrum access.',

	{'abstract': u'Dependently typed lambda calculi such as the Logical Framework (LF) can encode relationships between terms in types and can naturally capture correspondences between formulas and their proofs. Such calculi can also be given a logic programming interpretation: the Twelf system is based on such an interpretation of LF. We consider here whether a conventional logic programming language can provide the benefits of a Twelf-like system for encoding type and proof-and-formula dependencies. In particular, we present a simple mapping from LF specifications to a set of formulas in the higher-order hereditary Harrop (hohh) language, that relates derivations and proof-search between the two frameworks. We then show that this encoding can be improved by exploiting knowledge of the well-formedness of the original LF specifications to elide much redundant type-checking information. The resulting logic program has a structure that closely resembles the original specification, thereby allowing LF specifications to be viewed as hohh meta-programs. Using the Teyjus implementation of lambdaProlog, we show that our translation provides an efficient means for executing LF specifications, complementing the ability that the Twelf system provides for reasoning about them.',

	{'abstract': u"This work is a development from the Inetforsmep European project. We proposed to realize a global optimization of a deep drawing industrial progression (made of several stages) for a cup manufacture. The objectives of the process were the thickness decrease and the geometrical parameters (especially the height). This paper improves on this previous work in the aim of mastering the contour error. From the optimal configuration, we expect to cut down the amount of the needed material and the number of forming operations. Our action is focused on the appearance of unexpected undulations (ears) located on the rim of the cups during forming due to a nonuniform crystallographic texture. Those undulations can cause a significant amount of scraps, productivity loss, and cost during manufacture. In this paper, this phenomenon causes the use of four forming operations for the cup manufacture. The aim is to cut down from four to two forming stages by defining an optimal blank (size and shape). The advantage is to reduce the cost of the tool manufacturing and to minimize the needed material (by suppressing the part flange). The chosen approach consists in defining a particular description of the ears' part by modal decomposition and then simulating several blank shapes and sizes generated by discrete cosine transformation (DCT). The use of a numerical simulation for the forming operation and the design of an experiment technique allow mathematical links between the ears' formation and the DCT coefficients. An optimization is then possible by using mathematical links. This original approach leads the ears' amplitude to be reduced by a factor of 10, with only 15 numerical experiments. Moreover, we have limited the number of forming stages from 4 to 2 with a minimal material use.",

We improve the Lieberherr-Specker bound by showing that for each UCF CNF formula with clauses we can find, in polynomial time, a subformula with clauses such that we can simultaneously satisfy at least clauses (in ), where is the number of variables in which are not in .

The former bound is tight for general formulas, and the later is tight for UCF formulas. Mahajan and Raman (J.

We improve this to variables and clauses. Mahajan and Raman conjectured that the second parameterized problem is fixed-parameter tractable (FPT). We show that the problem is indeed FPT by describing a polynomial-time algorithm that transforms any problem instance into an equivalent one with at most variables.

	{'abstract': u'Tolerancing of assembly mechanisms is a major interest in the product life cycle. One can distinguish several models with growing complexity, from 1-dimensional (1D) to 3-dimensional (3D) (including form deviations), and two main tolerancing assumptions, the worst case and the statistical hypothesis. This paper presents an approach to 3D statistical tolerancing using a new acceptance criterion. Our approach is based on the 1D inertial acceptance criterion that is extended to 3D and form acceptance. The modal characterisation is used to describe the form deviation of a geometry as the combination of elementary deviations (location, orientation and form). The proposed 3D statistical tolerancing is applied on a simple mechanism with lever arm. It is also compared to the traditional worst-case tolerancing using a tolerance zone.',

The multilinear tensor-based extension of the biased discriminant analysis (BDA) algorithm, called multilinear biased discriminant analysis (MBDA), is first proposed. Then, we apply the MBDA and two-dimensional BDA (2DBDA) algorithms, as the dimensionality reduction techniques, to Gabor representations and the geometric features of the input image sequence respectively. The proposed scheme can deal with the asymmetry between positive and negative samples as well as curse of dimensionality dilemma. Extensive experiments on Cohn-Kanade database show the superiority of the proposed method for representation of the subtle changes and the temporal information involved in formation of the facial expressions. As an accurate tool, this representation can be applied to many areas such as recognition of spontaneous and deliberate facial expressions, multi modal/media human computer interaction and lie detection efforts.',

	{'abstract': u'Facial Action Coding System consists of 44 action units (AUs) and more than 7000 combinations. Hidden Markov models (HMMs) classifier has been used successfully to recognize facial action units (AUs) and expressions due to its ability to deal with AU dynamics. However, a separate HMM is necessary for each single AU and each AU combination. Since combinations of AU numbering in thousands, a more efficient method will be needed. In this paper an accurate real-time sequence-based system for representation and recognition of facial AUs is presented. Our system has the following characteristics: 1) employing a mixture of HMMs and neural network, we develop a novel accurate classifier, which can deal with AU dynamics, recognize subtle changes, and it is also robust to intensity variations, 2) although we use an HMM for each single AU only, by employing a neural network we can recognize each single and combination AU, and 3) using both geometric and appearance-based features, and applying efficient dimension reduction techniques, our system is robust to illumination changes and it can represent the temporal information involved in formation of the facial expressions. Extensive experiments on Cohn-Kanade database show the superiority of the proposed method, in comparison with other classifiers.

	{'abstract': u"We develop a probabilistic framework for global modeling of the traffic over a computer network. This model integrates existing single-link (-flow) traffic models with the routing over the network to capture the global traffic behavior. It arises from a limit approximation of the traffic fluctuations as the time--scale and the number of users sharing the network grow. The resulting probability model is comprised of a Gaussian and/or a stable, infinite variance components. They can be succinctly described and handled by certain 'space-time' random fields. The model is validated against simulated and real data. It is then applied to predict traffic fluctuations over unobserved links from a limited set of observed links. Further, applications to anomaly detection and network management are briefly discussed.",

	{'abstract': u"This paper extends the analogies employed in the development of quantum-inspired evolutionary algorithms by proposing quantum-inspired Hadamard walks, called QHW. A novel quantum-inspired evolutionary algorithm, called HQEA, for solving combinatorial optimization problems, is also proposed. The novelty of HQEA lies in it's incorporation of QHW Remote Search and QHW Local Search - the quantum equivalents of classical mutation and local search, that this paper defines. The intuitive reasoning behind this approach, and the exploration-exploitation balance thus occurring is explained. From the results of the experiments carried out on the 0,1-knapsack problem, HQEA performs significantly better than a conventional genetic algorithm, CGA, and two quantum-inspired evolutionary algorithms - QEA and NQEA, in terms of convergence speed and accuracy.",

	{'abstract': u"We consider a dense n-user Gaussian interference network formed by paired transmitters and receivers placed independently at random in Euclidean space. Under natural conditions on the node position distributions and signal attenuation, we prove convergence in probability of the average per-user capacity C_Sigma/n to 1/2 E log(1 + 2SNR). The achievability result follows directly from results based on an interference alignment scheme presented in recent work of Nazer et al. Our main contribution comes through the converse result, motivated by ideas of `bottleneck links' developed in recent work of Jafar. An information theoretic argument gives a capacity bound on such bottleneck links, and probabilistic counting arguments show there are sufficiently many such links to tightly bound the sum-capacity of the whole network.",

	{'abstract': u'In this paper an accurate real-time sequence-based system for representation, recognition, interpretation, and analysis of the facial action units (AUs) and expressions is presented. Our system has the following characteristics: 1) employing adaptive-network-based fuzzy inference systems (ANFIS) and temporal information, we developed a classification scheme based on neuro-fuzzy modeling of the AU intensity, which is robust to intensity variations, 2) using both geometric and appearance-based features, and applying efficient dimension reduction techniques, our system is robust to illumination changes and it can represent the subtle changes as well as temporal information involved in formation of the facial expressions, and 3) by continuous values of intensity and employing top-down hierarchical rule-based classifiers, we can develop accurate human-interpretable AU-to-expression converters. Extensive experiments on Cohn-Kanade database show the superiority of the proposed method, in comparison with support vector machines, hidden Markov models, and neural network classifiers.

	{'abstract': u"Cross-document coreference, the problem of resolving entity mentions across multi-document collections, is crucial to automated knowledge base construction and data mining tasks. However, the scarcity of large labeled data sets has hindered supervised machine learning research for this task. In this paper we develop and demonstrate an approach based on ``distantly-labeling'' a data set from which we can train a discriminative cross-document coreference model. In particular we build a dataset of more than a million people mentions extracted from 3.5 years of New York Times articles, leverage Wikipedia for distant labeling with a generative model (and measure the reliability of such labeling); then we train and evaluate a conditional random field coreference model that has factors on cross-document entities as well as mention-pairs. This coreference model obtains high accuracy in resolving mentions and entities that are not present in the training data, indicating applicability to non-Wikipedia data. Given the large amount of data, our work is also an exercise demonstrating the scalability of our approach.",

	{'abstract': u'In this paper, we suggest a novel data hiding technique in an HTML Web page. HTML Tags are case insensitive and hence an alphabet in lowercase and one in uppercase present inside an HTML tag are interpreted in the same manner by the browser,i.e., change in case in an web page is imperceptible to the browser. We basically exploit this redundancy and use it to embed secret data inside an web page, with no changes visible to the user of the web page, so that he can not even suspect about the data hiding. The embedded data can be recovered by viewing the source of the HTML page. This technique can easily be extended to embed secret message inside any piece of source-code where the standard interpreter of that language is case-insensitive.',

	{'abstract': u'Segmentation of images holds an important position in the area of image processing. It becomes more important whi le typically dealing with medical images where presurgery and post surgery decisions are required for the purpose of initiating and speeding up the recovery process. Segmentation of 3-D tumor structures from magnetic resonance images (MRI) is a very challenging problem due to the variability of tumor geometry and intensity patterns. Level set evolution combining global smoothness with the flexibility of topology changes offers significant advantages over the conventional statistical classification followed by mathematical morphology. Level set evolution with constant propagation needs to be initialized either completely inside or outside the tumor and can leak through weak or missing boundary parts. Replacing the constant propagation term by a statistical force overcomes these limitations and results in a convergence to a stable solution. Using MR images presenting tumors, probabilities for background and tumor regions are calculated from a pre- and post-contrast difference image and mixture modeling fit of the histogram. The whole image is used for initialization of the level set evolution to segment the tumor boundaries.',

	{'abstract': u'The tolerancing process links the virtual and the real worlds. From the former, tolerances define a variational geometrical language (geometric parameters). From the latter, there are values limiting those parameters. The beginning of a tolerancing process is in this duality. As high precision assemblies cannot be analyzed with the assumption that form errors are negligible, we propose to apply this process to assemblies with form errors through a new way of allowing to parameterize forms and solve their assemblies. The assembly process is calculated through a method of allowing to solve the 3D assemblies of pairs of surfaces having form errors using a static equilibrium. We have built a geometrical model based on the modal shapes of the ideal surface. We compute for the completely deterministic contact points between this pair of shapes according to a given assembly process. The solution gives an accurate evaluation of the assembly performance. Then we compare the results with or without taking into account the form errors. When we analyze a batch of assemblies, the problem is to compute for the nonconformity rate of a pilot production according to the functional requirements. We input probable errors of surfaces (position, orientation, and form) in our calculus and we evaluate the quality of the results compared with the functional requirements. The pilot production then can or cannot be validated.',

	{'abstract': u'The parity decision tree model extends the decision tree model by allowing the computation of a parity function in one step. We prove that the deterministic parity decision tree complexity of any Boolean function is polynomially related to the non-deterministic complexity of the function or its complement. We also show that they are polynomially related to an analogue of the block sensitivity. We further study parity decision trees in their relations with an intermediate variant of the decision trees, as well as with communication complexity.',

	{'abstract': u'In the last two decades, a number of methods have been proposed for forecasting based on fuzzy time series. Most of the fuzzy time series methods are presented for forecasting of car road accidents. However, the forecasting accuracy rates of the existing methods are not good enough. In this paper, we compared our proposed new method of fuzzy time series forecasting with existing methods. Our method is based on means based partitioning of the historical data of car road accidents. The proposed method belongs to the kth order and time-variant methods. The proposed method can get the best forecasting accuracy rate for forecasting the car road accidents than the existing methods.',

	{'abstract': u'For the most of my life, I have earned my living as a computer vision professional busy with image processing tasks and problems. In the computer vision community there is a widespread belief that artificial vision systems faithfully replicate human vision abilities or at least very closely mimic them. It was a great surprise to me when one day I have realized that computer and human vision have next to nothing in common. The former is occupied with extensive data processing, carrying out massive pixel-based calculations, while the latter is busy with meaningful information processing, concerned with smart objects-based manipulations. And the gap between the two is insurmountable. To resolve this confusion, I had had to return and revaluate first the vision phenomenon itself, define more carefully what visual information is and how to treat it properly. In this work I have not been, as it is usually accepted, biologically inspired . On the contrary, I have drawn my inspirations from a pure mathematical theory, the Kolmogorov s complexity theory. The results of my work have been already published elsewhere. So the objective of this paper is to try and apply the insights gained in course of this my enterprise to a more general case of information processing in human brain and the challenging issue of human intelligence.',

	{'abstract': u'Two-ray ground reflection model has been widely used as the propagation model to investigate the performance of an ad hoc network. But two-ray model is too simple to represent a real world network. A more realistic model namely shadowing propagation model has been used in this investigation. Under shadowing propagation model, a mobile node may receive a packet at a signal level that is below a required threshold level. This low signal level affects the routing protocol as well as the medium access control protocol of a network. An analytical model has been presented in this paper to investigate the shadowing effects on the network performance. The analytical model has been verified via simulation results. Simulation results show that the performance of a network becomes very poor if shadowing propagation model is used in compare to the simple two-ray model. Two solutions have also been proposed in this paper to overcome the effects of shadowing. One solution is a physical layer solution and the other one is a Medium Access Control (MAC) layer solution. Simulation results show that these two solutions reduce the shadowing effect and improve network performance.',

To provide an indication various implementations are studied and summarized to identify the different problems in existing applications. Clustering time series is a trouble that has applications in an extensive assortment of fields and has recently attracted a large amount of research. Time series data are frequently large and may contain outliers. In addition, time series are a special type of data set where elements have a temporal ordering. Therefore clustering of such data stream is an important issue in the data mining process. Numerous techniques and clustering algorithms have been proposed earlier to assist clustering of time series data streams. The clustering algorithms and its effectiveness on various applications are compared to develop a new method to solve the existing problem. This paper presents a survey on various clustering algorithms available for time series datasets. Moreover, the distinctiveness and restriction of previous research are discussed and several achievable topics for future study are recognized. Furthermore the areas that utilize time series clustering are also summarized.",

	{'abstract': u'A wireless sensor network consists of light-weight, low power, small size sensor nodes. Routing in wireless sensor networks is a demanding task. This demand has led to a number of routing protocols which efficiently utilize the limited resources available at the sensor nodes. Most of these protocols are either based on single hop routing or multi hop routing and typically find the minimum energy path without addressing other issues such as time delay in delivering a packet, load balancing, and redundancy of data. Response time is very critical in environment monitoring sensor networks where typically the sensors are stationary and transmit data to a base station or a sink node. In this paper a faster load balancing routing protocol based on location with a hybrid approach is proposed.',

	{'abstract': u'Admission control schemes and scheduling algorithms are designed to offer QoS services in 802.16/802.16e networks and a number of studies have investigated these issues. But the channel condition and priority of traffic classes are very rarely considered in the existing scheduling algorithms. Although a number of energy saving mechanisms have been proposed for the IEEE 802.16e, to minimize the power consumption of IEEE 802.16e mobile stations with multiple real-time connections has not yet been investigated. Moreover, they mainly consider non real- time connections in IEEE 802.16e networks. In this paper, we propose to design an adaptive power efficient packet scheduling algorithm that provides a minimum fair allocation of the channel bandwidth for each packet flow and additionally minimizes the power consumption. In the adaptive scheduling algorithm, packets are transmitted as per allotted slots from different priority of traffic classes adaptively, depending on the channel condition. Suppose if the buffer size of the high priority traffic queues with bad channel condition exceeds a threshold, then the priority of those flows will be increased by adjusting the sleep duty cycle of existing low priority traffic, to prevent the starvation. By simulation results, we show that our proposed scheduler achieves better channel utilization while minimizing the delay and power consumption.',

	{'abstract': u"Bit arrays, or bitmaps, are used to significantly speed up set operations in several areas, such as data warehousing, information retrieval, and data mining, to cite a few. However, bitmaps usually use a large storage space, thus requiring compression. Nevertheless, there is a space-time tradeoff among compression schemes. The Word Aligned Hybrid (WAH) bitmap compression trades some space to allow for bitwise operations without first decompressing bitmaps. WAH has been recognized as the most efficient scheme in terms of computation time. In this paper we present CONCISE (Compressed 'n' Composable Integer Set), a new scheme that enjoys significatively better performances than those of WAH. In particular, when compared to WAH, our algorithm is able to reduce the required memory up to 50%, by having similar or better performance in terms of computation time. Further, we show that CONCISE can be efficiently used to manipulate bitmaps representing sets of integral numbers in lieu of well-known data structures such as arrays, lists, hashtables, and self-balancing binary search trees. Extensive experiments over synthetic data show the effectiveness of our approach.",

	{'abstract': u"The digital image data is rapidly expanding in quantity and heterogeneity. The traditional information retrieval techniques does not meet the user's demand, so there is need to develop an efficient system for content based image retrieval. Content based image retrieval means retrieval of images from database on the basis of visual features of image like as color, texture etc. In our proposed method feature are extracted after applying Phong shading on input image. Phong shading, flattering out the dull surfaces of the image The features are extracted using color, texture &amp; edge density methods. Feature extracted values are used to find the similarity between input query image and the data base image. It can be measure by the Euclidean distance formula. The experimental result shows that the proposed approach has a better retrieval results with phong shading.",

Our main contribution is a sound methodto combine our previous optimal method for tracking least fix-points in PDL with our previous optimal method for handling converse in the description logic ALCI. The extension is non-trivial as the two methods cannot be combined naively. We give sufficient details to enable an implementation by others.

	{'abstract': u'It is well known that minimization can be used to recover sufficiently sparse unknown signals from compressed linear measurements. In fact, exact thresholds on the sparsity, as a function of the ratio between the system dimensions, so that with high probability almost all sparse signals can be recovered from iid Gaussian measurements, have been computed and are referred to as "weak thresholds" cite. In this paper, we introduce a reweighted recovery algorithm composed of two steps: a standard minimization step to identify a set of entries where the signal is likely to reside, and a weighted minimization step where entries outside this set are penalized. For signals where the non-sparse component has iid Gaussian entries, we prove a "strict" improvement in the weak recovery threshold. Simulations suggest that the improvement can be quite impressive-over 20% in the example we consider.',

	{'abstract': u'This paper describes the use of fuzzy logic controller for efficiency optimization control of a drive while keeping good dynamic response. At steady-state light-load condition, the fuzzy controller adaptively adjusts the excitation current with respect to the torque current to give the minimum total copper and iron loss. The measured input power such that, for a given load torque and speed, the drive settles down to the minimum input power, i.e., operates at maximum efficiency. The low-frequency pulsating torque due to decrementation of flux is compensated in a feed forward manner. If the load torque or speed commands changes, the efficiency search algorithm is abandoned and the rated flux is established to get the best dynamic response. The drive system with the proposed efficiency optimization controller has been simulated with lossy models of converter and machine, and its performance has been thoroughly investigated.',

This network is constructed by introducing random shortcuts in a nearest-neighbors ring. The local stability of the synchronous state is closely related with the support of the eigenvalue distribution of the Laplacian matrix of the network. We introduce, for the first time, analytical expressions for the first three moments of the eigenvalue distribution of the Laplacian matrix as a function of the probability of shortcuts and the connectivity of the underlying nearest-neighbor coupled ring. We apply these expressions to estimate the spectral support of the Laplacian matrix in order to predict synchronization in small-world networks.

	{'abstract': u"Peer-to-peer swarming is one of the emph solutions for distributed content dissemination in today's Internet. By leveraging resources provided by clients, swarming systems reduce the load on and costs to publishers. However, there is a limit to how much cost savings can be gained from swarming; for example, for unpopular content peers will always depend on the publisher in order to complete their downloads. In this paper, we investigate this dependence. For this purpose, we propose a new metric, namely emph. A swarm is referred to as self-sustaining if all its blocks are collectively held by peers; the self-sustainability of a swarm is the fraction of time in which the swarm is self-sustaining. We pose the following question: how does the self-sustainability of a swarm vary as a function of content popularity, the service capacity of the users, and the size of the file? We present a model to answer the posed question. We then propose efficient solution methods to compute self-sustainability. The accuracy of our estimates is validated against simulation. Finally, we also provide closed-form expressions for the fraction of time that a given number of blocks is collectively held by peers.",

However, the number of vertices for sums of more polytopes was unknown so far. In this paper, we study sums of polytopes in general orientations, and show a linear relation between the number of faces of a sum of polytopes in dimension , with , and the number of faces in the sums of less than of the summand polytopes. We deduce from this exact formula a tight bound on the maximum possible number of vertices of the Minkowski sum of any number of polytopes in any dimension. In particular, the linear relation implies that a sum of polytopes in dimension has a number of vertices in of the total number of vertices in the summands, even when .

These criteria reduce the projection problem to a certain modification of the equivalence problem of planar curves under affine and projective transformations. The latter problem can be addressed using Cartan's moving frame method. This leads to a novel algorithmic solution of the projection problem for curves. The computational advantage of the algorithms presented here, in comparison to algorithms based on a straightforward solution, lies in a significant reduction of a number of real parameters that has to be eliminated in order to establish existence or non-existence of a projection that maps a given spatial curve to a given planar curve. The same approach can be used to decide whether a given finite set of ordered points on a plane is an image of a given finite set of ordered points in R^3. The motivation comes from the problem of establishing a correspondence between an object and an image, taken by a camera with unknown position and parameters.",

	{'abstract': u'Dynamic allocation of resources to the emph link in large multiuser networks offers considerable improvement in spectral efficiency. This gain, often referred to as emph, can be cast as double-logarithmic growth of the network throughput with the number of users. In this paper we consider large cognitive networks granted concurrent spectrum access with license-holding users. The primary network affords to share its under-utilized spectrum bands with the secondary users. We assess the optimal multiuser diversity gain in the cognitive networks by quantifying how the sum-rate throughput of the network scales with the number of secondary users. For this purpose we look at the optimal pairing of spectrum bands and secondary users, which is supervised by a central entity fully aware of the instantaneous channel conditions, and show that the throughput of the cognitive network scales double-logarithmically with the number of secondary users () and linearly with the number of available spectrum bands (), i.e., . We then propose a emph spectrum allocation scheme, which does not necessitate a central controller or any information exchange between different secondary users and still obeys the optimal throughput scaling law. This scheme requires that emph secondary transmitter-receiver pairs exchange information bits among themselves. We also show that the aggregate amount of information exchange between secondary transmitter-receiver pairs is equal to . Finally, we show that our distributed scheme guarantees fairness among the secondary users, meaning that they are equally likely to get access to an available spectrum band.',

	{'abstract': u'We study the problem of identity testing for depth-3 circuits of top fanin k and degree d. We give a new structure theorem for such identities. A direct application of our theorem improves the known deterministic d^-time black-box identity test over rationals (Kayal-Saraf, FOCS 2009) to one that takes d^-time. Our structure theorem essentially says that the number of independent variables in a real depth-3 identity is very small. This theorem settles affirmatively the stronger rank conjectures posed by Dvir-Shpilka (STOC 2005) and Kayal-Saraf (FOCS 2009). Our techniques provide a unified framework that actually beats all known rank bounds and hence gives the best running time (for every field) for black-box identity tests. Our main theorem (almost optimally) pins down the relation between higher dimensional Sylvester-Gallai theorems and the rank of depth-3 identities in a very transparent manner. The existence of this was hinted at by Dvir-Shpilka (STOC 2005), but first proven, for reals, by Kayal-Saraf (FOCS 2009). We introduce the concept of Sylvester-Gallai rank bounds for any field, and show the intimate connection between this and depth-3 identity rank bounds. We also prove the first ever theorem about high dimensional Sylvester-Gallai configurations over any field. Our proofs and techniques are very different from previous results and devise a very interesting ensemble of combinatorics and algebra. The latter concepts are ideal theoretic and involve a new Chinese remainder theorem. Our proof methods explain the structure of any depth-3 identity C: there is a nucleus of C that forms a low rank identity, while the remainder is a high dimensional Sylvester-Gallai configuration.',

	{'abstract': u'The paper presents the gossip interactive Kalman filter (GIKF) for distributed Kalman filtering for networked systems and sensor networks, where inter-sensor communication and observations occur at the same time-scale. The communication among sensors is random; each sensor occasionally exchanges its filtering state information with a neighbor depending on the availability of the appropriate network link. We show that under a weak distributed detectability condition: 1. the GIKF error process remains stochastically bounded, irrespective of the instability properties of the random process dynamics; and 2. the network achieves emph, i.e., the conditional estimation error covariance at a (uniformly) randomly selected sensor converges in distribution to a unique invariant measure on the space of positive semi-definite matrices (independent of the initial state.) To prove these results, we interpret the filtered states (estimates and error covariances) at each node in the GIKF as stochastic particles with local interactions. We analyze the asymptotic properties of the error process by studying as a random dynamical system the associated switched (random) Riccati equation, the switching being dictated by a non-stationary Markov chain on the network graph.',

	{'abstract': u'Very recently, Hartline and Lucier studied single-parameter mechanism design problems in the Bayesian setting. They proposed a black-box reduction that converted Bayesian approximation algorithms into Bayesian-Incentive-Compatible (BIC) mechanisms while preserving social welfare. It remains a major open question if one can find similar reduction in the more important multi-parameter setting. In this paper, we give positive answer to this question when the prior distribution has finite and small support. We propose a black-box reduction for designing BIC multi-parameter mechanisms. The reduction converts any algorithm into an eps-BIC mechanism with only marginal loss in social welfare. As a result, for combinatorial auctions with sub-additive agents we get an eps-BIC mechanism that achieves constant approximation.',

	{'abstract': u'This paper studies the problem of identification and extraction of flat and nested data records from a given web page. With the explosive growth of information sources available on the World Wide Web, it has become increasingly difficult to identify the relevant pieces of information, since web pages are often cluttered with irrelevant content like advertisements, navigation-panels, copyright notices etc., surrounding the main content of the web page. Hence, it is useful to mine such data regions and data records in order to extract information from such web pages to provide value-added services. Currently available automatic techniques to mine data regions and data records from web pages are still unsatisfactory because of their poor performance. In this paper a novel method to identify and extract the flat and nested data records from the web pages automatically is proposed. It comprises of two steps : (1) Identification and Extraction of the data regions based on visual clues information. (2) Identification and extraction of flat and nested data records from the data region of a web page automatically. For step1, a novel and more effective method is proposed, which finds the data regions formed by all types of tags using visual clues. For step2, a more effective and efficient method namely, Visual Clue based Extraction of web Data (VCED), is proposed, which extracts each record from the data region and identifies it whether it is a flat or nested data record based on visual clue information the area covered by and the number of data items present in each record. Our experimental results show that the proposed technique is effective and better than existing techniques.',

	{'abstract': u'In this paper, a novel method for representation and recognition of the facial expressions in two-dimensional image sequences is presented. We apply a variation of two-dimensional heteroscedastic linear discriminant analysis (2DHLDA) algorithm, as an efficient dimensionality reduction technique, to Gabor representation of the input sequence. 2DHLDA is an extension of the two-dimensional linear discriminant analysis (2DLDA) approach and it removes the equal within-class covariance. By applying 2DHLDA in two directions, we eliminate the correlations between both image columns and image rows. Then, we perform a one-dimensional LDA on the new features. This combined method can alleviate the small sample size problem and instability encountered by HLDA. Also, employing both geometric and appearance features and using an ensemble learning scheme based on data fusion, we create a classifier which can efficiently classify the facial expressions. The proposed method is robust to illumination changes and it can properly represent temporal information as well as subtle changes in facial muscles. We provide experiments on Cohn-Kanade database that show the superiority of the proposed method.

The results of the experiments are not meant to give an indication of the performance of a solver, but rather investigate what influence the choice of algorithms and data structures has. The analysis of the impact of the design decisions focuses on the different ways of memory management, behaviour with increasing problem size, and specialised algorithms for specific types of variables.

	{'abstract': u'Several new applications and a number of new mathematical techniques have increased the research on error-correcting codes in the Lee metric in the last decade. In this work we consider several coding problems and constructions of error-correcting codes in the Lee metric. First, we consider constructions of dense error-correcting codes in relatively small dimensions over small alphabets. The second problem we solve is construction of diametric perfect codes with minimum distance four. We will construct such codes over various lengths and alphabet sizes. The third problem is to transfer an n-dimensional Lee sphere with large radius into a shape, with the same volume, located in a relatively small box. Hadamard matrices play an essential role in the solutions for all three problems. A construction of codes based on Hadamard matrices will start our discussion. These codes approach the sphere packing bound for very high rate range and appear to be the best known codes over some sets of parameters.',

	{'abstract': u'Regenerating codes are a class of distributed storage codes that optimally trade the bandwidth needed for repair of a failed node with the amount of data stored per node of the network. Minimum Storage Regenerating (MSR) codes minimize first, the amount of data stored per node, and then the repair bandwidth, while Minimum Bandwidth Regenerating (MBR) codes carry out the minimization in the reverse order. An [n, k, d] regenerating code permits the data to be recovered by connecting to any k of the n nodes in the network, while requiring that repair of a failed node be made possible by connecting (using links of lesser capacity) to any d nodes. Previous, explicit and general constructions of exact-regenerating codes have been confined to the case n=d+1. In this paper, we present optimal, explicit constructions of MBR codes for all feasible values of [n, k, d] and MSR codes for all [n, k, d &gt;= 2k-2], using a product-matrix framework. The particular product-matrix nature of the constructions is shown to significantly simplify system operation. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first constructions of exact-regenerating codes that allow the number n of nodes in the distributed storage network, to be chosen independent of the other parameters. The paper also contains a simpler description, in the product-matrix framework, of a previously constructed MSR code in which the parameter d satisfies [n=d+1, k, d &gt;= 2k-1].',

	{'abstract': u'A local algorithm is a distributed algorithm that completes after a constant number of synchronous communication rounds. We present local approximation algorithms for the minimum dominating set problem and the maximum matching problem in 2-coloured and weakly 2-coloured graphs. In a weakly 2-coloured graph, both problems admit a local algorithm with the approximation factor , where is the maximum degree of the graph. We also give a matching lower bound proving that there is no local algorithm with a better approximation factor for either of these problems. Furthermore, we show that the stronger assumption of a 2-colouring does not help in the case of the dominating set problem, but there is a local approximation scheme for the maximum matching problem in 2-coloured graphs.',

	{'abstract': u'We consider the problem of constructing a single spanning tree for the single-source buy-at-bulk network design problem for doubling-dimension graphs. We compute a spanning tree to route a set of demands (or data) along a graph to or from a designated root node. The demands could be aggregated at (or symmetrically distributed to) intermediate nodes where the fusion-cost is specified by a non-negative concave function . We describe a novel approach for developing an oblivious spanning tree in the sense that it is independent of the number of data sources (or demands) and cost function at intermediate nodes. To our knowledge, this is the first paper to propose a single spanning tree solution to this problem (as opposed to multiple overlay trees). There has been no prior work where the tree is oblivious to both the fusion cost function and the set of sources (demands). We present a deterministic, polynomial-time algorithm for constructing a spanning tree in low doubling graphs that guarantees -approximation over the optimal cost, where is the diameter of the graph and the total number of nodes. With constant fusion-cost function our spanning tree gives a -approximation for every Steiner tree to the root.',

	{'abstract': u'An important problem in computational social choice theory is the complexity of undesirable behavior among agents, such as control, manipulation, and bribery in election systems. These kinds of voting strategies are often tempting at the individual level but disastrous for the agents as a whole. Creating election systems where the determination of such strategies is difficult is thus an important goal. An interesting set of elections is that of scoring protocols. Previous work in this area has demonstrated the complexity of misuse in cases involving a fixed number of candidates, and of specific election systems on unbounded number of candidates such as Borda. In contrast, we take the first step in generalizing the results of computational complexity of election misuse to cases of infinitely many scoring protocols on an unbounded number of candidates. Interesting families of systems include -approval and -veto elections, in which voters distinguish candidates from the candidate set. Our main result is to partition the problems of these families based on their complexity. We do so by showing they are polynomial-time computable, NP-hard, or polynomial-time equivalent to another problem of interest. We also demonstrate a surprising connection between manipulation in election systems and some graph theory problems.',

	{'abstract': u'In a bi-directional relay channel, a pair of nodes wish to exchange independent messages over a shared wireless half-duplex channel with the help of relays. Recent work has mostly considered information theoretic limits of the bi-directional relay channel with two terminal nodes (or end users) and one relay. In this work we consider bi-directional relaying with one base station, multiple terminal nodes and one relay, all of which operate in half-duplex modes. We assume that each terminal node communicates with the base-station in a bi-directional fashion through the relay and do not place any restrictions on the channels between the users, relays and base-stations; that is, each node has a direct link with every other node. Our contributions are three-fold: 1) the introduction of four new temporal protocols which fully exploit the two-way nature of the data and outperform simple routing or multi-hop communication schemes by carefully combining network coding, random binning and user cooperation which exploit over-heard and own-message side information, 2) derivations of inner and outer bounds on the capacity region of the discrete-memoryless multi-pair two-way network, and 3) a numerical evaluation of the obtained achievable rate regions and outer bounds in Gaussian noise which illustrate the performance of the proposed protocols compared to simpler schemes, to each other, to the outer bounds, which highlight the relative gains achieved by network coding, random binning and compress-and-forward-type cooperation between terminal nodes.',

	{'abstract': u'This paper addresses network code design for robust transmission of sources over an orthogonal two-hop wireless network with a broadcasting relay. The network consists of multiple sources and destinations in which each destination, benefiting the relay signal, intends to decode a subset of the sources. Two special instances of this network are orthogonal broadcast relay channel and the orthogonal multiple access relay channel. The focus is on complexity constrained scenarios, e.g., for wireless sensor networks, where channel coding is practically imperfect. Taking a source-channel and network coding approach, we design the network code (mapping) at the relay such that the average reconstruction distortion at the destinations is minimized. To this end, by decomposing the distortion into its components, an efficient design algorithm is proposed. The resulting network code is nonlinear and substantially outperforms the best performing linear network code. A motivating formulation of a family of structured nonlinear network codes is also presented. Numerical results and comparison with linear network coding at the relay and the corresponding distortion-power bound demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed schemes and a promising research direction.',

	{'abstract': u'Agile Methods are designed for customization; they offer an organization or a team the flexibility to adopt a set of principles and practices based on their culture and values. While that flexibility is consistent with the agile philosophy, it can lead to the adoption of principles and practices that can be sub-optimal relative to the desired objectives. We question then, how can one determine if adopted practices are "in sync" with the identified principles, and to what extent those principles support organizational objectives? In this research, we focus on assessing the "goodness" of an agile method adopted by an organization based on (1) its adequacy, (2) the capability of the organization to provide the supporting environment to competently implement the method, and (3) its effectiveness. To guide our assessment, we propose the Objectives, Principles and Practices (OPP) framework. The design of the OPP framework revolves around the identification of the agile objectives, principles that support the achievement of those objectives, and practices that reflect the "spirit" of those principles. Well-defined linkages between the objectives and principles, and between the principles and practices are also established to support the assessment process. We traverse these linkages in a top-down fashion to assess adequacy and a bottom-up fashion to assess capability and effectiveness. This is a work-in-progress paper, outlining our proposed research, preliminary results and future directions.',

	{'abstract': u'The area of networking games has had a growing impact on wireless networks. This reflects the recognition in the important scaling advantages that the service providers can benefit from by increasing the autonomy of mobiles in decision making. This may however result in inefficiencies that are inherent to equilibria in non-cooperative games. Due to the concern for efficiency, centralized protocols keep being considered and compared to decentralized ones. From the point of view of the network architecture, this implies the co-existence of network-centric and terminal centric radio resource management schemes. Instead of taking part within the debate among the supporters of each solution, we propose in this paper hybrid schemes where the wireless users are assisted in their decisions by the network that broadcasts aggregated load information. We derive the utilities related to the Quality of Service (QoS) perceived by the users and develop a Bayesian framework to obtain the equilibria. Numerical results illustrate the advantages of using our hybrid game framework in an association problem in a network composed of HSDPA and 3G LTE systems.',

	{'abstract': u"In this paper we introduce a new method called alpha-Discounting Multi-Criteria Decision Making ( alpha-D MCDM), which is an aletrnative and extension of Saaty's Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP). It works for any set of preferences that can be transformed into a system of homogeneous linear equations. A degree of consistency (and implicitly a degree of inconsistency) of a decision-making problem are defined. alpha-D MCDM is then generalized to a set of preferences that can be transformed into a system of linear and/or non-linear equations and/or inequalities. Many consistent, weak inconsistent, and strong inconsistent examples are given.",

	{'abstract': u"Providing security guarantees for wireless communication is critically important for today's applications. While previous work in this area has concentrated on radio frequency (RF) channels, providing security guarantees for RF channels is inherently difficult because they are prone to rapid variations due small scale fading. Wireless optical communication, on the other hand, is inherently more secure than RF communication due to the intrinsic aspects of the signal propagation in the optical and near-optical frequency range. In this paper, secure communication over wireless optical links is examined by studying the secrecy capacity of a direct detection system. For the degraded Poisson wiretap channel, a closed-form expression of the secrecy capacity is given. A complete characterization of the general rate-equivocation region is also presented. For achievability, an optimal code is explicitly constructed by using the structured code designed by Wyner for the Poisson channel. The converse is proved in two different ways: the first method relies only on simple properties of the conditional expectation and basic information theoretical inequalities, whereas the second method hinges on the recent link established between minimum mean square estimation and mutual information in Poisson channels.",

	{'abstract': u"The ability to efficiently and accurately detect objects plays a very crucial role for many computer vision tasks. Recently, offline object detectors have shown a tremendous success. However, one major drawback of offline techniques is that a complete set of training data has to be collected beforehand. In addition, once learned, an offline detector can not make use of newly arriving data. To alleviate these drawbacks, online learning has been adopted with the following objectives: (1) the technique should be computationally and storage efficient; (2) the updated classifier must maintain its high classification accuracy. In this paper, we propose an effective and efficient framework for learning an adaptive online greedy sparse linear discriminant analysis (GSLDA) model. Unlike many existing online boosting detectors, which usually apply exponential or logistic loss, our online algorithm makes use of LDA's learning criterion that not only aims to maximize the class-separation criterion but also incorporates the asymmetrical property of training data distributions. We provide a better alternative for online boosting algorithms in the context of training a visual object detector. We demonstrate the robustness and efficiency of our methods on handwriting digit and face data sets. Our results confirm that object detection tasks benefit significantly when trained in an online manner.",

	{'abstract': u"Since J. Mitola's work in 1992, Software Defined Radios (SDRs) have been quite a hot topic in wireless systems research. Though many notable achievements were reported in the field, the scarcity of computational power on general purpose CPUs has always constrained their wide adoption in production environments. If conveniently applied within an SDR context, classical concepts known in computer science as space/time tradeoffs can be extremely helpful when trying to mitigate this problem. Inspired by and building on those concepts, this paper presents a novel SDR implementation technique which we call Memory Acceleration (MA) that makes extensive use of the memory resources available on a general purpose computing system, in order to accelerate signal computation. MA can provide substantial acceleration factors when applied to conventional SDRs without reducing their peculiar flexibility. As a practical proof of this, an example of MA applied in the real world to the ETSI DVB-T Viterbi decoder is provided. Actually MA is shown able to provide, when applied to such Viterbi decoder, an acceleration factor of 10.4x, with no impact on error correction performances of the decoder and by making no use of any other typical performance enhancement techniques such as low level (Assembler) programming or parallel computation, which though remain compatible with MA. Opportunity for extending the MA approach to the entire radio system, thus implementing what we call a Memory-Based Software Defined Radio (MB-SDR) is finally considered and discussed.",

	{'abstract': u'Electoral control models ways of changing the outcome of an election via such actions as adding/deleting/partitioning either candidates or voters. These actions modify an election\'s participation structure and aim at either making a favorite candidate win ("constructive control") or prevent a despised candidate from winning ("destructive control"), which yields a total of 22 standard control scenarios. To protect elections from such control attempts, computational complexity has been used to show that electoral control, though not impossible, is computationally prohibitive. Among natural voting systems with a polynomial-time winner problem, the two systems with the highest number of proven resistances to control types (namely 19 out of 22) are "sincere-strategy preference-based approval voting" (SP-AV, a modification of a system proposed by Brams and Sanver) and fallback voting. Both are hybrid systems; e.g., fallback voting combines approval with Bucklin voting. In this paper, we study the control complexity of Bucklin voting itself and show that it behaves equally well in terms of control resistance for the 20 cases investigated so far. As Bucklin voting is a special case of fallback voting, all resistances shown for Bucklin voting in this paper strengthen the corresponding resistance for fallback voting.',

For this study, a gaze interaction Half-Life 2 game modification was created that allowed eye tracking control. The mod was deployed during an experiment at Dreamhack 2007, where participants had to play with gaze navigation and afterwards rate their gameplay experience. The results show low tension and negative affects scores on the gameplay experience questionnaire as well as high positive challenge, immersion and flow ratings. The correlation between spatial presence and immersion for gaze interaction was high and yields further investigation. It is concluded that gameplay experience can be correctly assessed with the methodology presented in this paper.',

	{'abstract': u'Object detection is one of the key tasks in computer vision. The cascade framework of Viola and Jones has become the de facto standard. A classifier in each node of the cascade is required to achieve extremely high detection rates, instead of low overall classification error. Although there are a few reported methods addressing this requirement in the context of object detection, there is no a principled feature selection method that explicitly takes into account this asymmetric node learning objective. We provide such a boosting algorithm in this work. It is inspired by the linear asymmetric classifier (LAC) of Wu et al. in that our boosting algorithm optimizes a similar cost function. The new totally-corrective boosting algorithm is implemented by the column generation technique in convex optimization. Experimental results on face detection suggest that our proposed boosting algorithms can improve the state-of-the-art methods in detection performance.',

A complex pattern recognition problem like face recognition involves huge dimension of input feature vector. To reduce that dimension here we have used eigenspace projection (also called as Principal Component Analysis), which is basically transformation of space. To reduce further we have applied feature selection method to select indispensable features, which will remain in the final feature vectors. Features those are not selected are removed from the final feature vector considering them as redundant or superfluous. For selection of features we have used the concept of reduct and core from rough set theory. This method has shown very good performance. It is worth to mention that in some cases the recognition rate increases with the decrease in the feature vector dimension.',

	{'abstract': u'This paper presents a novel approach to handle the challenges of face recognition. In this work thermal face images are considered, which minimizes the affect of illumination changes and occlusion due to moustache, beards, adornments etc. The proposed approach registers the training and testing thermal face images in polar coordinate, which is capable to handle complicacies introduced by scaling and rotation. Polar images are projected into eigenspace and finally classified using a multi-layer perceptron. In the experiments we have used Object Tracking and Classification Beyond Visible Spectrum (OTCBVS) database benchmark thermal face images. Experimental results show that the proposed approach significantly improves the verification and identification performance and the success rate is 97.05%.',

	{'abstract': u'Algorithms based on multiple decoding attempts of Reed-Solomon (RS) codes have recently attracted new attention. Choosing decoding candidates based on rate-distortion (R-D) theory, as proposed previously by the authors, currently provides the best performance-versus-complexity trade-off. In this paper, an analysis based on the rate-distortion exponent (RDE) is used to directly minimize the exponential decay rate of the error probability. This enables rigorous bounds on the error probability for finite-length RS codes and leads to modest performance gains. As a byproduct, a numerical method is derived that computes the rate-distortion exponent for independent non-identical sources. Analytical results are given for errors/erasures decoding.',

	{'abstract': u'Gameplay research about experiential phenomena is a challenging undertaking, given the variety of experiences that gamers encounter when playing and which currently do not have a formal taxonomy, such as flow, immersion, boredom, and fun. These informal terms require a scientific explanation. Ludologists also acknowledge the need to understand cognition, emotion, and goal- oriented behavior of players from a psychological perspective by establishing rigorous methodologies. This paper builds upon and extends prior work in an area for which we would like to coin the term "affective ludology." The area is concerned with the affective measurement of player-game interaction. The experimental study reported here investigated different traits of gameplay experience using subjective (i.e., questionnaires) and objective (i.e., psychophysiological) measures. Participants played three Half-Life 2 game level design modifications while measures such as electromyography (EMG), electrodermal activity (EDA) were taken and questionnaire responses were collected. A level designed for combat-oriented flow experience demonstrated significant high-arousal positive affect emotions. This method shows that emotional patterns emerge from different level designs, which has great potential for providing real-time emotional profiles of gameplay that may be generated together with self- reported subjective player experience descriptions.',

	{'abstract': u'We exhibit the rich structure of the set of correlated equilibria by analyzing the simplest of polynomial games: the mixed extension of matching pennies. We show that while the correlated equilibrium set is convex and compact, the structure of its extreme points can be quite complicated. In finite games the ratio of extreme correlated to extreme Nash equilibria can be greater than exponential in the size of the strategy spaces. In polynomial games there can exist extreme correlated equilibria which are not finitely supported; we construct a large family of examples using techniques from ergodic theory. We show that in general the set of correlated equilibrium distributions of a polynomial game cannot be described by conditions on finitely many moments (means, covariances, etc.), in marked contrast to the set of Nash equilibria which is always expressible in terms of finitely many moments.',

	{'abstract': u'We present a near-linear time algorithm that approximates the edit distance between two strings within a polylogarithmic factor; specifically, for strings of length n and every fixed epsilon&gt;0, it can compute a (log n)^O(1/epsilon) approximation in n^(1+epsilon) time. This is an exponential improvement over the previously known factor, 2^(O (sqrt(log n))), with a comparable running time (Ostrovsky and Rabani J.ACM 2007; Andoni and Onak STOC 2009). Previously, no efficient polylogarithmic approximation algorithm was known for any computational task involving edit distance (e.g., nearest neighbor search or sketching). This result arises naturally in the study of a new asymmetric query model. In this model, the input consists of two strings x and y, and an algorithm can access y in an unrestricted manner, while being charged for querying every symbol of x. Indeed, we obtain our main result by designing an algorithm that makes a small number of queries in this model. We then provide a nearly-matching lower bound on the number of queries. Our lower bound is the first to expose hardness of edit distance stemming from the input strings being "repetitive", which means that many of their substrings are approximately identical. Consequently, our lower bound provides the first rigorous separation between edit distance and Ulam distance, which is edit distance on non-repetitive strings, such as permutations.',

	{'abstract': u'Steganography is an information hiding application which aims to hide secret data imperceptibly into a commonly used media. Unfortunately, the theoretical hiding asymptotical capacity of steganographic systems is not attained by algorithms developed so far. In this paper, we describe a novel coding method based on Z2Z4-linear codes that conforms to +/-1-steganography, that is secret data is embedded into a cover message by distorting each symbol by one unit at most. This method solves some problems encountered by the most efficient methods known today, based on ternary Hamming codes. Finally, the performance of this new technique is compared with that of the mentioned methods and with the well-known theoretical upper bound.',

	{'abstract': u"Ergodic interference alignment, as introduced by Nazer et al (NGJV), is a technique that allows high-rate communication in n-user interference networks with fast fading. It works by splitting communication across a pair of fading matrices. However, it comes with the overhead of a long time delay until matchable matrices occur: the delay is q^n^2 for field size q. In this paper, we outline two new families of schemes, called JAP and JAP-B, that reduce the expected delay, sometimes at the cost of a reduction in rate from the NGJV scheme. In particular, we give examples of good schemes for networks with few users, and show that in large n-user networks, the delay scales like q^T, where T is quadratic in n for a constant per-user rate and T is constant for a constant sum-rate. We also show that half the single-user rate can be achieved while reducing NGJV's delay from q^n^2 to q^(n-1)(n-2). This extended version includes complete proofs and more details of good schemes for small n.",

Corresponding results for modified-BPDN and BPDN follow as direct corollaries. A second key contribution is an approach to obtain computable error bounds that hold without any sufficient conditions.

Clustering provides an effective method for prolonging lifetime of a WSN. This paper proposes energy efficient multi-level clustering schemes for wireless sensor networks. Wireless sensor nodes are extremely energy constrained with a limited transmission range. Due to large area of deployment, the network needs to have a multi-level clustering protocol that will enable far-off nodes to communicate with the base station. Simulation is used to analyze the proposed protocols and compare their performance with existing protocol EEMC. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed protocols are effective in prolonging the network lifetime.',

	{'abstract': u'The design of embedded control systems is mainly done with model-based tools such as Matlab/Simulink. Numerical simulation is the central technique of development and verification of such tools. Floating-point arithmetic, that is well-known to only provide approximated results, is omnipresent in this activity. In order to validate the behaviors of numerical simulations using abstract interpretation-based static analysis, we present, theoretically and with experiments, a new partially relational abstract domain dedicated to floating-point variables. It comes from interval expansion of non-linear functions using slopes and it is able to mimic all the behaviors of the floating-point arithmetic. Hence it is adapted to prove the absence of run-time errors or to analyze the numerical precision of embedded control systems.',

	{'abstract': u"Cloud computing is a set of services that provide infrastructure resources using internet media and data storage on a third party server. SMEs are said to be the lifeblood of any vibrant economy. They are known to be the silent drivers of a nation's economy. SMEs of India are one of the most aggressive adopters of ERP Packages. Most of the Indian SMEs have adopted the traditional ERP Systems and have incurred a heavy cost while implementing these systems. This paper presents the cost savings and reduction in the level of difficulty in adopting a cloud computing Service (CCS) enabled ERP system. For the study, IT people from 30 North Indian SMEs were interviewed. In the cloud computing environment the SMEs will not have to own the infrastructure so they can abstain from any capital expenditure and instead they can utilize the resources as a service and pay as per their usage. We consider the results of the paper to be supportive to our proposed research concept.",

	{'abstract': u'Power line communication continues to draw increasing interest by promising a wide range of applications including cost-free last-mile communication solution. However, signal transmitted through the power lines deteriorates badly due to the presence of severe inter-symbol interference (ISI) and harsh random pulse noise. This work proposes a new precoded turbo equalization scheme specifically designed for the PLC channels. By introducing useful precoding to reshape ISI, optimizing maximum (MAP) detection to address the non-Gaussian pulse noise, and performing soft iterative decision refinement, the new equalizer demonstrates a gain significantly better than the existing turbo equalizers.',

	{'abstract': u'Opportunistic routing is a multi-hop routing scheme which allows for selection of the best immediately available relay. In blind opportunistic routing protocols, where transmitters blindly broadcast without knowledge of the surrounding nodes, two fundamental design parameters are the node transmission probability and the transmission spectral efficiency. In this paper these parameters are selected to maximize end-to-end performance, characterized by the product of transmitter density, hop distance and rate. Due to the intractability of the problem as stated, an approximation function is examined which proves reasonably accurate. Our results show how the above design parameters should be selected based on inherent system parameters such as the path loss exponent and the noise level.',

Time constraints on the query and on a possible preprocessing of the set family make this problem challenging. Such maximal intersection queries arise in a wide range of applications, including web search, recommendation systems, and distributing on-line advertisements. In general, maximal intersection queries are computationally expensive. We investigate two well-motivated distributions over all families of sets and propose an algorithm for each of them. We show that with very high probability an almost optimal solution is found in time which is logarithmic in the size of the family. Moreover, we point out a threshold phenomenon on the probabilities of intersecting sets in each of our two input models which leads to the efficient algorithms mentioned above.',

	{'abstract': u'Recent work has highlighted deep connections between sequence-length requirements for high-probability phylogeny reconstruction and the related problem of the estimation of ancestral sequences. In [Daskalakis et al.\'09], building on the work of [Mossel\'04], a tight sequence-length requirement was obtained for the CFN model. In particular the required sequence length for high-probability reconstruction was shown to undergo a sharp transition (from to , where is the number of leaves) at the "critical" branch length (if it exists) of the ancestral reconstruction problem. Here we consider the GTR model. For this model, recent results of [Roch\'09] show that the tree can be accurately reconstructed with sequences of length when the branch lengths are below , known as the Kesten-Stigum (KS) bound. Although for the CFN model , it is known that for the more general GTR models one has with a strict inequality in many cases. Here, we show that this phenomenon also holds for phylogenetic reconstruction by exhibiting a family of symmetric models and a phylogenetic reconstruction algorithm which recovers the tree from -length sequences for some branch lengths in the range . Second we prove that phylogenetic reconstruction under GTR models requires a polynomial sequence-length for branch lengths above .',

	{'abstract': u'Recent studies in the field of human vision science suggest that the human responses to the stimuli on a visual display are non-deterministic. People may attend to different locations on the same visual input at the same time. Based on this knowledge, we propose a new stochastic model of visual attention by introducing a dynamic Bayesian network to predict the likelihood of where humans typically focus on a video scene. The proposed model is composed of a dynamic Bayesian network with 4 layers. Our model provides a framework that simulates and combines the visual saliency response and the cognitive state of a person to estimate the most probable attended regions. Sample-based inference with Markov chain Monte-Carlo based particle filter and stream processing with multi-core processors enable us to estimate human visual attention in near real time. Experimental results have demonstrated that our model performs significantly better in predicting human visual attention compared to the previous deterministic models.',

	{'abstract': u'The notion of an ad hoc network is a new paradigm that allows mobile hosts (nodes) to communicate without relying on a predefined infrastructure to keep the network connected. Most nodes are assumed to be mobile and communication is assumed to be wireless. The mobility of nodes in an ad-hoc network means that both the population and the topology of the network are highly dynamic. It is very difficult to design a once-for-all intrusion detection system. A secure protocol should atleast include mechanisms against known attack types. In addition, it should provide a scheme to easily add new security features in the future. The paper includes the detailed description of Proposed Intrusion Detection System based on Local Reputation Scheme. The proposed System also includes concept of Redemption and Fading these are mechanism that allow nodes previously considered malicious to become a part of the network again. The simulation of the proposed system is to be done using NS-2 simulator.',

	{'abstract': u"We consider a general multi-agent convex optimization problem where the agents are to collectively minimize a global objective function subject to a global inequality constraint, a global equality constraint, and a global constraint set. The objective function is defined by a sum of local objective functions, while the global constraint set is produced by the intersection of local constraint sets. In particular, we study two cases: one where the equality constraint is absent, and the other where the local constraint sets are identical. We devise two distributed primal-dual subgradient algorithms which are based on the characterization of the primal-dual optimal solutions as the saddle points of the Lagrangian and penalty functions. These algorithms can be implemented over networks with changing topologies but satisfying a standard connectivity property, and allow the agents to asymptotically agree on optimal solutions and optimal values of the optimization problem under the Slater's condition.",

	{'abstract': u'The famous F5 algorithm for computing Gr "obner basis was presented by Faug `ere in 2002 without complete proofs for its correctness. The current authors have simplified the original F5 algorithm into an F5 algorithm in Buchberger\'s style (F5B algorithm), which is equivalent to original F5 algorithm and may deduce some F5-like versions. In this paper, the F5B algorithm is briefly revisited and a new complete proof for the correctness of F5B algorithm is proposed. This new proof is not limited to homogeneous systems and does not depend on the strategy of selecting critical pairs (i.e. the strategy deciding which critical pair is computed first) such that any strategy could be utilized in F5B (F5) algorithm. From this new proof, we find that the special reduction procedure (F5-reduction) is the key of F5 algorithm, so maintaining this special reduction, various variation algorithms become available. A natural variation of F5 algorithm, which transforms original F5 algorithm to a non-incremental algorithm, is presented and proved in this paper as well. This natural variation has been implemented over the Boolean ring. The two revised criteria in this natural variation are also able to reject almost all unnecessary computations and few polynomials reduce to 0 in most examples.',

	{'abstract': u'Researchers have proposed formal definitions of quantitative information flow based on information theoretic notions such as the Shannon entropy, the min entropy, the guessing entropy, and channel capacity. This paper investigates the hardness and possibilities of precisely checking and inferring quantitative information flow according to such definitions. We prove that, even for just comparing two programs on which has the larger flow, none of the definitions is a k-safety property for any k, and therefore is not amenable to the self-composition technique that has been successfully applied to precisely checking non-interference. We also show a complexity theoretic gap with non-interference by proving that, for loop-free boolean programs whose non-interference is coNP-complete, the comparison problem is #P-hard for all of the definitions. For positive results, we show that universally quantifying the distribution in the comparison problem, that is, comparing two programs according to the entropy based definitions on which has the larger flow for all distributions, is a 2-safety problem in general and is coNP-complete when restricted for loop-free boolean programs. We prove this by showing that the problem is equivalent to a simple relation naturally expressing the fact that one program is more secure than the other. We prove that the relation also refines the channel-capacity based definition, and that it can be precisely checked via the self-composition as well as the "interleaved" self-composition technique.',

	{'abstract': u'Software development effort estimation is one of the most major activities in software project management. A number of models have been proposed to construct a relationship between software size and effort; however we still have problems for effort estimation. This is because project data, available in the initial stages of project is often incomplete, inconsistent, uncertain and unclear. The need for accurate effort estimation in software industry is still a challenge. Artificial Neural Network models are more suitable in such situations. The present paper is concerned with developing software effort estimation models based on artificial neural networks. The models are designed to improve the performance of the network that suits to the COCOMO Model. Artificial Neural Network models are created using Radial Basis and Generalized Regression. A case study based on the COCOMO81 database compares the proposed neural network models with the Intermediate COCOMO. The results were analyzed using five different criterions MMRE, MARE, VARE, Mean BRE and Prediction. It is observed that the Radial Basis Neural Network provided better results',

	{'abstract': u'The Banzhaf power index was introduced in cooperative game theory to measure the real power of players in a game. The Banzhaf interaction index was then proposed to measure the interaction degree inside coalitions of players. It was shown that the power and interaction indexes can be obtained as solutions of a standard least squares approximation problem for pseudo-Boolean functions. Considering certain weighted versions of this approximation problem, we define a class of weighted interaction indexes that generalize the Banzhaf interaction index. We show that these indexes define a subclass of the family of probabilistic interaction indexes and study their most important properties. Finally, we give an interpretation of the Banzhaf and Shapley interaction indexes as centers of mass of this subclass of interaction indexes.',

	{'abstract': u"Bandwidth request-grant mechanisms are used in 802.16 networks to manage the uplink bandwidth needs of subscriber stations (SSs). Requests may be sent by SSs to the base station (BS) by means of several mechanisms defined in the standard. Based on the incoming requests, the BS (which handles most of the bandwidth scheduling in the system) schedules the transmission of uplink traffic, by assigning transmission opportunities to the SSs in an implementation-dependent manner. In this paper we present a study of some bandwidth allocation issues, arising from the management of the perception of subscriber stations' bandwidth needs at the base station. We illustrate how the bandwidth perception varies depending on the policy used to handle requests and grants. By means of ns-2 simulations, we evaluate the potential impact of such policies on the system's aggregate throughput when the traffic is composed of Best-Effort TCP flows.",

	{'abstract': u"The increasing popularity of social networks has initiated a fertile research area in information extraction and data mining. Anonymization of these social graphs is important to facilitate publishing these data sets for analysis by external entities. Prior work has concentrated mostly on node identity anonymization and structural anonymization. But with the growing interest in analyzing social networks as a weighted network, edge weight anonymization is also gaining importance. We present An 'onimos, a Linear Programming based technique for anonymization of edge weights that preserves linear properties of graphs. Such properties form the foundation of many important graph-theoretic algorithms such as shortest paths problem, k-nearest neighbors, minimum cost spanning tree, and maximizing information spread. As a proof of concept, we apply An 'onimos to the shortest paths problem and its extensions, prove the correctness, analyze complexity, and experimentally evaluate it using real social network data sets. Our experiments demonstrate that An 'onimos anonymizes the weights, improves k-anonymity of the weights, and also scrambles the relative ordering of the edges sorted by weights, thereby providing robust and effective anonymization of the sensitive edge-weights. Additionally, we demonstrate the composability of different models generated using An 'onimos, a property that allows a single anonymized graph to preserve multiple linear properties.",

	{'abstract': u'Lattices are important as models for the node locations in wireless networks for two main reasons: (1) When network designers have control over the placement of the nodes, they often prefer a regular arrangement in a lattice for coverage and interference reasons. (2) If nodes are randomly distributed or mobile, good channel access schemes ensure that concurrent transmitters are regularly spaced, hence the locations of the transmitting nodes are well approximated by a lattice. In this paper, we introduce general interference bounding techniques that permit the derivation of tight closed-form upper and lower bounds for all lattice networks, and we present and analyze optimum or near-optimum channel access schemes for one-dimensional, square, and triangular lattices.',

	{'abstract': u"This paper emphasizes a determinant aim of identifying different approaches, as comparing to the education and democracy ways specific to e-government system. Introducing the information technology should offer the possibility by which reform processes of the government should become more efficient, transparent and much more public for the citizens; in this way, their ability of participating directly to government activities should prove the carrying out of a democratic and free frame. One of the essential issues of such phenomenon is that of proving that adopting the information and communication technology programs to government process or electronic government depends upon a series of external factors, such as the level of state's development, the cultural level, the frame of developing the structures of central and local public authority, criteria that differentiate the applicability of such system, to various countries. This difference is especially seen as comparing to the East states of European Union. Information systems can be applied in order to allow the citizens to monitor and coordinate the providing of local services; such exchanges have created trust and the feeling of influence, encouraging the participation to political life. Carrying into effect the new informational technologies, aiming to issuing, informing and to participation of citizens to political life, will model the concept of democracy within a new frame.",

	{'abstract': u"Neurons perform computations, and convey the results of those computations through the statistical structure of their output spike trains. Here we present a practical method, grounded in the information-theoretic analysis of prediction, for inferring a minimal representation of that structure and for characterizing its complexity. Starting from spike trains, our approach finds their causal state models (CSMs), the minimal hidden Markov models or stochastic automata capable of generating statistically identical time series. We then use these CSMs to objectively quantify both the generalizable structure and the idiosyncratic randomness of the spike train. Specifically, we show that the expected algorithmic information content (the information needed to describe the spike train exactly) can be split into three parts describing (1) the time-invariant structure (complexity) of the minimal spike-generating process, which describes the spike train statistically; (2) the randomness (internal entropy rate) of the minimal spike-generating process; and (3) a residual pure noise term not described by the minimal spike-generating process. We use CSMs to approximate each of these quantities. The CSMs are inferred nonparametrically from the data, making only mild regularity assumptions, via the causal state splitting reconstruction algorithm. The methods presented here complement more traditional spike train analyses by describing not only spiking probability and spike train entropy, but also the complexity of a spike train's structure. We demonstrate our approach using both simulated spike trains and experimental data recorded in rat barrel cortex during vibrissa stimulation.",

	{'abstract': u'Much of the current focus in high-performance computing is on multi-threading, multi-computing, and graphics processing unit (GPU) computing. However, vectorization and non-parallel optimization techniques, which can often be employed additionally, are less frequently discussed. In this paper, we present an analysis of several optimizations done on both central processing unit (CPU) and GPU implementations of a particular computationally intensive Metropolis Monte Carlo algorithm. Explicit vectorization on the CPU and the equivalent, explicit memory coalescing, on the GPU are found to be critical to achieving good performance of this algorithm in both environments. The fully-optimized CPU version achieves a 9x to 12x speedup over the original CPU version, in addition to speedup from multi-threading. This is 2x faster than the fully-optimized GPU version.',

In this article we investigate the performance of IEEE 802.11b infrastructure networks in the lossless and lossy environments by means of a simulation study. Also, this study shows how the FIFO discipline of the 802.11b MAC affects on the global performance when at least one channel is under the influence of the bursty errors. Furthermore, this paper proposes a channel aware backoff algorithm for the Access Point (AP) to prioritize its transmissions and to accelerate the transmissions in the poor radio channels to enhance the performance of the real time applications. The final results of this simulation study showed that the proposed algorithm is able to enhance the throughput and the delay in lossy environment by an average of 49% and 83% respectively.',

	{'abstract': u"We consider a stable open queuing network as a steady non-equilibrium system of interacting particles. The network is completely specified by its underlying graphical structure, type of interaction at each node, and the Markovian transition rates between nodes. For such systems, we ask the question ``What is the most likely way for large currents to accumulate over time in a network ?'', where time is large compared to the system correlation time scale. We identify two interesting regimes. In the first regime, in which the accumulation of currents over time exceeds the expected value by a small to moderate amount (moderate large deviation), we find that the large-deviation distribution of currents is universal (independent of the interaction details), and there is no long-time and averaged over time accumulation of particles (condensation) at any nodes. In the second regime, in which the accumulation of currents over time exceeds the expected value by a large amount (severe large deviation), we find that the large-deviation current distribution is sensitive to interaction details, and there is a long-time accumulation of particles (condensation) at some nodes. The transition between the two regimes can be described as a dynamical second order phase transition. We illustrate these ideas using the simple, yet non-trivial, example of a single node with feedback.",

	{'abstract': u"This paper presents two conceptually simple methods for parallelizing a Parallel Tempering Monte Carlo simulation in a distributed volunteer computing context, where computers belonging to the general public are used. The first method uses conventional multi-threading. The second method uses CUDA, a graphics card computing system. Parallel Tempering is described, and challenges such as parallel random number generation and mapping of Monte Carlo chains to different threads are explained. While conventional multi-threading on CPUs is well-established, GPGPU programming techniques and technologies are still developing and present several challenges, such as the effective use of a relatively large number of threads. Having multiple chains in Parallel Tempering allows parallelization in a manner that is similar to the serial algorithm. Volunteer computing introduces important constraints to high performance computing, and we show that both versions of the application are able to adapt themselves to the varying and unpredictable computing resources of volunteers' computers, while leaving the machines responsive enough to use. We present experiments to show the scalable performance of these two approaches, and indicate that the efficiency of the methods increases with bigger problem sizes.",

	{'abstract': u'Neurons are the central biological objects in understanding how the brain works. The famous Hodgkin-Huxley model, which describes how action potentials of a neuron are initiated and propagated, consists of four coupled nonlinear differential equations. Because these equations are difficult to deal with, there also exist several simplified models, of which many exhibit polynomial-like non-linearity. Examples of such models are the Fitzhugh-Nagumo (FHN) model, the Hindmarsh-Rose (HR) model, the Morris-Lecar (ML) model and the Izhikevich model. In this work, we first prescribe the biologically relevant parameter ranges for the FHN model and subsequently study the dynamical behaviour of coupled neurons on small networks of two or three nodes. To do this, we use a computational real algebraic geometry method called the Discriminant Variety (DV) method to perform the stability and bifurcation analysis of these small networks. A time series analysis of the FHN model can be found elsewhere in related work[15].',

	{'abstract': u'This paper provides new results for control of complex flight maneuvers for a quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The flight maneuvers are defined by a concatenation of flight modes or primitives, each of which is achieved by a nonlinear controller that solves an output tracking problem. A mathematical model of the quadrotor UAV rigid body dynamics, defined on the configuration space , is introduced as a basis for the analysis. The quadrotor UAV has four input degrees of freedom, namely the magnitudes of the four rotor thrusts; each flight mode is defined by solving an asymptotic optimal tracking problem. Although many flight modes can be studied, we focus on three output tracking problems, namely (1) outputs given by the vehicle attitude, (2) outputs given by the three position variables for the vehicle center of mass, and (3) output given by the three velocity variables for the vehicle center of mass. A nonlinear tracking controller is developed on the special Euclidean group for each flight mode, and the closed loop is shown to have desirable closed loop properties that are almost global in each case. Several numerical examples, including one example in which the quadrotor recovers from being initially upside down and another example that includes switching and transitions between different flight modes, illustrate the versatility and generality of the proposed approach.',

	{'abstract': u'Wireless Sensor Networks are basically used for gathering information needed by smart environments but they are particularly useful in unattended situations where terrain, climate and other environmental constraints may hinder in the deployment of wired/conventional networks. Unlike traditional networks, these sensor networks do not have a continuous power supply at their disposal. Rather the individual sensors are battery operated and the lifetime of the individual sensors and thus the overall network depend heavily on duty cycle of these sensors. Analysis on WSNs shows that communication module is the main part which consumes most of the sensor energy and that is why energy conservation is the major optimization goal. Since routing protocols and MAC protocols directly access the communication module therefore the design of protocols in these two domains should take into account the energy conservation goal. In this paper, we discuss different state-of-the-art protocols both in MAC and routing domains that have been proposed for WSNs to achieve the overall goal of prolonging the network lifetime. The routing protocols in WSNs are generally categorized into three groups - data centric, hierarchical and location-based but we focus on only the first two categories because location-based routing protocols generally require a prior knowledge about sensors location which most of the times is not available due to random deployment of the sensors. We then discuss how schedule-based and contention-based MAC protocols can contribute to achieve optimal utilization of the limited energy resource by avoiding or reducing the chances of collisions and thus the need for retransmission.',

	{'abstract': u'Adaptive sampling results in dramatic improvements in the recovery of sparse signals in white Gaussian noise. A sequential adaptive sampling-and-refinement procedure called Distilled Sensing (DS) is proposed and analyzed. DS is a form of multi-stage experimental design and testing. Because of the adaptive nature of the data collection, DS can detect and localize far weaker signals than possible from non-adaptive measurements. In particular, reliable detection and localization (support estimation) using non-adaptive samples is possible only if the signal amplitudes grow logarithmically with the problem dimension. Here it is shown that using adaptive sampling, reliable detection is possible provided the amplitude exceeds a constant, and localization is possible when the amplitude exceeds any arbitrarily slowly growing function of the dimension.',

	{'abstract': u'We consider the problem of demodulating M-ary optical PPM (pulse-position modulation) waveforms, and propose a structured receiver whose mean probability of symbol error is smaller than all known receivers, and approaches the quantum limit. The receiver uses photodetection coupled with optimized phase-coherent optical feedback control and a phase-sensitive parametric amplifier. We present a general framework of optical receivers known as the conditional pulse nulling receiver, and present new results on ultimate limits and achievable regions of spectral versus photon efficiency tradeoffs for the single-spatial-mode pure-loss optical communication channel.',

In such models, agents update their vector-valued opinion to a convex combination (possibly agent- and opinion-dependent) of their current value and that of another observed agent. It is shown that, in the limit of large agent population size, the empirical opinion density concentrates, at an exponential probability rate, around the solution of a probability-measure-valued ordinary differential equation describing the system's mean-field dynamics. Properties of the associated initial value problem are studied. The asymptotic behavior of the solution is analyzed for bounded-confidence opinion dynamics, and in the presence of an heterogeneous influential environment.",

	{'abstract': u'Multicast plays an important role in implementing the group communications in bandwidth scarce multihop mobile ad hoc networks. However, due to the dynamic topology of MANETs it is very difficult to build optimal multicast trees and maintaining group membership, making even more challenging to implement scalable and robust multicast in Mobile Ad hoc Networks (MANET). A scalable and energy efficient location aware multicast algorithm, called SEELAMP, for mobile ad hoc networks is presented in the paper that is based on creation of shared tree using the physical location of the nodes for the multicast sessions. It constructs a shared bi-directional multicast tree for its routing operations rather than a mesh, which helps in achieving more efficient multicast delivery. The algorithm uses the concept of small overlapped zones around each node for proactive topology maintenance with in the zone. Protocol depends on the location information obtained using a distributed location service, which effectively reduces the overheads for route searching and shared multicast tree maintenance. In this paper a new technique of local connectivity management is being proposed that attempts to improve the performance and reliability. It employs a preventive route reconfiguration to avoid the latency in case of link breakages and to prevent the network from splitting.',

	{'abstract': u'This paper considers distributed computing on an anonymous quantum network, a network in which no party has a unique identifier and quantum communication and computation are available. It is proved that the leader election problem can exactly (i.e., without error in bounded time) be solved with at most the same complexity up to a constant factor as that of exactly computing symmetric functions (without intermediate measurements for a distributed and superposed input), if the number of parties is given to every party. A corollary of this result is a more efficient quantum leader election algorithm than existing ones: the new quantum algorithm runs in O(n) rounds with bit complexity O(mn^2), on an anonymous quantum network with n parties and m communication links. Another corollary is the first quantum algorithm that exactly computes any computable Boolean function with round complexity O(n) and with smaller bit complexity than that of existing classical algorithms in the worst case over all (computable) Boolean functions and network topologies. More generally, any n-qubit state can be shared with that complexity on an anonymous quantum network with n parties.',

	{'abstract': u'Routing the packets efficiently in mobile ad hoc network does not have end to end paths. Multiple copies are forwarded from the source to the destination. To deal with such networks, researches introduced flooding based routing schemes which leads to high probability of delivery. But the flooding based routing schemes suffered with contention and large delays. Here the proposed protocol "Spray Select Focus", sprays a few message copies into the network, neighbors receives a copy and by that relay nodes we are choosing the shortest route and then route that copy towards the destination. Previous works assumption is that there is no contention and dead ends. But we argue that contention and dead ends must be considered for finding efficiency in routing. So we are including a network which has contention and dead ends and we applied the proposed protocol. We can say that this protocol works well for the contention based network.',

This system enables librarians to broaden users profiles beyond the information that users have introduced by hand (such as institution, age and language). The system requires a context retrieval layer to capture user information and behavior, and an inference engine to support context inference from many information sources (selected documents and users' queries).",

	{'abstract': u'Optimization under uncertainty deals with the problem of optimizing stochastic cost functions given some partial information on their inputs. These problems are extremely difficult to solve and yet pervade all areas of technological and natural sciences. We propose a general approach to solve such large-scale stochastic optimization problems and a Survey Propagation based algorithm that implements it. In the problems we consider some of the parameters are not known at the time of the first optimization, but are extracted later independently of each other from known distributions. As an illustration, we apply our method to the stochastic bipartite matching problem, in the two-stage and multi-stage cases. The efficiency of our approach, which does not rely on sampling techniques, allows us to validate the analytical predictions with large-scale numerical simulations.',

	{'abstract': u"Gene-gene interactions have long been recognized to be fundamentally important to understand genetic causes of complex disease traits. At present, identifying gene-gene interactions from genome-wide case-control studies is computationally and methodologically challenging. In this paper, we introduce a simple but powerful method, named `BOolean Operation based Screening and Testing'(BOOST). To discover unknown gene-gene interactions that underlie complex diseases, BOOST allows examining all pairwise interactions in genome-wide case-control studies in a remarkably fast manner. We have carried out interaction analyses on seven data sets from the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium (WTCCC). Each analysis took less than 60 hours on a standard 3.0 GHz desktop with 4G memory running Windows XP system. The interaction patterns identified from the type 1 diabetes data set display significant difference from those identified from the rheumatoid arthritis data set, while both data sets share a very similar hit region in the WTCCC report. BOOST has also identified many undiscovered interactions between genes in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) region in the type 1 diabetes data set. In the coming era of large-scale interaction mapping in genome-wide case-control studies, our method can serve as a computationally and statistically useful tool.",

	{'abstract': u'The description of complex configuration is a difficult issue. We present a powerful technique for cluster identification and characterization. The scheme is designed to treat with and analyze the experimental and/or simulation data from various methods. Main steps are as follows. We first divide the space using face or volume elements from discrete points. Then, combine the elements with the same and/or similar properties to construct clusters with special physical characterizations. In the algorithm, we adopt administrative structure of hierarchy-tree for spatial bodies such as points, lines, faces, blocks, and clusters. Two fast search algorithms with the complexity are realized. The establishing of the hierarchy-tree and the fast searching of spatial bodies are general, which are independent of spatial dimensions. Therefore, it is easy to extend the skill to other fields. As a verification and validation, we treated with and analyzed some two-dimensional and three-dimensional random data.',

	{'abstract': u'This paper studies a Markov chain for phylogenetic reconstruction which uses a popular transition between tree topologies known as subtree pruning-and-regrafting (SPR). We analyze the Markov chain in the simpler setting that the generating tree consists of very short edge lengths, short enough so that each sample from the generating tree (or character in phylogenetic terminology) is likely to have only one mutation, and that there enough samples so that the data looks like the generating distribution. We prove in this setting that the Markov chain is rapidly mixing, i.e., it quickly converges to its stationary distribution, which is the posterior distribution over tree topologies. Our proofs use that the leading term of the maximum likelihood function of a tree T is the maximum parsimony score, which is the size of the minimum cut in T needed to realize single edge cuts of the generating tree. Our main contribution is a combinatorial proof that in our simplified setting, SPR moves are guaranteed to converge quickly to the maximum parsimony tree. Our results are in contrast to recent works showing examples with heterogeneous data (namely, the data is generated from a mixture distribution) where many natural Markov chains are exponentially slow to converge to the stationary distribution.',

	{'abstract': u'We show that all perfect odd integer squares not divisible by 3, can be usefully written as sqrt(N) = a + 18p, where the constant a is determined by the basic properties of N. The equation can be solved deterministically by an efficient four step algorithm that is solely based on integer arithmetic. There is no required multiplication or division by multiple digit integers, nor does the algorithm need a seed value. It finds the integer p when N is a perfect square, and certifies N as a non-square when the algorithm terminates without a solution. The number of iterations scales approximately as log(sqrt(N)/2) for square roots. The paper also outlines how one of the methods discussed for squares can be extended to finding an arbitrary root of N. Finally, we present a rule that distinguishes products of twin primes from squares.',

	{'abstract': u'To asses stability against 1/f noise, the Low Frequency Instrument (LFI) onboard the Planck mission will acquire data at a rate much higher than the data rate allowed by its telemetry bandwith of 35.5 kbps. The data are processed by an onboard pipeline, followed onground by a reversing step. This paper illustrates the LFI scientific onboard processing to fit the allowed datarate. This is a lossy process tuned by using a set of 5 parameters Naver, r1, r2, q, O for each of the 44 LFI detectors. The paper quantifies the level of distortion introduced by the onboard processing, EpsilonQ, as a function of these parameters. It describes the method of optimizing the onboard processing chain. The tuning procedure is based on a optimization algorithm applied to unprocessed and uncompressed raw data provided either by simulations, prelaunch tests or data taken from LFI operating in diagnostic mode. All the needed optimization steps are performed by an automated tool, OCA2, which ends with optimized parameters and produces a set of statistical indicators, among them the compression rate Cr and EpsilonQ. For Planck/LFI the requirements are Cr = 2.4 and EpsilonQ &lt;= 10% of the rms of the instrumental white noise. To speedup the process an analytical model is developed that is able to extract most of the relevant information on EpsilonQ and Cr as a function of the signal statistics and the processing parameters. This model will be of interest for the instrument data analysis. The method was applied during ground tests when the instrument was operating in conditions representative of flight. Optimized parameters were obtained and the performance has been verified, the required data rate of 35.5 Kbps has been achieved while keeping EpsilonQ at a level of 3.8% of white noise rms well within the requirements.',

	{'abstract': u'A practical communication channel often suffers from constraints on input other than the average power, such as the peak power constraint. In order to compare achievable rates with different constellations as well as the channel capacity under such constraints, it is crucial to take these constraints into consideration properly. In this paper, we propose a direct approach to compare the achievable rates of practical input constellations and the capacity under such constraints. As an example, we study the discrete-time complex-valued additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel and compare the capacity under the peak power constraint with the achievable rates of phase shift keying (PSK) and quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) input constellations.',

	{'abstract': u'The usual way to investigate the statistical properties of finitely generated subgroups of free groups, and of finite presentations of groups, is based on the so-called word-based distribution: subgroups are generated (finite presentations are determined) by randomly chosen k-tuples of reduced words, whose maximal length is allowed to tend to infinity. In this paper we adopt a different, though equally natural point of view: we investigate the statistical properties of the same objects, but with respect to the so-called graph-based distribution, recently introduced by Bassino, Nicaud and Weil. Here, subgroups (and finite presentations) are determined by randomly chosen Stallings graphs whose number of vertices tends to infinity. Our results show that these two distributions behave quite differently from each other, shedding a new light on which properties of finitely generated subgroups can be considered frequent or rare. For example, we show that malnormal subgroups of a free group are negligible in the graph-based distribution, while they are exponentially generic in the word-based distribution. Quite surprisingly, a random finite presentation generically presents the trivial group in this new distribution, while in the classical one it is known to generically present an infinite hyperbolic group.',

	{'abstract': u"If a quantum system is subject to noise, it is possible to perform quantum error correction reversing the action of the noise if and only if no information about the system's quantum state leaks to the environment. In this article, we develop an analogous duality in the case that the environment approximately forgets the identity of the quantum state, a weaker condition satisfied by epsilon-randomizing maps and approximate unitary designs. Specifically, we show that the environment approximately forgets quantum states if and only if the original channel approximately preserves pairwise fidelities of pure inputs, an observation we call weak decoupling duality. Using this tool, we then go on to study the task of using the output of a channel to simulate restricted classes of measurements on a space of input states. The case of simulating measurements that test whether the input state is an arbitrary pure state is known as equality testing or quantum identification. An immediate consequence of weak decoupling duality is that the ability to perform quantum identification cannot be cloned. We furthermore establish that the optimal amortized rate at which quantum states can be identified through a noisy quantum channel is equal to the entanglement-assisted classical capacity of the channel, despite the fact that the task is quantum, not classical, and entanglement-assistance is not allowed. In particular, this rate is strictly positive for every non-constant quantum channel, including classical channels.",

	{'abstract': u'Since most components of sparse multi-path channel (SMPC) are zero, impulse response of SMPC can be recovered from a short training sequence. Though the ordinary orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) algorithm provides a very fast implementation of SMPC estimation, it suffers from inter-atom interference (IAI), especially in the case of SMPC with a large delay spread and short training sequence. In this paper, an adaptive IAI mitigation method is proposed to improve the performance of SMPC estimation based on a general OMP algorithm. Unlike the ordinary OMP algorithm, a sensing dictionary is designed adaptively and posterior information is utilized efficiently to prevent false atoms from being selected due to serious IAI. Numeral experiments illustrate that the proposed general OMP algorithm based on adaptive IAI mitigation outperform both the ordinary OMP algorithm and the general OMP algorithm based on non-adaptive IAI mitigation.',

	{'abstract': u'Probabilistic matrix factorization (PMF) is a powerful method for modeling data associated with pairwise relationships, finding use in collaborative filtering, computational biology, and document analysis, among other areas. In many domains, there is additional information that can assist in prediction. For example, when modeling movie ratings, we might know when the rating occurred, where the user lives, or what actors appear in the movie. It is difficult, however, to incorporate this side information into the PMF model. We propose a framework for incorporating side information by coupling together multiple PMF problems via Gaussian process priors. We replace scalar latent features with functions that vary over the space of side information. The GP priors on these functions require them to vary smoothly and share information. We successfully use this new method to predict the scores of professional basketball games, where side information about the venue and date of the game are relevant for the outcome.',

	{'abstract': u"We consider scheduling packets with values in a capacity-bounded buffer in an online setting. In this model, there is a buffer with limited capacity . At any time, the buffer cannot accommodate more than packets. Packets arrive over time. Each packet is associated with a non-negative value. Packets leave the buffer only because they are either sent or dropped. Those packets that have left the buffer will not be reconsidered for delivery any more. In each time step, at most one packet in the buffer can be sent. The order in which the packets are sent should comply with the order of their arrival time. The objective is to maximize the total value of the packets sent in an online manner. In this paper, we study a variant of this FIFO buffering model in which a packet's value is either 1 or . We present a deterministic memoryless 1.304-competitive algorithm. This algorithm has the same competitive ratio as the one presented in (Lotker and Patt-Shamir. PODC 2002, Computer Networks 2003). However, our algorithm is simpler and does not employ any marking bits. The idea used in our algorithm is novel and different from all previous approaches applied for the general model and its variants. We do not proactively preempt one packet when a new packet arrives. Instead, we may preempt more than one 1-value packet when the buffer contains sufficiently many -value packets.",

	{'abstract': u'Modern Internet services, such as those at Google, Yahoo!, and Amazon, handle billions of requests per day on clusters of thousands of computers. Because these services operate under strict performance requirements, a statistical understanding of their performance is of great practical interest. Such services are modeled by networks of queues, where each queue models one of the computers in the system. A key challenge is that the data are incomplete, because recording detailed information about every request to a heavily used system can require unacceptable overhead. In this paper we develop a Bayesian perspective on queueing models in which the arrival and departure times that are not observed are treated as latent variables. Underlying this viewpoint is the observation that a queueing model defines a deterministic transformation between the data and a set of independent variables called the service times. With this viewpoint in hand, we sample from the posterior distribution over missing data and model parameters using Markov chain Monte Carlo. We evaluate our framework on data from a benchmark Web application. We also present a simple technique for selection among nested queueing models. We are unaware of any previous work that considers inference in networks of queues in the presence of missing data.',

The logical length is the length of a shortest defining sentence. We survey known estimates for these graph parameters and discuss their relations to other topics (such as the efficiency of the Weisfeiler-Lehman algorithm in isomorphism testing, the evolution of a random graph, quantitative characteristics of the zero-one law, or the contribution of Frank Ramsey to the research on Hilbert's Entscheidungsproblem). Also, we trace the behavior of the descriptive complexity of a graph as the logic becomes more restrictive (for example, only definitions with a bounded number of variables or quantifier alternations are allowed) or more expressible (after powering with counting quantifiers).",

	{'abstract': u'In many scientific domains, researchers are turning to large-scale behavioral simulations to better understand important real-world phenomena. While there has been a great deal of work on simulation tools from the high-performance computing community, behavioral simulations remain challenging to program and automatically scale in parallel environments. In this paper we present BRACE (Big Red Agent-based Computation Engine), which extends the MapReduce framework to process these simulations efficiently across a cluster. We can leverage spatial locality to treat behavioral simulations as iterated spatial joins and greatly reduce the communication between nodes. In our experiments we achieve nearly linear scale-up on several realistic simulations. Though processing behavioral simulations in parallel as iterated spatial joins can be very efficient, it can be much simpler for the domain scientists to program the behavior of a single agent. Furthermore, many simulations include a considerable amount of complex computation and message passing between agents, which makes it important to optimize the performance of a single node and the communication across nodes. To address both of these challenges, BRACE includes a high-level language called BRASIL (the Big Red Agent SImulation Language). BRASIL has object oriented features for programming simulations, but can be compiled to a data-flow representation for automatic parallelization and optimization. We show that by using various optimization techniques, we can achieve both scalability and single-node performance similar to that of a hand-coded simulation.',

	{'abstract': u'It has been asserted previously by the author that optimal control theory can be a valuable framework for theoretical studies about the shape that a wind instrument should have in order to satisfy some optimization criterion, inside a fairly general class. The purpose of the present work is to develop this new approach with a look at a specific criterion to be optimized. In this setting, the Webster horn equation is regarded as a controlled dynamical equation in the space variable. Pressure is the state, the control being made of two parts: one variable part, the inside diameter of the duct and one constant part, the weights of the elementary time-harmonic components of the velocity potential. Then one looks for a control that optimizes a criterion related to the definition of an as the cooperation of several natural modes of vibration with the excitation, the being the one that maximizes the total generation of energy, as exposed by A.H. Benade, following H. Bouasse. At the same time the relevance of this criterion is questioned with the simulation results.',

	{'abstract': u'Combining tree decomposition and transfer matrix techniques provides a very general algorithm for computing exact partition functions of statistical models defined on arbitrary graphs. The algorithm is particularly efficient in the case of planar graphs. We illustrate it by computing the Potts model partition functions and chromatic polynomials (the number of proper vertex colourings using Q colours) for large samples of random planar graphs with up to N=100 vertices. In the latter case, our algorithm yields a sub-exponential average running time of ~ exp(1.516 sqrt(N)), a substantial improvement over the exponential running time ~ exp(0.245 N) provided by the hitherto best known algorithm. We study the statistics of chromatic roots of random planar graphs in some detail, comparing the findings with results for finite pieces of a regular lattice.',

	{'abstract': u'Nominal Logic is a version of first-order logic with equality, name-binding, renaming via name-swapping and freshness of names. Contrarily to higher-order logic, bindable names, called atoms, and instantiable variables are considered as distinct entities. Moreover, atoms are capturable by instantiations, breaking a fundamental principle of lambda-calculus. Despite these differences, nominal unification can be seen from a higher-order perspective. From this view, we show that nominal unification can be reduced to a particular fragment of higher-order unification problems: Higher-Order Pattern Unification. This reduction proves that nominal unification can be decided in quadratic deterministic time, using the linear algorithm for Higher-Order Pattern Unification. We also prove that the translation preserves most generality of unifiers.',

	{'abstract': u'minimization is often used for finding the sparse solutions of an under-determined linear system. In this paper we focus on finding sharp performance bounds on recovering approximately sparse signals using minimization, possibly under noisy measurements. While the restricted isometry property is powerful for the analysis of recovering approximately sparse signals with noisy measurements, the known bounds on the achievable sparsity (The "sparsity" in this paper means the size of the set of nonzero or significant elements in a signal vector.) level can be quite loose. The neighborly polytope analysis which yields sharp bounds for ideally sparse signals cannot be readily generalized to approximately sparse signals. Starting from a necessary and sufficient condition, the "balancedness" property of linear subspaces, for achieving a certain signal recovery accuracy, we give a unified emph-based geometric framework for analyzing the performance of minimization. By investigating the "balancedness" property, this unified framework characterizes sharp quantitative tradeoffs between the considered sparsity and the recovery accuracy of the optimization. As a consequence, this generalizes the neighborly polytope result for ideally sparse signals. Besides the robustness in the "strong" sense for emph sparse signals, we also discuss the notions of "weak" and "sectional" robustness. Our results concern fundamental properties of linear subspaces and so may be of independent mathematical interest.',

This result is a simple consequence of Martin\'s determinacy theorem, but its proof is instructive: it shows how one can prove statements about Kolmogorov complexity by constructing a special game and a winning strategy in this game.

	{'abstract': u'We describe and analyze a new algorithm for agnostically learning kernel-based halfspaces with respect to the emph loss function. Unlike most previous formulations which rely on surrogate convex loss functions (e.g. hinge-loss in SVM and log-loss in logistic regression), we provide finite time/sample guarantees with respect to the more natural zero-one loss function. The proposed algorithm can learn kernel-based halfspaces in worst-case time , for distribution, where is a Lipschitz constant (which can be thought of as the reciprocal of the margin), and the learned classifier is worse than the optimal halfspace by at most . We also prove a hardness result, showing that under a certain cryptographic assumption, no algorithm can learn kernel-based halfspaces in time polynomial in .',

	{'abstract': u"In this article, we study the (d-1)-volume and the covering numbers of the medial axis of a compact set of the Euclidean d-space. In general, this volume is infinite; however, the (d-1)-volume and covering numbers of a filtered medial axis (the mu-medial axis) that is at distance greater than R from the compact set will be explicitely bounded. The behaviour of the bound we obtain with respect to mu, R and the covering numbers of the compact set K are optimal. From this result we deduce that the projection function on a compact subset K of the Euclidean d-space depends continuously on the compact set K, in the L^1 sense. This implies in particular that Federer's curvature measure of a compact set with positive reach can be reliably estimated from a Hausdorff approximation of this set, regardless of any regularity assumption on the approximation.",

	{'abstract': u'The random K-satisfiability (K-SAT) problem is an important problem for studying typical-case complexity of NP-complete combinatorial satisfaction; it is also a representative model of finite-connectivity spin-glasses. In this paper we review our recent efforts on the solution space fine structures of the random K-SAT problem. A heterogeneity transition is predicted to occur in the solution space as the constraint density alpha reaches a critical value alpha_cm. This transition marks the emergency of exponentially many solution communities in the solution space. After the heterogeneity transition the solution space is still ergodic until alpha reaches a larger threshold value alpha_d, at which the solution communities disconnect from each other to become different solution clusters (ergodicity-breaking). The existence of solution communities in the solution space is confirmed by numerical simulations of solution space random walking, and the effect of solution space heterogeneity on a stochastic local search algorithm SEQSAT, which performs a random walk of single-spin flips, is investigated. The relevance of this work to glassy dynamics studies is briefly mentioned.',

	{'abstract': u'We consider the question of the stability of evolutionary algorithms to gradual changes, or drift, in the target concept. We define an algorithm to be resistant to drift if, for some inverse polynomial drift rate in the target function, it converges to accuracy 1 -- epsilon , with polynomial resources, and then stays within that accuracy indefinitely, except with probability epsilon , at any one time. We show that every evolution algorithm, in the sense of Valiant (2007; 2009), can be converted using the Correlational Query technique of Feldman (2008), into such a drift resistant algorithm. For certain evolutionary algorithms, such as for Boolean conjunctions, we give bounds on the rates of drift that they can resist. We develop some new evolution algorithms that are resistant to significant drift. In particular, we give an algorithm for evolving linear separators over the spherically symmetric distribution that is resistant to a drift rate of O( epsilon /n), and another algorithm over the more general product normal distributions that resists a smaller drift rate. The above translation result can be also interpreted as one on the robustness of the notion of evolvability itself under changes of definition. As a second result in that direction we show that every evolution algorithm can be converted to a quasi-monotonic one that can evolve from any starting point without the performance ever dipping significantly below that of the starting point. This permits the somewhat unnatural feature of arbitrary performance degradations to be removed from several known robustness translations.',

	{'abstract': u'We study the national production of academic knowledge in all Iberoamerican countries (IAC) between 1973 and 2007. We show that the total number of mainstream scientific publications listed in SCI,SSCI and A&amp;HCI follows an exponential growth, the same as the national productivity expressed in the number of publications per capita. We also explore the temporal evolution of the co-authorship patterns between a sample of 12 IAC responsible for 98% of the total regional publications, with a group of other 45 nations. We show that the scientific co-authorship among countries follows a power-law and behaves as a self-organizing scale-free network, where each country appears as a node and each co-publication as a link. We develop a mathematical model to study the temporal evolution of co-authorship networks, based on a preferential attachment strategy and we show that the number of co-publications among countries growths quadraticly against time. We empirically determine the quadratic growth constants for 352 different networks within. We corroborate that the connectivity of regional countries with larger scientific networks is growing faster than with other less connected countries. We determine the dates, at which the co-authorship connectivities trigger the self-organizing scale free network for each of the 352 cases. We find that the last follows a normal distribution around year 1981.4 +/-2.2 and we connect the last effect with a brain-drainage process generated in the region. We show how the number of co-publications Pki (t) between country k and country i, is related with a power-law against the coupling growth coefficients aki.',

	{'abstract': u'Switched-Capacitor Converters (SCC) suffer from a fundamental power loss deficiency which make their use in some applications prohibitive. The power loss is due to the inherent energy dissipation when SCC operate between or outside their output target voltages. This drawback was alleviated in this work by developing two new classes of SCC providing binary and arbitrary resolution of closely spaced target voltages. Special attention is paid to SCC topologies of binary resolution. Namely, SCC systems that can be configured to have a no-load output to input voltage ratio that is equal to any binary fraction for a given number of bits. To this end, we define a new number system and develop rules to translate these numbers into SCC hardware that follows the algebraic behavior. According to this approach, the flying capacitors are automatically kept charged to binary weighted voltages and consequently the resolution of the target voltages follows a binary number representation and can be made higher by increasing the number of capacitors (bits). The ability to increase the number of target voltages reduces the spacing between them and, consequently, increases the efficiency when the input varies over a large voltage range. The thesis presents the underlining theory of the binary SCC and its extension to the general radix case. Although the major application is in step-down SCC, a simple method to utilize these SCC for step-up conversion is also described, as well as a method to reduce the output voltage ripple. In addition, the generic and unified model is strictly applied to derive the SCC equivalent resistor, which is a measure of the power loss. The theoretical predictions are verified by simulation and experimental results.',

	{'abstract': u'In this paper we describe a HepML format and a corresponding C++ library developed for keeping complete description of parton level events in a unified and flexible form. HepML tags contain enough information to understand what kind of physics the simulated events describe and how the events have been prepared. A HepML block can be included into event files in the LHEF format. The structure of the HepML block is described by means of several XML Schemas. The Schemas define necessary information for the HepML block and how this information should be located within the block. The library libhepml is a C++ library intended for parsing and serialization of HepML tags, and representing the HepML block in computer memory. The library is an API for external software. For example, Matrix Element Monte Carlo event generators can use the library for preparing and writing a header of a LHEF file in the form of HepML tags.

	{'abstract': u"CG, SYMMLQ, and MINRES are Krylov subspace methods for solving symmetric systems of linear equations. When these methods are applied to an incompatible system (that is, a singular symmetric least-squares problem), CG could break down and SYMMLQ's solution could explode, while MINRES would give a least-squares solution but not necessarily the minimum-length (pseudoinverse) solution. This understanding motivates us to design a MINRES-like algorithm to compute minimum-length solutions to singular symmetric systems. MINRES uses QR factors of the tridiagonal matrix from the Lanczos process (where R is upper-tridiagonal). MINRES-QLP uses a QLP decomposition (where rotations on the right reduce R to lower-tridiagonal form). On ill-conditioned systems (singular or not), MINRES-QLP can give more accurate solutions than MINRES. We derive preconditioned MINRES-QLP, new stopping rules, and better estimates of the solution and residual norms, the matrix norm, and the condition number.",

	{'abstract': u'The well-known Impossibility Theorem of Arrow asserts that any Generalized Social Welfare Function (GSWF) with at least three alternatives, which satisfies Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives (IIA) and Unanimity and is not a dictatorship, is necessarily non-transitive. In 2002, Kalai asked whether one can obtain the following quantitative version of the theorem: For any , there exists such that if a GSWF on three alternatives satisfies the IIA condition and its probability of non-transitive outcome is at most , then the GSWF is at most -far from being a dictatorship or from breaching the Unanimity condition. In 2009, Mossel proved such quantitative version, with , and generalized it to GSWFs with alternatives, for all . In this paper we show that the quantitative version holds with , and that this result is tight up to logarithmic factors. Furthermore, our result (like Mossel\'s) generalizes to GSWFs with alternatives. Our proof is based on the works of Kalai and Mossel, but uses also an additional ingredient: a combination of the Bonami-Beckner hypercontractive inequality with a reverse hypercontractive inequality due to Borell, applied to find simultaneously upper bounds and lower bounds on the "noise correlation" between Boolean functions on the discrete cube.',

	{'abstract': u'In computational molecular biology, gene regulatory binding sites prediction in whole genome remains a challenge for the researchers. Now a days, the genome wide regulatory binding site prediction tools required either direct pattern sequence or weight matrix. Although there are known transcription factor binding sites databases available for genome wide prediction but no tool is available which can construct different weight matrices as per need of user or tools available for large data set scanning by first aligning the input upstream or promoter sequences and than construct the matrices in different level and file format. Considering this, we developed a DNA MATRIX tool for searching putative regulatory binding sites in gene upstream sequences. This tool uses the simple biological rule based heuristic algorithm for weight matrix construction, which can be transformed into different formats after motif alignment and therefore provides the possibility to identify the most potential conserved binding sites in the regulated genes. The user may construct and save specific weight or frequency matrices in different form and file formats based on user based selection of conserved aligned block of short sequences ranges from 6 to 20 base pairs and prior nucleotide frequency before weight scoring.',

	{'abstract': u'We present introductory considerations and analysis toward computing applications based on the recently introduced deterministic logic scheme with random spike (pulse) trains [Phys. Lett. A 373 (2009) 2338-2342]. Also, in considering the questions, "Why random?" and "Why pulses?", we show that the random pulse based scheme provides the advantages of realizing multivalued deterministic logic. Pulse trains are realized by an element called orthogonator. We discuss two different types of orthogonators, parallel (intersection-based) and serial (demultiplexer-based) orthogonators. The last one can be slower but it makes sequential logic design straightforward. We propose generating a multidimensional logic hyperspace [Physics Letters A 373 (2009) 1928-1934] by using the zero-crossing events of uncorrelated Gaussian electrical noises available in the chips. The spike trains in the hyperspace are non-overlapping, and are referred to as neuro-bits. To demonstrate this idea, we generate 3-dimensional hyperspace bases using 2 Gaussian noises as sources for neuro-bits, respectively. In such a scenario, the detection of different hyperspace basis elements may have vastly differing delays. We show that it is possible to provide an identical speed for all the hyperspace bases elements using correlated noise sources, and demonstrate this for the 2 neuro-bits situations. The key impact of this paper is to demonstrate that a logic design approach using such neuro-bits can yield a fast, low power processing and environmental variation tolerant means of designing computer circuitry. It also enables the realization of multi-valued logic, significantly increasing the complexity of computer circuits by allowing several neuro-bits to be transmitted on a single wire.',

	{'abstract': u'For many algorithmic problems, traditional algorithms that optimise on the number of instructions executed prove expensive on I/Os. Novel and very different design techniques, when applied to these problems, can produce algorithms that are I/O efficient. This thesis adds to the growing chorus of such results. The computational models we use are the external memory model and the W-Stream model. On the external memory model, we obtain the following results. (1) An I/O efficient algorithm for computing minimum spanning trees of graphs that improves on the performance of the best known algorithm. (2) The first external memory version of soft heap, an approximate meldable priority queue. (3) Hard heap, the first meldable external memory priority queue that matches the amortised I/O performance of the known external memory priority queues, while allowing a meld operation at the same amortised cost. (4) I/O efficient exact, approximate and randomised algorithms for the minimum cut problem, which has not been explored before on the external memory model. (5) Some lower and upper bounds on I/Os for interval graphs. On the W-Stream model, we obtain the following results. (1) Algorithms for various tree problems and list ranking that match the performance of the best known algorithms and are easier to implement than them. (2) Pass efficient algorithms for sorting, and the maximal independent set problems, that improve on the best known algorithms. (3) Pass efficient algorithms for the graphs problems of finding vertex-colouring, approximate single source shortest paths, maximal matching, and approximate weighted vertex cover. (4) Lower bounds on passes for list ranking and maximal matching. We propose two variants of the W-Stream model, and design algorithms for the maximal independent set, vertex-colouring, and planar graph single source shortest paths problems on those models.',

	{'abstract': u"Coding theorems in quantum Shannon theory express the ultimate rates at which a sender can transmit information over a noisy quantum channel. More often than not, the known formulas expressing these transmission rates are intractable, requiring an optimization over an infinite number of uses of the channel. Researchers have rarely found quantum channels with a tractable classical or quantum capacity, but when such a finding occurs, it demonstrates a complete understanding of that channel's capabilities for transmitting classical or quantum information. Here, we show that the three-dimensional capacity region for entanglement-assisted transmission of classical and quantum information is tractable for the Hadamard class of channels. Examples of Hadamard channels include generalized dephasing channels, cloning channels, and the Unruh channel. The generalized dephasing channels and the cloning channels are natural processes that occur in quantum systems through the loss of quantum coherence or stimulated emission, respectively. The Unruh channel is a noisy process that occurs in relativistic quantum information theory as a result of the Unruh effect and bears a strong relationship to the cloning channels. We give exact formulas for the entanglement-assisted classical and quantum communication capacity regions of these channels. The coding strategy for each of these examples is superior to a naive time-sharing strategy, and we introduce a measure to determine this improvement.",

	{'abstract': u'Deterministic execution offers many benefits for debugging, fault tolerance, and security. Running parallel programs deterministically is usually difficult and costly, however - especially if we desire system-enforced determinism, ensuring precise repeatability of arbitrarily buggy or malicious software. Determinator is a novel operating system that enforces determinism on both multithreaded and multi-process computations. Determinator\'s kernel provides only single-threaded, "shared-nothing" address spaces interacting via deterministic synchronization. An untrusted user-level runtime uses distributed computing techniques to emulate familiar abstractions such as Unix processes, file systems, and shared memory multithreading. The system runs parallel applications deterministically both on multicore PCs and across nodes in a cluster. Coarse-grained parallel benchmarks perform and scale comparably to - sometimes better than - conventional systems, though determinism is costly for fine-grained parallel applications.',

A stochastic model is formulated to examine message advancements under greedy routing in such a sensor network. The aim of this work is to demonstrate that an inhomogeneous Poisson process can be used to model a sensor network with spatially-dependent node density. Elliptic integrals and asymptotic approximations are used to describe the random behaviour of hops. Types of dependence that affect hop advancements are examined. We observe that the dependence between successive jumps in a multihop path is captured by including only the previous forwarding node location. We include a simple uncoordinated sleep scheme, and observe that the complexity of the model is reduced when enough nodes are asleep. All expressions involving multidimensional integrals are derived and evaluated with quasi-Monte Carlo integration methods based on Halton sequences and recently-developed lattice rules. An importance sampling function is derived to speed up the quasi-Monte Carlo methods. The ensuing results agree extremely well with simulations.',

	{'abstract': u"Spatio-temporal preferences and encounter statistics provide realistic measures to understand mobile user's behavioral preferences and transfer opportunities in Delay Tolerant Networks (DTNs). The time dependent behavior and periodic reappearances at specific locations can approximate future online presence while encounter statistics can aid to forward the routing decisions. It is theoretically shown that such characteristics heavily affect the performance of routing protocols. Therefore, mobility models demonstrating such characteristics are also expected to show identical routing performance. However, we argue models despite capturing these properties deviate from their expected routing performance. We use realistic traces to validate this observation on two mobility models. Our empirical results for epidemic routing show those models' largely differ (delay 67% &amp; reachability 79%) from the observed values. This in-turn call for two important activities: (i) Analogous to routing, explore structural properties on a Global scale (ii) Design new mobility models that capture them.",

	{'abstract': u'In this paper we present two algorithms for the computation of a diagonal form of a matrix over non-commutative Euclidean domain over a field with the help of Gr "obner bases. This can be viewed as the pre-processing for the computation of Jacobson normal form and also used for the computation of Smith normal form in the commutative case. We propose a general framework for handling, among other, operator algebras with rational coefficients. We employ special "polynomial" strategy in Ore localizations of non-commutative -algebras and show its merits. In particular, for a given matrix we provide an algorithm to compute and with fraction-free entries such that holds. The polynomial approach allows one to obtain more precise information, than the rational one e. g. about singularities of the system. Our implementation of polynomial strategy shows very impressive performance, compared with methods, which directly use fractions. In particular, we experience quite moderate swell of coefficients and obtain uncomplicated transformation matrices. This shows that this method is well suitable for solving nontrivial practical problems. We present an implementation of algorithms in SINGULAR:PLURAL and compare it with other available systems. We leave questions on the algorithmic complexity of this algorithm open, but we stress the practical applicability of the proposed method to a bigger class of non-commutative algebras.',

	{'abstract': u'Classic decision-theory is based on the maximum expected utility (MEU) principle, but crucially ignores the resource costs incurred when determining optimal decisions. Here we propose an axiomatic framework for bounded decision-making that considers resource costs. Agents are formalized as probability measures over input-output streams. We postulate that any such probability measure can be assigned a corresponding conjugate utility function based on three axioms: utilities should be real-valued, additive and monotonic mappings of probabilities. We show that these axioms enforce a unique conversion law between utility and probability (and thereby, information). Moreover, we show that this relation can be characterized as a variational principle: given a utility function, its conjugate probability measure maximizes a free utility functional. Transformations of probability measures can then be formalized as a change in free utility due to the addition of new constraints expressed by a target utility function. Accordingly, one obtains a criterion to choose a probability measure that trades off the maximization of a target utility function and the cost of the deviation from a reference distribution. We show that optimal control, adaptive estimation and adaptive control problems can be solved this way in a resource-efficient way. When resource costs are ignored, the MEU principle is recovered. Our formalization might thus provide a principled approach to bounded rationality that establishes a close link to information theory.',

	{'abstract': u'In pinning control of complex networks, a tacit believing is that the system dynamics will be better controlled by pinning the large-degree nodes than the small-degree ones. Here, by changing the number of pinned nodes, we find that, when a significant fraction of the network nodes are pinned, pinning the small-degree nodes could generally have a higher performance than pinning the large-degree nodes. We demonstrate this interesting phenomenon on a variety of complex networks, and analyze the underlying mechanisms by the model of star networks. By changing the network properties, we also find that, comparing to densely connected homogeneous networks, the advantage of the small-degree pinning strategy is more distinct in sparsely connected heterogenous networks.',

	{'abstract': u'Self-stabilization is a versatile approach to fault-tolerance since it permits a distributed system to recover from any transient fault that arbitrarily corrupts the contents of all memories in the system. Byzantine tolerance is an attractive feature of distributed systems that permits to cope with arbitrary malicious behaviors. Combining these two properties proved difficult: it is impossible to contain the spatial impact of Byzantine nodes in a self-stabilizing context for global tasks such as tree orientation and tree construction. We present and illustrate a new concept of Byzantine containment in stabilization. Our property, called Strong Stabilization enables to contain the impact of Byzantine nodes if they actually perform too many Byzantine actions. We derive impossibility results for strong stabilization and present strongly stabilizing protocols for tree orientation and tree construction that are optimal with respect to the number of Byzantine nodes that can be tolerated in a self-stabilizing context.',

Similarly, for a corpus consisting of texts translated into Polish from other languages the scale-invariant regime is broken more strongly than for a comparable corpus of native Polish texts. Moreover, we find that if the words are tagged with their proper part of speech, only verbs show rank-frequency distribution that is almost scale-invariant.',

It is known, that it is complicated to obtain it computationally, as a number of open questions and challenges indicate. In this paper we propose a family of algorithms called texttt for optimized check of whether a given rational number is a root of Bernstein-Sato polynomial and the computations of its multiplicity. This algorithms are used in the new approach to compute the whole global or local Bernstein-Sato polynomial and -function of a holonomic ideal with respect to weights. They are applied in numerous situations, where there is a possibility to compute an upper bound for the polynomial. Namely, it can be achieved by means of embedded resolution, for topologically equivalent singularities or using the formula of A'Campo and spectral numbers. We also present approaches to the logarithmic comparison problem and the intersection homology D-module. Several applications are presented as well as solutions to some challenges which were intractable with the classical methods. One of the main applications consists of computing of a stratification of affine space with the local -function being constant on each stratum. Notably, the algorithm we propose does not employ primary decomposition. Also we apply our results for the computation of Bernstein-Sato polynomials for varieties.

Using differential evolution, we design punctured systematic LDPC codes to maximize the region of achievable channel conditions, with joint iterative decoding. The main contribution of this paper is to demonstrate that properly designed LDPC can perform well simultaneously over a wide range of channel parameters.',

	{'abstract': u'We characterize the capacity region to within 2 bits/s/Hz and the symmetric capacity to within 1 bit/s/Hz for the two-user Gaussian interference channel (IC) with feedback. We develop achievable schemes and derive a new outer bound to arrive at this conclusion. One consequence of the result is that feedback provides multiplicative gain, i.e., the gain becomes arbitrarily large for certain channel parameters. It is a surprising result because feedback has been so far known to provide no gain in memoryless point-to-point channels and only bounded additive gain in multiple access channels. The gain comes from using feedback to maximize resource utilization, thereby enabling more efficient resource sharing between the interfering users. The result makes use of a deterministic model to provide insights into the Gaussian channel. This deterministic model is a special case of El Gamal-Costa deterministic model and as a side-generalization, we establish the exact feedback capacity region of this general class of deterministic ICs.',

The main goal of application-layer multicast is to construct and maintain efficient distribution structures between end-hosts. In this paper we focus on the implementation of an application-layer multicast distribution algorithm. We observe that the total time required to measure network latency over TCP is influenced dramatically by the TCP connection time. We argue that end-host distribution is not only influenced by the quality of network links but also by the time required to make connections between nodes. We provide several solutions to decrease the total end-host distribution time.',

	{'abstract': u'Motivated by the problem of dealing with incomplete or imprecise acquisition of data in computer vision and computer graphics, we extend results concerning the stability of persistent homology with respect to function perturbations to results concerning the stability with respect to domain perturbations. Domain perturbations can be measured in a number of different ways. An important method to compare domains is the Hausdorff distance. We show that by encoding sets using the distance function, the multidimensional matching distance between rank invariants of persistent homology groups is always upperly bounded by the Hausdorff distance between sets. Moreover we prove that our construction maintains information about the original set. Other well known methods to compare sets are considered, such as the symmetric difference distance between classical sets and the sup-distance between fuzzy sets. Also in these cases we present results stating that the multidimensional matching distance between rank invariants of persistent homology groups is upperly bounded by these distances. An experiment showing the potential of our approach concludes the paper.',

	{'abstract': u'Leakage of confidential information represents a serious security risk. Despite a number of novel, theoretical advances, it has been unclear if and how quantitative approaches to measuring leakage of confidential information could be applied to substantial, real-world programs. This is mostly due to the high complexity of computing precise leakage quantities. In this paper, we introduce a technique which makes it possible to decide if a program conforms to a quantitative policy which scales to large state-spaces with the help of bounded model checking. Our technique is applied to a number of officially reported information leak vulnerabilities in the Linux Kernel. Additionally, we also analysed authentication routines in the Secure Remote Password suite and of a Internet Message Support Protocol implementation. Our technique shows when there is unacceptable leakage; the same technique is also used to verify, for the first time, that the applied software patches indeed plug the information leaks. This is the first demonstration of quantitative information flow addressing security concerns of real-world industrial programs.',

	{'abstract': u'Shannon\'s theory of zero-error communication is re-examined in the broader setting of using one classical channel to simulate another exactly, and in the presence of various resources that are all classes of non-signalling correlations: Shared randomness, shared entanglement and arbitrary non-signalling correlations. Specifically, when the channel being simulated is noiseless, this reduces to the zero-error capacity of the channel, assisted by the various classes of non-signalling correlations. When the resource channel is noiseless, it results in the "reverse" problem of simulating a noisy channel exactly by a noiseless one, assisted by correlations. In both cases, \'one-shot\' separations between the power of the different assisting correlations are exhibited. The most striking result of this kind is that entanglement can assist in zero-error communication, in stark contrast to the standard setting of communicaton with asymptotically vanishing error in which entanglement does not help at all. In the asymptotic case, shared randomness is shown to be just as powerful as arbitrary non-signalling correlations for noisy channel simulation, which is not true for the asymptotic zero-error capacities. For assistance by arbitrary non-signalling correlations, linear programming formulas for capacity and simulation are derived, the former being equal (for channels with non-zero unassisted capacity) to the feedback-assisted zero-error capacity originally derived by Shannon to upper bound the unassisted zero-error capacity. Finally, a kind of reversibility between non-signalling-assisted capacity and simulation is observed, mirroring the famous "reverse Shannon theorem".',

We consider non-ergodic fading channels where microscopic fading channel information is not available at the transmitters. As a result, packet outage occurs whenever the data rate of packet transmissions exceeds the instantaneous mutual information even if powerful channel coding is applied for protection. We are interested to study the role of macro-diversity (MDiv) between multiple base stations on the MUD-SIC performance where the effect of potential error-propagation during the SIC processing is taken into account. While the jointly optimal power and decoding order in the MUD-SIC are NP hard problem, we derive a simple on/off power control and asymptotically optimal decoding order with respect to the transmit power. Based on the information theoretical framework, we derive the closed-form expressions on the total system goodput as well as the per-user packet outage probability. We show that the system goodput does not scale with SNR due to mutual interference in the SIC process and macro-diversity (MDiv) could alleviate the problem and benefit to the system goodput.',

	{'abstract': u'A wide family of nonlinear sequence generators, the so-called clock-controlled shrinking generators, has been analyzed and identified with a subset of linear cellular automata. The algorithm that converts the given generator into a linear model based on automata is very simple and can be applied in a range of practical interest. Due to the linearity of these automata as well as the characteristics of this class of generators, a cryptanalytic approach can be proposed. Linear cellular structures easily model keystream generators with application in stream cipher cryptography.',

	{'abstract': u"Understanding the universe is hampered by the elusiveness of its most common constituent, cold dark matter. Almost impossible to observe, dark matter can be studied effectively by means of simulation and there is probably no other research field where simulation has led to so much progress in the last decade. Cosmological N-body simulations are an essential tool for evolving density perturbations in the nonlinear regime. Simulating the formation of large-scale structures in the universe, however, is still a challenge due to the enormous dynamic range in spatial and temporal coordinates, and due to the enormous computer resources required. The dynamic range is generally dealt with by the hybridization of numerical techniques. We deal with the computational requirements by connecting two supercomputers via an optical network and make them operate as a single machine. This is challenging, if only for the fact that the supercomputers of our choice are separated by half the planet, as one is located in Amsterdam and the other is in Tokyo. The co-scheduling of the two computers and the 'gridification' of the code enables us to achieve a 90% efficiency for this distributed intercontinental supercomputer.",

Despite the role of this assumption in theoretical models such as preferential attachment, it has received very little direct empirical investigation. Here we develop a formalization and methodology for studying this type of directed closure process, and we provide evidence for its important role in the formation of links on Twitter. We then analyze a sequence of models designed to capture the structural phenomena related to directed closure that we observe in the Twitter data.',

	{'abstract': u'In this contribution, an algorithm for evaluating the capacity-achieving input covariance matrices for frequency selective Rayleigh MIMO channels is proposed. In contrast with the flat fading Rayleigh case, no closed-form expressions for the eigenvectors of the optimum input covariance matrix are available. Classically, both the eigenvectors and eigenvalues are computed numerically and the corresponding optimization algorithms remain computationally very demanding. In this paper, it is proposed to optimize (w.r.t. the input covariance matrix) a large system approximation of the average mutual information derived by Moustakas and Simon. The validity of this asymptotic approximation is clarified thanks to Gaussian large random matrices methods. It is shown that the approximation is a strictly concave function of the input covariance matrix and that the average mutual information evaluated at the argmax of the approximation is equal to the capacity of the channel up to a O(1/t) term, where t is the number of transmit antennas. An algorithm based on an iterative waterfilling scheme is proposed to maximize the average mutual information approximation, and its convergence studied. Numerical simulation results show that, even for a moderate number of transmit and receive antennas, the new approach provides the same results as direct maximization approaches of the average mutual information.',

Whereas the case where both groups are abelian is well understood and can be solved efficiently, very little is known about the complexity of isomorphism testing for nonabelian groups. Le Gall has constructed an efficient classical algorithm for a class of groups corresponding to one of the most natural ways of constructing nonabelian groups from abelian groups: the groups that are extensions of an abelian group by a cyclic group with the order of coprime with . More precisely, the running time of that algorithm is almost linear in the order of the input groups. In this paper we present a quantum algorithm solving the same problem in time polynomial in the logarithm of the order of the input groups. This algorithm works in the black-box setting and is the first quantum algorithm solving instances of the nonabelian group isomorphism problem exponentially faster than the best known classical algorithms.',

Such a mix of positive and negative links arise in a variety of online settings; we study datasets from Epinions, Slashdot and Wikipedia. We find that the signs of links in the underlying social networks can be predicted with high accuracy, using models that generalize across this diverse range of sites. These models provide insight into some of the fundamental principles that drive the formation of signed links in networks, shedding light on theories of balance and status from social psychology; they also suggest social computing applications by which the attitude of one user toward another can be estimated from evidence provided by their relationships with other members of the surrounding social network.',

The key operation in VANETs is the broadcast of messages. Consequently, the vehicles need to make sure that the information has been sent by an authentic node in the network. VANETs present unique challenges such as high node mobility, real-time constraints, scalability, gradual deployment and privacy. No existent technique addresses all these requirements. In particular, both inter-vehicle and vehicle-to-roadside wireless communications present different characteristics that should be taken into account when defining node authentication services. That is exactly what is done in this paper, where the features of inter-vehicle and vehicle-to-roadside communications are analyzed to propose differentiated services for node authentication, according to privacy and efficiency needs.',

	{'abstract': u'The stable marriage (SM) problem has a wide variety of practical applications, ranging from matching resident doctors to hospitals, to matching students to schools, or more generally to any two-sided market. In the classical formulation, n men and n women express their preferences (via a strict total order) over the members of the other sex. Solving a SM problem means finding a stable marriage where stability is an envy-free notion: no man and woman who are not married to each other would both prefer each other to their partners or to being single. We consider both the classical stable marriage problem and one of its useful variations (denoted SMTI) where the men and women express their preferences in the form of an incomplete preference list with ties over a subset of the members of the other sex. Matchings are permitted only with people who appear in these lists, an we try to find a stable matching that marries as many people as possible. Whilst the SM problem is polynomial to solve, the SMTI problem is NP-hard. We propose to tackle both problems via a local search approach, which exploits properties of the problems to reduce the size of the neighborhood and to make local moves efficiently. We evaluate empirically our algorithm for SM problems by measuring its runtime behaviour and its ability to sample the lattice of all possible stable marriages. We evaluate our algorithm for SMTI problems in terms of both its runtime behaviour and its ability to find a maximum cardinality stable marriage.For SM problems, the number of steps of our algorithm grows only as O(nlog(n)), and that it samples very well the set of all stable marriages. It is thus a fair and efficient approach to generate stable marriages.Furthermore, our approach for SMTI problems is able to solve large problems, quickly returning stable matchings of large and often optimal size despite the NP-hardness of this problem.',

	{'abstract': u'The celebrated Kermack-McKendric model of epidemics studies the transmission of a disease in a population where each individual is initially susceptible (S), may become infective (I) and then removed or recovered (R) and plays no further epidemiological role. This ODE model arises as the limiting case of a network model where each individual has an equal chance of infecting every other. More recent work gives explicit consideration to the network of social interaction and attendant probability of transmission for each interacting pair. The state of such a network is an assignment of the values to its members. Given such a network, an initial state and a particular susceptible individual, we would like to compute their probability of becoming infected in the course of an epidemic. It turns out that this problem is NP-hard. In particular, it belongs in a class of problems all of whose known solutions require an exponential amount of computation and for which it is unlikely that there will be more efficient solutions.',

	{'abstract': u'Relations between users on social media sites often reflect a mixture of positive (friendly) and negative (antagonistic) interactions. In contrast to the bulk of research on social networks that has focused almost exclusively on positive interpretations of links between people, we study how the interplay between positive and negative relationships affects the structure of on-line social networks. We connect our analyses to theories of signed networks from social psychology. We find that the classical theory of structural balance tends to capture certain common patterns of interaction, but that it is also at odds with some of the fundamental phenomena we observe --- particularly related to the evolving, directed nature of these on-line networks. We then develop an alternate theory of status that better explains the observed edge signs and provides insights into the underlying social mechanisms. Our work provides one of the first large-scale evaluations of theories of signed networks using on-line datasets, as well as providing a perspective for reasoning about social media sites.',

	{'abstract': u'This volume contains the papers presented at the first international workshop on Logics for Component Configuration (LoCoCo 2010) which was associated with the International Conference on Theory and Applications of Satisfiability Testing (SAT 2010) as part of the Federated Logic Conference (FLoC 2010), and which took place on July 10, 2010 in Edinburgh, UK. Modern software distributions are based on the notion of components, which denote units of independent development and deployment. Components provide the necessary flexibility when organizing a complex software distribution, but also are a challenge when it comes to selecting components from a large repository of possible choices, and configuring these components according to user needs, resource constraints, and interdependencies with other components. Representing and solving configuration problems is a hot topic of great importance for many application domains. Some well-known examples of complex systems of components are Free and Open Source software distributions like GNU/Linux, or Eclipse plugins. The LoCoCo workshop has a focus on logic-based methods for specifying and solving complex configuration problems for software components. The goal was to bring together both researchers and practitioners active in the area of component configuration of software systems, using different modeling and solving techniques, such as constraint and logic programing, description logics, satisfiability and its extensions.',

	{'abstract': u'The quality of a simulator equipped with a haptic interface is given by the dynamical properties of its components: haptic interface, simulator and control system. Some application areas of such kind of simulator like musical synthesis, animation or more general, instrumental art have specific requirements as for the "haptic rendering" of small movements that go beyond the usual haptic interfaces allow. Object properties variability and different situations of object combination represent important aspects of such type of application which makes that the user can be interested as much in the restitution of certain global properties of an entire object domain as in the restitution of properties that are specific to an isolate object. In the traditional approaches, the usual criteria are founded on the paradigm of transparency and are related to the impedance error introduced by the technical aspects of the system. As a general aim, rather than to minimize these effects, we look to characterize them by physical metaphors conferring to haptic medium the role of a tool. This positioning leads to firstly analyze the natural human object interaction as a simplified evolutive system and then considers its synthesis in the case of the interactive physical simulation. By means of a frequential method, this approach is presented for some elementary configurations of the simulator',

	{'abstract': u'We address in this paper the problem of multi-channel signal sequence labeling. In particular, we consider the problem where the signals are contaminated by noise or may present some dephasing with respect to their labels. For that, we propose to jointly learn a SVM sample classifier with a temporal filtering of the channels. This will lead to a large margin filtering that is adapted to the specificity of each channel (noise and time-lag). We derive algorithms to solve the optimization problem and we discuss different filter regularizations for automated scaling or selection of channels. Our approach is tested on a non-linear toy example and on a BCI dataset. Results show that the classification performance on these problems can be improved by learning a large margin filtering.',

	{'abstract': u'Given a simplicial complex with weights on its simplices, and a nontrivial cycle on it, we are interested in finding the cycle with minimal weight which is homologous to the given one. Assuming that the homology is defined with integer coefficients, we show the following : For a finite simplicial complex of dimension greater than , the boundary matrix is totally unimodular if and only if is torsion-free, for all pure subcomplexes in of dimensions and respectively, where is a subset of . Because of the total unimodularity of the boundary matrix, we can solve the optimization problem, which is inherently an integer programming problem, as a linear program and obtain integer solution. Thus the problem of finding optimal cycles in a given homology class can be solved in polynomial time. This result is surprising in the backdrop of a recent result which says that the problem is NP-hard under coefficients which, being a field, is in general easier to deal with. One consequence of our result, among others, is that one can compute in polynomial time an optimal 2-cycle in a given homology class for any finite simplicial complex embedded in . Our optimization approach can also be used for various related problems, such as finding an optimal chain homologous to a given one when these are not cycles.',

	{'abstract': u'The past few years have witnessed the great success of a new family of paradigms, so-called folksonomy, which allows users to freely associate tags to resources and efficiently manage them. In order to uncover the underlying structures and user behaviors in folksonomy, in this paper, we propose an evolutionary hypergrah model to explain the emerging statistical properties. The present model introduces a novel mechanism that one can not only assign tags to resources, but also retrieve resources via collaborative tags. We then compare the model with a real-world dataset: emph. Indeed, the present model shows considerable agreement with the empirical data in following aspects: power-law hyperdegree distributions, negtive correlation between clustering coefficients and hyperdegrees, and small average distances. Furthermore, the model indicates that most tagging behaviors are motivated by labeling tags to resources, and tags play a significant role in effectively retrieving interesting resources and making acquaintance with congenial friends. The proposed model may shed some light on the in-depth understanding of the structure and function of folksonomy.',

In contrast to the solution proposed by ourselves for a similar problem using hashing for privacy amplification, in the current paper we use a technique of extractors. We propose modified key distribution protocols for which we prove explicit estimates of key rates without the use of estimates with uncertain coefficients in notations . This leads in the new conclusion that the use of extractors is superior to the use of hash functions only with the very large key lengths (of order bits). We suggest hybrid key distribution protocols consisting from two consecutively executed stages. At the fist stage it is generated a short authentication key based on hash function, whereas at the second stage it is generated the final key with the use of extractors. We show that in fact the use of extraction procedure is effective only at the second stage. We get also some constructive estimates of the key rates for such protocols.',

	{'abstract': u"This paper asks a new question: how can we control the collective behavior of self-organized multi-agent systems? We try to answer the question by proposing a new notion called 'Soft Control', which keeps the local rule of the existing agents in the system. We show the feasibility of soft control by a case study. Consider the simple but typical distributed multi-agent model proposed by Vicsek et al. for flocking of birds: each agent moves with the same speed but with different headings which are updated using a local rule based on the average of its own heading and the headings of its neighbors. Most studies of this model are about the self-organized collective behavior, such as synchronization of headings. We want to intervene in the collective behavior (headings) of the group by soft control. A specified method is to add a special agent, called a 'Shill', which can be controlled by us but is treated as an ordinary agent by other agents. We construct a control law for the shill so that it can synchronize the whole group to an objective heading. This control law is proved to be effective analytically and numerically. Note that soft control is different from the approach of distributed control. It is a natural way to intervene in the distributed systems. It may bring out many interesting issues and challenges on the control of complex systems.",

For channels with small capacity, receivers needs to collects many channel outputs to recover information bits. Since a collected channel output yields a check node in the decoding Tanner graph, the channel with small capacity leads to large decoding complexity. In this paper, we introduce a novel fountain coding scheme with non-binary LDPC codes. The decoding complexity of the proposed fountain code does not depend on the channel. Numerical experiments show that the proposed codes exhibit better performance than conventional fountain codes, especially for small number of information bits.',

However, proofs of existence of such subspaces were probabilistic, hence non-constructive, which made the results not-quite-suitable for subsequently discovered applications to high-dimensional nearest neighbor search, error-correcting codes over the reals, compressive sensing and other computational problems.

This is a rich family of functions which encompasses many of the important examples in the literature. It is thus of great interest to understand what properties of and affect the communication complexity of , and in what way. Recently, Sherstov cite and independently Shi-Zhu cite developed conditions on the inner function which imply that the quantum communication complexity of is at least the approximate polynomial degree of . We generalize both of these frameworks. We show that the pattern matrix framework of Sherstov works whenever the inner function is ---we say that is strongly balanced if all rows and columns in the matrix sum to zero. This result strictly generalizes the pattern matrix framework of Sherstov cite, which has been a very useful idea in a variety of settings cite. Shi-Zhu require that the inner function has small , a somewhat awkward condition to verify. We relax this to the usual notion of discrepancy. We also enhance the framework of composed functions studied so far by considering functions , where the range of is a group . When is Abelian, the analogue of the strongly balanced condition becomes a simple group invariance property of . We are able to formulate a general lower bound on whenever satisfies this property.',

	{'abstract': u"We introduce the notion of a network's conduciveness, a probabilistically interpretable measure of how the network's structure allows it to be conducive to roaming agents, in certain conditions, from one portion of the network to another. We exemplify its use through an application to the two problems in combinatorial optimization that, given an undirected graph, ask that its so-called chromatic and independence numbers be found. Though NP-hard, when solved on sequences of expanding random graphs there appear marked transitions at which optimal solutions can be obtained substantially more easily than right before them. We demonstrate that these phenomena can be understood by resorting to the network that represents the solution space of the problems for each graph and examining its conduciveness between the non-optimal solutions and the optimal ones. At the said transitions, this network becomes strikingly more conducive in the direction of the optimal solutions than it was just before them, while at the same time becoming less conducive in the opposite direction. We believe that, besides becoming useful also in other areas in which network theory has a role to play, network conduciveness may become instrumental in helping clarify further issues related to NP-hardness that remain poorly understood.",

	{'abstract': u'Dependently typed lambda calculi such as the Logical Framework (LF) are capable of representing relationships between terms through types. By exploiting the "formulas-as-types" notion, such calculi can also encode the correspondence between formulas and their proofs in typing judgments. As such, these calculi provide a natural yet powerful means for specifying varied formal systems. Such specifications can be transformed into a more direct form that uses predicate formulas over simply typed lambda-terms and that thereby provides the basis for their animation using conventional logic programming techniques. However, a naive use of this idea is fraught with inefficiencies arising from the fact that dependently typed expressions typically contain much redundant typing information. We investigate syntactic criteria for recognizing and, hence, eliminating such redundancies. In particular, we identify a property of bound variables in LF types called "rigidity" and formally show that checking that instantiations of such variables adhere to typing restrictions is unnecessary for the purpose of ensuring that the overall expression is well-formed. We show how to exploit this property in a translation based approach to executing specifications in the Twelf language. Recognizing redundancy is also relevant to devising compact representations of dependently typed expressions. We highlight this aspect of our work and discuss its connection with other approaches proposed in this context.',

First, we show that any bounded-error nonadaptive quantum query algorithm that computes some total boolean function depending on n variables must make Omega(n) queries to the input in total. Second, we show that, if there exists a quantum algorithm that uses k nonadaptive oracle queries to learn which one of a set of m boolean functions it has been given, there exists a nonadaptive classical algorithm using O(k log m) queries to solve the same problem. Thus, in the nonadaptive setting, quantum algorithms can achieve at most a very limited speed-up over classical query algorithms.',

	{'abstract': u'Several variants of a stochastic local search process for constructing the synaptic weights of an Ising perceptron are studied. In this process, binary patterns are sequentially presented to the Ising perceptron and are then learned as the synaptic weight configuration is modified through a chain of single- or double-weight flips within the compatible weight configuration space of the earlier learned patterns. This process is able to reach a storage capacity of for pattern length N = 101 and for N = 1001. If in addition a relearning process is exploited, the learning performance is further improved to a storage capacity of for N = 101 and for N=1001. We found that, for a given learning task, the solutions constructed by the random walk learning process are separated by a typical Hamming distance, which decreases with the constraint density of the learning task; at a fixed value of , the width of the Hamming distance distributions decreases with .',

	{'abstract': u'When agents are acting together, they may need a simple mechanism to decide on joint actions. One possibility is to have the agents express their preferences in the form of a ballot and use a voting rule to decide the winning action(s). Unfortunately, agents may try to manipulate such an election by misreporting their preferences. Fortunately, it has been shown that it is NP-hard to compute how to manipulate a number of different voting rules. However, NP-hardness only bounds the worst-case complexity. Recent theoretical results suggest that manipulation may often be easy in practice. To address this issue, I suggest studying empirically if computational complexity is in practice a barrier to manipulation. The basic tool used in my investigations is the identification of computational "phase transitions". Such an approach has been fruitful in identifying hard instances of propositional satisfiability and other NP-hard problems. I show that phase transition behaviour gives insight into the hardness of manipulating voting rules, increasing concern that computational complexity is indeed any sort of barrier. Finally, I look at the problem of computing manipulation of other, related problems like stable marriage and tournament problems.',

	{'abstract': u'This paper is the second part of a series of two papers dealing with bulking: a way to define quasi-order on cellular automata by comparing space-time diagrams up to rescaling. In the present paper, we introduce three notions of simulation between cellular automata and study the quasi-order structures induced by these simulation relations on the whole set of cellular automata. Various aspects of these quasi-orders are considered (induced equivalence relations, maximum elements, induced orders, etc) providing several formal tools allowing to classify cellular automata.',

	{'abstract': u"Slovenia's Current Research Information System (SICRIS) currently hosts 86,443 publications with citation data from 8,359 researchers working on the whole plethora of social and natural sciences from 1970 till present. Using these data, we show that the citation distributions derived from individual publications have Zipfian properties in that they can be fitted by a power law , with between 2.4 and 3.1 depending on the institution and field of research. Distributions of indexes that quantify the success of researchers rather than individual publications, on the other hand, cannot be associated with a power law. We find that for Egghe's g-index and Hirsch's h-index the log-normal form applies best, with and depending moderately on the underlying set of researchers. In special cases, particularly for institutions with a strongly hierarchical constitution and research fields with high self-citation rates, exponential distributions can be observed as well. Both indexes yield distributions with equivalent statistical properties, which is a strong indicator for their consistency and logical connectedness. At the same time, differences in the assessment of citation histories of individual researchers strengthen their importance for properly evaluating the quality and impact of scientific output.",

	{'abstract': u"In the current Internet, there is no clean way for affected parties to react to poor forwarding performance: when a domain violates its Service Level Agreement (SLA) with a contractual partner, the partner must resort to ad-hoc probing-based monitoring to determine the existence and extent of the violation. Instead, we propose a new, systematic approach to the problem of forwarding-performance verification. Our mechanism relies on voluntary reporting, allowing each domain to disclose its loss and delay performance to its neighbors; it does not disclose any information regarding the participating domains' topology or routing policies beyond what is already publicly available. Most importantly, it enables verifiable performance measurements, i.e., domains cannot abuse it to significantly exaggerate their performance. Finally, our mechanism is tunable, allowing each participating domain to determine how many resources to devote to it independently (i.e., without any inter-domain coordination), exposing a controllable trade-off between performance-verification quality and resource consumption. Our mechanism comes at the cost of deploying modest functionality at the participating domains' border routers; we show that it requires reasonable processing and memory resources within modern network capabilities.",

	{'abstract': u'This paper presents experimental results of the implementation of network steganography method called RSTEG (Retransmission Steganography). The main idea of RSTEG is to not acknowledge a successfully received packet to intentionally invoke retransmission. The retransmitted packet carries a steganogram instead of user data in the payload field. RSTEG can be applied to many network protocols that utilize retransmissions. We present experimental results for RSTEG applied to TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) as TCP is the most popular network protocol which ensures reliable data transfer. The main aim of the performed experiments was to estimate RSTEG steganographic bandwidth and detectability by observing its influence on the network retransmission level.',

	{'abstract': u'This paper studies directional dynamics in cellular automata, a formalism previously introduced by the third author. The central idea is to study the dynamical behaviour of a cellular automaton through the conjoint action of its global rule (temporal action) and the shift map (spacial action): qualitative behaviours inherited from topological dynamics (equicontinuity, sensitivity, expansivity) are thus considered along arbitrary curves in space-time. The main contributions of the paper concern equicontinuous dynamics which can be connected to the notion of consequences of a word. We show that there is a cellular automaton with an equicontinuous dynamics along a parabola, but which is sensitive along any linear direction. We also show that real numbers that occur as the slope of a limit linear direction with equicontinuous dynamics in some cellular automaton are exactly the computably enumerable numbers.',

	{'abstract': u'The common utilization-based definition of available bandwidth and many of the existing tools to estimate it suffer from several important weaknesses: i) most tools report a point estimate of average available bandwidth over a measurement interval and do not provide a confidence interval; ii) the commonly adopted models used to relate the available bandwidth metric to the measured data are invalid in almost all practical scenarios; iii) existing tools do not scale well and are not suited to the task of multi-path estimation in large-scale networks; iv) almost all tools use ad-hoc techniques to address measurement noise; and v) tools do not provide enough flexibility in terms of accuracy, overhead, latency and reliability to adapt to the requirements of various applications. In this paper we propose a new definition for available bandwidth and a novel framework that addresses these issues. We define probabilistic available bandwidth (PAB) as the largest input rate at which we can send a traffic flow along a path while achieving, with specified probability, an output rate that is almost as large as the input rate. PAB is expressed directly in terms of the measurable output rate and includes adjustable parameters that allow the user to adapt to different application requirements. Our probabilistic framework to estimate network-wide probabilistic available bandwidth is based on packet trains, Bayesian inference, factor graphs and active sampling. We deploy our tool on the PlanetLab network and our results show that we can obtain accurate estimates with a much smaller measurement overhead compared to existing approaches.',

Today's largest problems, which often originate from multidimensional data, might profit from even higher levels of abstraction.

In contrast to the conventional matrix approach, it allows the formulation of multidimensional problems, in a multidimensional way, preserving structure and data coherence; and the implementation of automated optimizations of solving algorithms, based on the commutativity of all tensor operations. Its ability to handle large scientific tasks is showcased by a real-world, 4D medical imaging problem, with more than 30 million unknown parameters solved on a current, inexpensive hardware.

While introducing several novel theoretical perspectives, this work has yet to lead to practical algorithms. In an effort to bridge this gap, we describe in this paper two related results. Our first and main result is a simple algorithm to approximate the solution to a set of linear equations defined by a Laplacian (for a graph with nodes and edges) constraint matrix. The algorithm is a non-recursive algorithm; even though it runs in time rather than time (given an oracle for the so-called statistical leverage scores), it is extremely simple; and it can be used to compute an approximate solution with a direct solver. In light of this result, our second result is a straightforward connection between the concept of graph resistance (which has proven useful in recent algorithms for linear equation solvers) and the concept of statistical leverage (which has proven useful in numerically-implementable randomized algorithms for large matrix problems and which has a natural data-analytic interpretation).',

	{'abstract': u'In this work I study a modified Tower of Hanoi puzzle, which I term Magnetic Tower of Hanoi (MToH). The original Tower of Hanoi puzzle, invented by the French mathematician Edouard Lucas in 1883, spans "base 2". That is - the number of moves of disk number k is 2^(k-1), and the total number of moves required to solve the puzzle with N disks is 2^N - 1. In the MToH puzzle, each disk has two distinct-color sides, and disks must be flipped and placed so that no sides of the same color meet. I show here that the MToH puzzle spans "base 3" - the number of moves required to solve an N+1 disk puzzle is essentially three times larger than he number of moves required to solve an N disk puzzle. The MToH comes in 3 flavors which differ in the rules for placing a disk on a free post and therefore differ in the possible evolutions of the Tower states towards a puzzle solution. I analyze here algorithms for minimizing the number of steps required to solve the MToH puzzle in its different versions. Thus, while the colorful Magnetic Tower of Hanoi puzzle is rather challenging, its inherent freedom nurtures mathematics with remarkable elegance.',

	{'abstract': u'Frequent Episode Discovery framework is a popular framework in Temporal Data Mining with many applications. Over the years many different notions of frequencies of episodes have been proposed along with different algorithms for episode discovery. In this paper we present a unified view of all such frequency counting algorithms. We present a generic algorithm such that all current algorithms are special cases of it. This unified view allows one to gain insights into different frequencies and we present quantitative relationships among different frequencies. Our unified view also helps in obtaining correctness proofs for various algorithms as we show here. We also point out how this unified view helps us to consider generalization of the algorithm so that they can discover episodes with general partial orders.',

	{'abstract': u'Recently, many techniques have been introduced that allow the (automated) classification of the runtime complexity of term rewrite systems (TRSs for short). In earlier work, the authors have shown that for confluent TRSs, innermost polynomial runtime complexity induces polytime computability of the functions defined. In this paper, we generalise the above result to full rewriting. Following our previous work, we exploit graph rewriting. We give a new proof of the adequacy of graph rewriting for full rewriting that allows for a precise control of the resources copied. In sum we completely describe an implementation of rewriting on a Turing machine (TM for short). We show that the runtime complexity of the TRS and the runtime complexity of the TM is polynomially related. Our result strengthens the evidence that the complexity of a rewrite system is truthfully represented through the length of derivations. Moreover our result allows the classification of non-deterministic polytime-computation based on runtime complexity analysis of rewrite systems.',

	{'abstract': u'In some underwater sensor networks, sensor nodes may be deployed at various depths of an ocean making those networks three-dimensional (3D). While most terrestrial sensor networks can usually be modeled as two dimensional (2D) networks, these underwater sensor networks must be modeled as 3D networks. This leads to new research challenges in the area of network architecture and topology. In this paper, we present two different network architectures for 3D underwater sensor networks. The first one is a hierarchical architecture that uses a relatively small number of robust backbone nodes to create the network where a large number of inexpensive sensors communicate with their nearest backbone nodes, and packets from a backbone node to the sink is routed through other backbone nodes. This hierarchical approach allows creating a network of smaller number of expensive backbone nodes while keeping the mobile sensors simple and inexpensive. Along with network topology, we also study energy efficiency and frequency reuse issues for such 3D networks. The second approach is a nonhierarchical architecture which assumes that all nodes are identical and randomly deployed. It partitions the whole 3D network space into identical cells and keeps one node active in each cell such that sensing coverage and connectivity are maintained while limiting the energy consumed. We also study closeness to optimality of our proposed scheme.',

	{'abstract': u'We study the problem of scheduling periodic real-time tasks so as to meet their individual minimum reward requirements. A task generates jobs that can be given arbitrary service times before their deadlines. A task then obtains rewards based on the service times received by its jobs. We show that this model is compatible to the imprecise computation models and the increasing reward with increasing service models. In contrast to previous work on these models, which mainly focus on maximize the total reward in the system, we aim to fulfill different reward requirements by different tasks, which offers better fairness and allows fine-grained tradeoff between tasks. We first derive a necessary and sufficient condition for a system, along with reward requirements of tasks, to be feasible. We also obtain an off-line feasibility optimal scheduling policy. We then studies a sufficient condition for a policy to be feasibility optimal or achieves some approximation bound. This condition can serve as a guideline for designing on-line scheduling policy and we obtains a greedy policy based on it. We prove that the on-line policy is feasibility optimal when all tasks have the same periods and also obtain an approximation bound for the policy under general cases.',

	{'abstract': u"This document consists of two parts: the second part was submitted earlier as a new proof of Nash's theorem, and the first part is a note explaining a problem found in that proof. We are indebted to Sergiu Hart and Eran Shmaya for their careful study which led to their simultaneous discovery of this error. So far the error has not been fixed, but many of the results and techniques of the paper remain valid, so we will continue to make it available online. Abstract for the original paper: We give a novel proof of the existence of Nash equilibria in all finite games without using fixed point theorems or path following arguments. Our approach relies on a new notion intermediate between Nash and correlated equilibria called exchangeable equilibria, which are correlated equilibria with certain symmetry and factorization properties. We prove these exist by a duality argument, using Hart and Schmeidler's proof of correlated equilibrium existence as a first step. In an appropriate limit exchangeable equilibria converge to the convex hull of Nash equilibria, proving that these exist as well. Exchangeable equilibria are defined in terms of symmetries of the game, so this method automatically proves the stronger statement that a symmetric game has a symmetric Nash equilibrium. The case without symmetries follows by a symmetrization argument.",

	{'abstract': u'The mutual information between a complex-valued channel input and its complex-valued output is decomposed into four parts based on polar coordinates: an amplitude term, a phase term, and two mixed terms. Numerical results for the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel with various inputs show that, at high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), the amplitude and phase terms dominate the mixed terms. For the AWGN channel with a Gaussian input, analytical expressions are derived for high SNR. The decomposition method is applied to partially coherent channels and a property of such channels called "spectral loss" is developed. Spectral loss occurs in nonlinear fiber-optic channels and it may be one effect that needs to be taken into account to explain the behavior of the capacity of nonlinear fiber-optic channels presented in recent studies.',

	{'abstract': u"The establishment of trust relationships to a computing platform relies on validation processes. Validation allows an external entity to build trust in the expected behaviour of the platform based on provided evidence of the platform's configuration. In a process like remote attestation, the 'trusted' platform submits verification data created during a start up process. These data consist of hardware-protected values of platform configuration registers, containing nested measurement values, e.g., hash values, of loaded or started components. Commonly, the register values are created in linear order by a hardware-secured operation. Fine-grained diagnosis of components, based on the linear order of verification data and associated measurement logs, is not optimal. We propose a method to use tree-formed verification data to validate a platform. Component measurement values represent leaves, and protected registers represent roots of a hash tree. We describe the basic mechanism of validating a platform using tree-formed measurement logs and root registers and show an logarithmic speed-up for the search of faults.

	{'abstract': u'Although a lot of research has taken place in Object Oriented Design of software for Real Time systems and mapping of design models to implementation models, these methodologies are applicable to systems which are less complex and small in source code size. However, in practice, the size of the software for real time applications is growing. The run time architecture of real time applications is becoming increasingly complex. In this paper, we present a generic approach for mapping the design models to run time architectures resulting in combination of processes and threads. This method is applied in development of a communication subsystem of C4I complex and shall be presented as a case study.',

	{'abstract': u'A coding scheme is proposed for the memoryless Gaussian broadcast channel with correlated noises and feedback. For all noise correlations other than -1, the gap between the sum-rate the scheme achieves and the full-cooperation bound vanishes as the signal-to-noise ratio tends to infinity. When the correlation coefficient is -1, the gains afforded by feedback are unbounded and the prelog is doubled. When the correlation coefficient is +1 we demonstrate a dichotomy: If the noise variances are equal, then feedback is useless, and otherwise, feedback affords unbounded rate gains and doubles the prelog. The unbounded feedback gains, however, require perfect (noiseless) feedback. When the feedback links are noisy the feedback gains are bounded, unless the feedback noise decays to zero sufficiently fast with the signal-to-noise ratio. Extensions to more receivers are also discussed as is the memoryless Gaussian interference channel with feedback.',

	{'abstract': u'As known, physical circuits, e.g. integrated circuits or power system, work in a distributed manner, but these circuits could not be easily simulated in a distributed way. This is mainly because that the dynamical system of physical circuits is nonlinear and the linearized system of physical circuits is nonsymmetrical. This paper proposes a simple and natural strategy to mimic the distributed behavior of the physical circuit by mimicking the distributed behavior of the internal wires inside this circuit. Mimic Transmission Method (MTM) is a new distributed algorithm to solve the nonlinear ordinary differential equations extracted from physical circuits. It maps the transmission delay of interconnects between subcircuits to the communication delay of digital data link between processors. MTM is a black-box algorithm. By mimicking the transmission lines, MTM seals the nonlinear dynamical system within the subcircuit. As the result, we do not need to pay attention on how to solve the nonlinear dynamic system or nonsymmetrical linear system in parallel. MTM is a global direct algorithm, and it does only one distributed computation at each time window to obtain accurate result, so unconvergence issues do not need to be worried about.',

	{'abstract': u'In this paper we characterize and construct novel oversampled filter banks implementing fusion frames. A fusion frame is a sequence of orthogonal projection operators whose sum can be inverted in a numerically stable way. When properly designed, fusion frames can provide redundant encodings of signals which are optimally robust against certain types of noise and erasures. However, up to this point, few implementable constructions of such frames were known; we show how to construct them using oversampled filter banks. In this work, we first provide polyphase domain characterizations of filter bank fusion frames. We then use these characterizations to construct filter bank fusion frame versions of discrete wavelet and Gabor transforms, emphasizing those specific finite impulse response filters whose frequency responses are well-behaved.',

	{'abstract': u'In this work we investigate a novel approach to handle the challenges of face recognition, which includes rotation, scale, occlusion, illumination etc. Here, we have used thermal face images as those are capable to minimize the affect of illumination changes and occlusion due to moustache, beards, adornments etc. The proposed approach registers the training and testing thermal face images in polar coordinate, which is capable to handle complicacies introduced by scaling and rotation. Line features are extracted from thermal polar images and feature vectors are constructed using these line. Feature vectors thus obtained passes through principal component analysis (PCA) for the dimensionality reduction of feature vectors. Finally, the images projected into eigenspace are classified using a multi-layer perceptron. In the experiments we have used Object Tracking and Classification Beyond Visible Spectrum (OTCBVS) database. Experimental results show that the proposed approach significantly improves the verification and identification performance and the success rate is 99.25%.',

In case of a real life scenario, most of existing methods fail to properly binarize the image of a vehicle in a congested road, captured through a CCD camera. In the current work we have applied histogram equalization technique over the complete image and also over different hierarchy of image partitioning. A novel scheme is formulated for giving the membership value to each pixel for each hierarchy of histogram equalization. Then the image is binarized depending on the net membership value of each pixel. The technique is exhaustively evaluated on the vehicle image dataset as well as the license plate dataset, giving satisfactory performances.',

	{'abstract': u'The stable marriage problem has a wide variety of practical applications, ranging from matching resident doctors to hospitals, to matching students to schools, or more generally to any two-sided market. We consider a useful variation of the stable marriage problem, where the men and women express their preferences using a preference list with ties over a subset of the members of the other sex. Matchings are permitted only with people who appear in these preference lists. In this setting, we study the problem of finding a stable matching that marries as many people as possible. Stability is an envy-free notion: no man and woman who are not married to each other would both prefer each other to their partners or to being single. This problem is NP-hard. We tackle this problem using local search, exploiting properties of the problem to reduce the size of the neighborhood and to make local moves efficiently. Experimental results show that this approach is able to solve large problems, quickly returning stable matchings of large and often optimal size.',

An automated Red Light Violation Detection System (RLVDS) is an integral part of the ITMS. In our present work we have designed and developed a complete system for generating the list of all stop-line violating vehicle images automatically from video snapshots of road-side surveillance cameras. The system first generates adaptive background images for each camera view, subtracts captured images from the corresponding background images and analyses potential occlusions over the stop-line in a traffic signal. Considering round-the-clock operations in a real-life test environment, the developed system could successfully track 92% images of vehicles with violations on the stop-line in a "Red" traffic signal.',

	{'abstract': u'In this paper we present a simple novel approach to tackle the challenges of scaling and rotation of face images in face recognition. The proposed approach registers the training and testing visual face images by log-polar transformation, which is capable to handle complicacies introduced by scaling and rotation. Log-polar images are projected into eigenspace and finally classified using an improved multi-layer perceptron. In the experiments we have used ORL face database and Object Tracking and Classification Beyond Visible Spectrum (OTCBVS) database for visual face images. Experimental results show that the proposed approach significantly improves the recognition performances from visual to log-polar-visual face images. In case of ORL face database, recognition rate for visual face images is 89.5% and that is increased to 97.5% for log-polar-visual face images whereas for OTCBVS face database recognition rate for visual images is 87.84% and 96.36% for log-polar-visual face images.',

	{'abstract': u'To understand the network response to large-scale physical attacks, we investigate the asymptotic capacity of a half-duplex fading relay network with random node failures when the number of relays is infinitely large. In this paper, a simplified independent attack model is assumed where each relay node fails with a certain probability. The noncoherent relaying scheme is considered, which corresponds to the case of zero forward-link channel state information (CSI) at the relays. Accordingly, the whole relay network can be shown equivalent to a Rayleigh fading channel, where we derive the -outage capacity upper bound according to the multiple access (MAC) cut-set, and the -outage achievable rates for both the amplify-and-forward (AF) and decode-and-forward (DF) strategies. Furthermore, we show that the DF strategy is asymptotically optimal as the outage probability goes to zero, with the AF strategy strictly suboptimal over all signal to noise ratio (SNR) regimes. Regarding the rate loss due to random attacks, the AF strategy suffers a less portion of rate loss than the DF strategy in the high SNR regime, while the DF strategy demonstrates more robust performance in the low SNR regime.',

	{'abstract': u'This paper presents a concept of image pixel fusion of visual and thermal faces, which can significantly improve the overall performance of a face recognition system. Several factors affect face recognition performance including pose variations, facial expression changes, occlusions, and most importantly illumination changes. So, image pixel fusion of thermal and visual images is a solution to overcome the drawbacks present in the individual thermal and visual face images. Fused images are projected into eigenspace and finally classified using a multi-layer perceptron. In the experiments we have used Object Tracking and Classification Beyond Visible Spectrum (OTCBVS) database benchmark thermal and visual face images. Experimental results show that the proposed approach significantly improves the verification and identification performance and the success rate is 95.07%. The main objective of employing fusion is to produce a fused image that provides the most detailed and reliable information. Fusion of multiple images together produces a more efficient representation of the image.',

	{'abstract': u'Traditionally, the performance of ocr algorithms and systems is based on the recognition of isolated characters. When a system classifies an individual character, its output is typically a character label or a reject marker that corresponds to an unrecognized character. By comparing output labels with the correct labels, the number of correct recognition, substitution errors misrecognized characters, and rejects unrecognized characters are determined. Nowadays, although recognition of printed isolated characters is performed with high accuracy, recognition of handwritten characters still remains an open problem in the research arena. The ability to identify machine printed characters in an automated or a semi automated manner has obvious applications in numerous fields. Since creating an algorithm with a one hundred percent correct recognition rate is quite probably impossible in our world of noise and different font styles, it is important to design character recognition algorithms with these failures in mind so that when mistakes are inevitably made, they will at least be understandable and predictable to the person working with the',

	{'abstract': u'In this article, we proposed a Variable threshold MOSFET(VTMOS)approach which is realized from Dynamic Threshold MOSFET(DTMOS), suitable for sub-threshold digital circuit operation. Basically the principle of sub- threshold logics is operating MOSFET in sub-threshold region and using the leakage current in that region for switching action, there by drastically decreasing power. To reduce the power consumption of sub-threshold circuits further, a novel body biasing technique termed VTMOS is introduced .VTMOS approach is realized from DTMOS approach. Dynamic threshold MOS (DTMOS) circuits provide low leakage and high current drive, compared to CMOS circuits, operated at lower voltages. The VTMOS is based on operating the MOS devices with an appropriate substrate bias which varies with gate voltage, by connecting a positive bias voltage between gate and substrate for NMOS and negative bias voltage between gate and substrate for PMOS. With VTMOS, there is a considerable reduction in operating current and power dissipation, while the remaining characteristics are almost the same as those of DTMOS. Results of our investigations show that VTMOS circuits improves the power up to 50% when compared to CMOS and DTMOS circuits, in sub- threshold region.. The performance analysis and comparison of VTMOS, DTMOS and CMOS is made and test results of Power dissipation, Propagation delay and Power delay product are presented to justify the superiority of VTMOS logic over conventional sub-threshold logics using Hspice Tool. The dependency of these parameters on frequency of operation has also been investigated.',

	{'abstract': u'We examine the relationship between the algebraic lambda-calculus, a fragment of the differential lambda-calculus and the linear-algebraic lambda-calculus, a candidate lambda-calculus for quantum computation. Both calculi are algebraic: each one is equipped with an additive and a scalar-multiplicative structure, and their set of terms is closed under linear combinations. However, the two languages were built using different approaches: the former is a call-by-name language whereas the latter is call-by-value; the former considers algebraic equalities whereas the latter approaches them through rewrite rules. In this paper, we analyse how these different approaches relate to one another. To this end, we propose four canonical languages based on each of the possible choices: call-by-name versus call-by-value, algebraic equality versus algebraic rewriting. We show that the various languages simulate one another. Due to subtle interaction between beta-reduction and algebraic rewriting, to make the languages consistent some additional hypotheses such as confluence or normalisation might be required. We carefully devise the required properties for each proof, making them general enough to be valid for any sub-language satisfying the corresponding properties.',

	{'abstract': u'We study the problem of clock synchronization in highly dynamic networks, where communication links can appear or disappear at any time. The nodes in the network are equipped with hardware clocks, but the rate of the hardware clocks can vary arbitrarily within specific bounds, and the estimates that nodes can obtain about the clock values of other nodes are inherently inaccurate. Our goal in this setting is to output a logical clock at each node, such that the logical clocks of any two nodes are not too far apart, and nodes that remain close to each other in the network for a long time are better synchronized than distant nodes. This property is called gradient clock synchronization. Gradient clock synchronization has been widely studied in the static setting, where the network topology does not change. We show that the asymptotically optimal bounds obtained for the static case also apply to our highly dynamic setting: if two nodes remain at distance d from each other for sufficiently long, it is possible to upper bound the difference between their clock values by O(d*log(D/d)), where D is the diameter of the network. This is known to be optimal for static networks, and since a static network is a special case of a dynamic network, it is optimal for dynamic networks as well. Furthermore, we show that our algorithm has optimal stabilization time: when a path of length d appears between two nodes, the time required until the clock skew between the two nodes is reduced to O(d*log(D/d)) is O(D), which we prove is optimal.',

Out of several factors, which affect face recognition performance in case of visual images, illumination changes are a significant factor that needs to be addressed. Thermal images are better in handling illumination conditions but not very consistent in capturing texture details of the faces. Other factors like sunglasses, beard, moustache etc also play active role in adding complicacies to the recognition process. Fusion of thermal and visual images is a solution to overcome the drawbacks present in the individual thermal and visual face images. Here fused images are projected into an eigenspace and the projected images are classified using a radial basis function (RBF) neural network and also by a multi-layer perceptron (MLP). In the experiments Object Tracking and Classification Beyond Visible Spectrum (OTCBVS) database benchmark for thermal and visual face images have been used. Comparison of experimental results show that the proposed approach performs significantly well in recognizing face images with a success rate of 96% and 95.07% for RBF Neural Network and MLP respectively.',

	{'abstract': u'The success of several constraint-based modeling languages such as OPL, ZINC, or COMET, appeals for better software engineering practices, particularly in the testing phase. This paper introduces a testing framework enabling automated test case generation for constraint programming. We propose a general framework of constraint program development which supposes that a first declarative and simple constraint model is available from the problem specifications analysis. Then, this model is refined using classical techniques such as constraint reformulation, surrogate and global constraint addition, or symmetry-breaking to form an improved constraint model that must be thoroughly tested before being used to address real-sized problems. We think that most of the faults are introduced in this refinement step and propose a process which takes the first declarative model as an oracle for detecting non-conformities. We derive practical test purposes from this process to generate automatically test data that exhibit non-conformities. We implemented this approach in a new tool called CPTEST that was used to automatically detect non-conformities on two classical benchmark programs, namely the Golomb rulers and the car-sequencing problem.',

	{'abstract': u'Artificial neural networks have already shown their success in face recognition and similar complex pattern recognition tasks. However, a major disadvantage of the technique is that it is extremely slow during training for larger classes and hence not suitable for real-time complex problems such as pattern recognition. This is an attempt to develop a parallel framework for the training algorithm of a perceptron. In this paper, two general architectures for a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) have been demonstrated. The first architecture is All-Class-in-One-Network (ACON) where all the classes are placed in a single network and the second one is One-Class-in-One-Network (OCON) where an individual single network is responsible for each and every class. Capabilities of these two architectures were compared and verified in solving human face recognition, which is a complex pattern recognition task where several factors affect the recognition performance like pose variations, facial expression changes, occlusions, and most importantly illumination changes. Both the structures were implemented and tested for face recognition purpose and experimental results show that the OCON structure performs better than the generally used ACON ones in term of training convergence speed of the network. Unlike the conventional sequential approach of training the neural networks, the OCON technique may be implemented by training all the classes of the face images simultaneously.',

The objective of this paper is to develop an agent-based model to simulate the spread of pandemic influenza (novel H1N1) in Egypt. The proposed multi-agent model is based on the modeling of individuals' interactions in a space time context. The proposed model involves different types of parameters such as: social agent attributes, distribution of Egypt population, and patterns of agents' interactions. Analysis of modeling results leads to understanding the characteristics of the modeled pandemic, transmission patterns, and the conditions under which an outbreak might occur. In addition, the proposed model is used to measure the effectiveness of different control strategies to intervene the pandemic spread.",

The main operational issue in this model is that of deciding which queues to serve, subject to certain constraints. In this paper, we study qualitative performance properties of the well known -weighted scheduling policies. The stability, in the sense of positive recurrence, of these policies has been well understood. We establish exponential upper bounds on the tail of the steady-state distribution of the backlog. Along the way, we prove finiteness of the expected steady-state backlog when , a property that was known only for .

Computation of the minimum probability of error which is attained by the maximum a-posteriori probability (MAP) criterion is usually not tractable. The new classes are derived using Holder's inequality and reverse Holder's inequality. The bounds in these classes provide good prediction of the minimum probability of error in multiple hypothesis testing. The new classes generalize and extend existing bounds and their relation to some existing upper bounds is presented. It is shown that the tightest bounds in these classes asymptotically coincide with the optimum probability of error provided by the MAP criterion for binary or multiple hypothesis testing problem. These bounds are compared with other existing lower bounds in several typical detection and classification problems in terms of tightness and computational complexity.",

	{'abstract': u'Linear receivers are often used to reduce the implementation complexity of multiple-antenna systems. In a traditional linear receiver architecture, the receive antennas are used to separate out the codewords sent by each transmit antenna, which can then be decoded individually. Although easy to implement, this approach can be highly suboptimal when the channel matrix is near singular. This paper develops a new linear receiver architecture that uses the receive antennas to create an effective channel matrix with integer-valued entries. Rather than attempting to recover transmitted codewords directly, the decoder recovers integer combinations of the codewords according to the entries of the effective channel matrix. The codewords are all generated using the same linear code which guarantees that these integer combinations are themselves codewords. Provided that the effective channel is full rank, these integer combinations can then be digitally solved for the original codewords. This paper focuses on the special case where there is no coding across transmit antennas and no channel state information at the transmitter(s), which corresponds either to a multi-user uplink scenario or to single-user V-BLAST encoding. In this setting, the proposed integer-forcing linear receiver significantly outperforms conventional linear architectures such as the zero-forcing and linear MMSE receiver. In the high SNR regime, the proposed receiver attains the optimal diversity-multiplexing tradeoff for the standard MIMO channel with no coding across transmit antennas. It is further shown that in an extended MIMO model with interference, the integer-forcing linear receiver achieves the optimal generalized degrees-of-freedom.',

Here, Daubechies wavelet transform, called as D2, coefficients from visual and corresponding coefficients computed in the same manner from thermal images are combined to get fused coefficients. After decomposition up to fifth level (Level 5) fusion of coefficients is done. Inverse Daubechies wavelet transform of those coefficients gives us fused face images. The main advantage of using wavelet transform is that it is well-suited to manage different image resolution and allows the image decomposition in different kinds of coefficients, while preserving the image information. Fused images thus found are passed through Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for reduction of dimensions and then those reduced fused images are classified using a multi-layer perceptron. For experiments IRIS Thermal/Visual Face Database was used. Experimental results show that the performance of the approach presented here achieves maximum success rate of 100% in many cases.',

	{'abstract': u'Contextual bandit algorithms have become popular for online recommendation systems such as Digg, Yahoo! Buzz, and news recommendation in general. emph evaluation of the effectiveness of new algorithms in these applications is critical for protecting online user experiences but very challenging due to their "partial-label" nature. Common practice is to create a simulator which simulates the online environment for the problem at hand and then run an algorithm against this simulator. However, creating simulator itself is often difficult and modeling bias is usually unavoidably introduced. In this paper, we introduce a emph methodology for contextual bandit algorithm evaluation. Different from simulator-based approaches, our method is completely data-driven and very easy to adapt to different applications. More importantly, our method can provide provably unbiased evaluations. Our empirical results on a large-scale news article recommendation dataset collected from Yahoo! Front Page conform well with our theoretical results. Furthermore, comparisons between our offline replay and online bucket evaluation of several contextual bandit algorithms show accuracy and effectiveness of our offline evaluation method.',

	{'abstract': u'This paper investigates the multiresolution level-1 and level-2 Quotient based Fusion of thermal and visual images. In the proposed system, the method-1 namely "Decompose then Quotient Fuse Level-1" and the method-2 namely "Decompose-Reconstruct then Quotient Fuse Level-2" both work on wavelet transformations of the visual and thermal face images. The wavelet transform is well-suited to manage different image resolution and allows the image decomposition in different kinds of coefficients, while preserving the image information without any loss. This approach is based on a definition of an illumination invariant signature image which enables an analytic generation of the image space with varying illumination. The quotient fused images are passed through Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimension reduction and then those images are classified using a multi-layer perceptron (MLP). The performances of both the methods have been evaluated using OTCBVS and IRIS databases. All the different classes have been tested separately, among them the maximum recognition result is 100%.',

	{'abstract': u'An important aspect of the Future Internet is the efficient utilization of (wireless) network resources. In order for the - demanding in terms of QoS - Future Internet services to be provided, the current trend is evolving towards an "integrated" wireless network access model that enables users to enjoy mobility, seamless access and high quality of service in an all-IP network on an "Anytime, Anywhere" basis. The term "integrated" is used to denote that the Future Internet wireless "last mile" is expected to comprise multiple heterogeneous geographically coexisting wireless networks, each having different capacity and coverage radius. The efficient management of the wireless access network resources is crucial due to their scarcity that renders wireless access a potential bottleneck for the provision of high quality services. In this paper we propose an auction mechanism for allocating the bandwidth of such a network so that efficiency is attained, i.e. social welfare is maximized. In particular, we propose an incentive-compatible, efficient auction-based mechanism of low computational complexity. We define a repeated game to address user utilities and incentives issues. Subsequently, we extend this mechanism so that it can also accommodate multicast sessions. We also analyze the computational complexity and message overhead of the proposed mechanism. We then show how user bids can be replaced from weights generated by the network and transform the auction to a cooperative mechanism capable of prioritizing certain classes of services and emulating DiffServ and time-of-day pricing schemes. The theoretical analysis is complemented by simulations that assess the proposed mechanisms properties and performance. We finally provide some concluding remarks and directions for future research.',

	{'abstract': u"The lambda calculus, subject to typing restrictions, provides a syntax for the internal language of cartesian closed categories. This paper establishes a parallel result: staging annotations, subject to named level restrictions, provide a syntax for the internal language of Freyd categories, which are known to be in bijective correspondence with Arrows. The connection is made by interpreting multi-stage type systems as indexed functors from polynomial categories to their reindexings. This result applies only to multi-stage languages which are (1) homogeneous, (2) allow cross-stage persistence and (3) place no restrictions on the use of structural rules in typing derivations. Removing these restrictions and repeating the construction yields generalized arrows, of which Arrows are a particular case. A translation from well-typed multi-stage programs to single-stage GArrow terms is provided. The translation is defined by induction on the structure of the proof that the multi-stage program is well-typed, relying on information encoded in the proof's use of structural rules. Metalanguage designers can now factor out the syntactic machinery of metaprogramming by providing a single translation from staging syntax into expressions of generalized arrow type. Object language providers need only implement the functions of the generalized arrow type class in point-free style. Object language users may write metaprograms over these object languages in a point-ful style, using the same binding, scoping, abstraction, and application mechanisms in both the object language and metalanguage. This paper's principal contributions are the GArrow definition of Figures 2 and 3, the translation in Figure 5 and the category-theoretic semantics of Definition 16. An accompanying Coq proof formalizes the type system, translation procedure, and key theorems.",

	{'abstract': u'Energy parity games are infinite two-player turn-based games played on weighted graphs. The objective of the game combines a (qualitative) parity condition with the (quantitative) requirement that the sum of the weights (i.e., the level of energy in the game) must remain positive. Beside their own interest in the design and synthesis of resource-constrained omega-regular specifications, energy parity games provide one of the simplest model of games with combined qualitative and quantitative objective. Our main results are as follows: (a) exponential memory is necessary and sufficient for winning strategies in energy parity games; (b) the problem of deciding the winner in energy parity games can be solved in NP cap coNP; and (c) we give an algorithm to solve energy parity by reduction to energy games. We also show that the problem of deciding the winner in energy parity games is polynomially equivalent to the problem of deciding the winner in mean-payoff parity games, while optimal strategies may require infinite memory in mean-payoff parity games. As a consequence we obtain a conceptually simple algorithm to solve mean-payoff parity games.',

	{'abstract': u'For stationary wireless ad hoc networks, one of the key challenging issues in routing and multicasting is to conserve as much energy as possible without compromising path efficiency measured as end-to-end delay. In this paper, we address the problem of path efficient and energy aware multicasting in static wireless ad hoc networks. We propose a novel distributed scalable algorithm for finding a virtual multicast backbone (VMB). Based on this VMB, we have further developed a multicasting scheme that jointly improves path efficiency and energy conservation. By exploiting inherent broadcast advantage of wireless communication and employing a more realistic energy consumption model for wireless communication which not only depends on radio propagation losses but also on energy losses in transceiver circuitry, our simulation results show that the proposed VMB-based multicasting scheme outperforms existing prominent tree based energy conserving, path efficient multicasting schemes.',

	{'abstract': u'Models for noncoherent error control in random linear network coding (RLNC) and store and forward (SAF) have been recently proposed. In this paper, we model different types of random network communications as the transmission of flats of matroids. This novel framework encompasses RLNC and SAF and allows us to introduce a novel protocol, referred to as random affine network coding (RANC), based on affine combinations of packets. Although the models previously proposed for RLNC and SAF only consider error control, using our framework, we first evaluate and compare the performance of different network protocols in the error-free case. We define and determine the rate, average delay, and throughput of such protocols, and we also investigate the possibilities of partial decoding before the entire message is received. We thus show that RANC outperforms RLNC in terms of data rate and throughput thanks to a more efficient encoding of messages into packets. Second, we model the possible alterations of a message by the network as an operator channel, which generalizes the channels proposed for RLNC and SAF. Error control is thus reduced to a coding-theoretic problem on flats of a matroid, where two distinct metrics can be used for error correction. We study the maximum cardinality of codes on flats in general, and codes for error correction in RANC in particular. We finally design a class of nearly optimal codes for RANC based on rank metric codes for which we propose a low-complexity decoding algorithm. The gain of RANC over RLNC is thus preserved with no additional cost in terms of complexity.',

	{'abstract': u'The importance of stochasticity within biological systems has been shown repeatedly during the last years and has raised the need for efficient stochastic tools. We present SABRE, a tool for stochastic analysis of biochemical reaction networks. SABRE implements fast adaptive uniformization (FAU), a direct numerical approximation algorithm for computing transient solutions of biochemical reaction networks. Biochemical reactions networks represent biological systems studied at a molecular level and these reactions can be modeled as transitions of a Markov chain. SABRE accepts as input the formalism of guarded commands, which it interprets either as continuous-time or as discrete-time Markov chains. Besides operating in a stochastic mode, SABRE may also perform a deterministic analysis by directly computing a mean-field approximation of the system under study. We illustrate the different functionalities of SABRE by means of biological case studies.',

	{'abstract': u'We consider the detection of correlated information sources in the ubiquitous Code-Division Multiple-Access (CDMA) scheme. We propose a message-passing based scheme for detecting correlated sources directly, with no need for source coding. The detection is done simultaneously over a block of transmitted binary symbols (word). Simulation results are provided demonstrating a substantial improvement in bit-error-rate in comparison with the unmodified detector and the alternative of source compression. The robustness of the error-performance improvement is shown under practical model settings, including wrong estimation of the generating Markov transition matrix and finite-length spreading codes.',

	{'abstract': u'Symmetry can be used to help solve many problems. For instance, Einstein\'s famous 1905 paper ("On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies") uses symmetry to help derive the laws of special relativity. In artificial intelligence, symmetry has played an important role in both problem representation and reasoning. I describe recent work on using symmetry to help solve constraint satisfaction problems. Symmetries occur within individual solutions of problems as well as between different solutions of the same problem. Symmetry can also be applied to the constraints in a problem to give new symmetric constraints. Reasoning about symmetry can speed up problem solving, and has led to the discovery of new results in both graph and number theory.',

	{'abstract': u'Many distributed systems can be modeled as network games: a collection of selfish players that communicate in order to maximize their individual utilities. The performance of such games can be evaluated through the costs of the system equilibria: the system states in which no player can increase her utility by unilaterally changing her behavior. However, assuming that all players are selfish and in particular that all players have the same utility function may not always be appropriate. Hence, several extensions to incorporate also altruistic and malicious behavior in addition to selfishness have been proposed over the last years. In this paper, we seek to go one step further and study arbitrary relationships between participants. In particular, we introduce the notion of the social range matrix and explore the effects of the social range matrix on the equilibria in a network game. In order to derive concrete results, we propose a simplistic network creation game that captures the effect of social relationships among players.',

	{'abstract': u'We study decompositions of the global NVALUE constraint. Our main contribution is theoretical: we show that there are propagators for global constraints like NVALUE which decomposition can simulate with the same time complexity but with a much greater space complexity. This suggests that the benefit of a global propagator may often not be in saving time but in saving space. Our other theoretical contribution is to show for the first time that range consistency can be enforced on NVALUE with the same worst-case time complexity as bound consistency. Finally, the decompositions we study are readily encoded as linear inequalities. We are therefore able to use them in integer linear programs.',

	{'abstract': u'We consider the Linear Programming (LP) solution of the Compressed Sensing (CS) problem over reals, also known as the Basis Pursuit (BasP) algorithm. The BasP allows interpretation as a channel-coding problem, and it guarantees error-free reconstruction with a properly chosen measurement matrix and sufficiently sparse error vectors. In this manuscript, we examine how the BasP performs on a given measurement matrix and develop an algorithm to discover the sparsest vectors for which the BasP fails. The resulting algorithm is a generalization of our previous results on finding the most probable error-patterns degrading performance of a finite size Low-Density Parity-Check (LDPC) code in the error-floor regime. The BasP fails when its output is different from the actual error-pattern. We design a CS-Instanton Search Algorithm (ISA) generating a sparse vector, called a CS-instanton, such that the BasP fails on the CS-instanton, while the BasP recovery is successful for any modification of the CS-instanton replacing a nonzero element by zero. We also prove that, given a sufficiently dense random input for the error-vector, the CS-ISA converges to an instanton in a small finite number of steps. The performance of the CS-ISA is illustrated on a randomly generated matrix. For this example, the CS-ISA outputs the shortest instanton (error vector) pattern of length 11.',

	{'abstract': u'We consider a common type of symmetry where we have a matrix of decision variables with interchangeable rows and columns. A simple and efficient method to deal with such row and column symmetry is to post symmetry breaking constraints like DOUBLELEX and SNAKELEX. We provide a number of positive and negative results on posting such symmetry breaking constraints. On the positive side, we prove that we can compute in polynomial time a unique representative of an equivalence class in a matrix model with row and column symmetry if the number of rows (or of columns) is bounded and in a number of other special cases. On the negative side, we show that whilst DOUBLELEX and SNAKELEX are often effective in practice, they can leave a large number of symmetric solutions in the worst case. In addition, we prove that propagating DOUBLELEX completely is NP-hard. Finally we consider how to break row, column and value symmetry, correcting a result in the literature about the safeness of combining different symmetry breaking constraints. We end with the first experimental study on how much symmetry is left by DOUBLELEX and SNAKELEX on some benchmark problems.',

	{'abstract': u'We consider how local and global decision policies interact in stopping time problems such as quickest time change detection. Individual agents make myopic local decisions via social learning, that is, each agent records a private observation of a noisy underlying state process, selfishly optimizes its local utility and then broadcasts its local decision. Given these local decisions, how can a global decision maker achieve quickest time change detection when the underlying state changes according to a phase-type distribution? The paper presents four results. First, using Blackwell dominance of measures, it is shown that the optimal cost incurred in social learning based quickest detection is always larger than that of classical quickest detection. Second, it is shown that in general the optimal decision policy for social learning based quickest detection is characterized by multiple thresholds within the space of Bayesian distributions. Third, using lattice programming and stochastic dominance, sufficient conditions are given for the optimal decision policy to consist of a single linear hyperplane, or, more generally, a threshold curve. Estimation of the optimal linear approximation to this threshold curve is formulated as a simulation-based stochastic optimization problem. Finally, the paper shows that in multi-agent sensor management with quickest detection, where each agent views the world according to its prior, the optimal policy has a similar structure to social learning.',

	{'abstract': u'Sigma-Delta modulation is a popular method for analog-to-digital conversion of bandlimited signals that employs coarse quantization coupled with oversampling. The standard mathematical model for the error analysis of the method measures the performance of a given scheme by the rate at which the associated reconstruction error decays as a function of the oversampling ratio . It was recently shown that exponential accuracy of the form can be achieved by appropriate one-bit Sigma-Delta modulation schemes. By general information-entropy arguments must be less than 1. The current best known value for is approximately 0.088. The schemes that were designed to achieve this accuracy employ the "greedy" quantization rule coupled with feedback filters that fall into a class we call "minimally supported". In this paper, we study the minimization problem that corresponds to optimizing the error decay rate for this class of feedback filters. We solve a relaxed version of this problem exactly and provide explicit asymptotics of the solutions. From these relaxed solutions, we find asymptotically optimal solutions of the original problem, which improve the best known exponential error decay rate to . Our method draws from the theory of orthogonal polynomials; in particular, it relates the optimal filters to the zero sets of Chebyshev polynomials of the second kind.',

	{'abstract': u'Inspired by online ad allocation, we study online stochastic packing linear programs from theoretical and practical standpoints. We first present a near-optimal online algorithm for a general class of packing linear programs which model various online resource allocation problems including online variants of routing, ad allocations, generalized assignment, and combinatorial auctions. As our main theoretical result, we prove that a simple primal-dual training-based algorithm achieves a (1 - o(1))-approximation guarantee in the random order stochastic model. This is a significant improvement over logarithmic or constant-factor approximations for the adversarial variants of the same problems (e.g. factor 1 - 1/e for online ad allocation, and log m for online routing). We then focus on the online display ad allocation problem and study the efficiency and fairness of various training-based and online allocation algorithms on data sets collected from real-life display ad allocation system. Our experimental evaluation confirms the effectiveness of training-based primal-dual algorithms on real data sets, and also indicate an intrinsic trade-off between fairness and efficiency.',

	{'abstract': u'In the past few years we have witnessed the paradigm shift from static spectrum allocation to dynamic spectrum access/sharing. Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) is a promising mechanism to implement the agile spectrum access. However, in wireless distributed networks where tight synchronization is infeasible, OFDMA faces the problem of cross-band interference. Subcarriers used by different users are no longer orthogonal, and transmissions operating on non-overlapping subcarriers can interfere with each other. In this paper, we explore the cause of cross-band interference and analytically quantify its strength and impact on packet transmissions. Our analysis captures three key practical artifacts: inter-link frequency offset, temporal sampling mismatch and power heterogeneity. To our best knowledge, this work is the first to systematically analyze the cause and impact of cross-band interference. Using insights from our analysis, we then build and compared three mitigating methods to combat cross-band interference. Analytical and simulation results show that placing frequency guardband at link boundaries is the most effective solution in distributed spectrum sharing, while the other two frequency-domain methods are sensitive to either temporal sampling mismatch or inter-link frequency offset. We find that the proper guardband size depends heavily on power heterogeneity. Consequently, protocol designs for dynamic spectrum access should carefully take into account the cross-band interference when configuring spectrum usage.',

In this paper we study the stability of eps-kernels under dynamic insertion and deletion of points to P and by changing the approximation factor eps. In the first case, we say an algorithm for dynamically maintaining a eps-kernel is stable if at most O(1) points change in K as one point is inserted or deleted from P. We describe an algorithm to maintain an eps-kernel of size O(1/eps^) in O(1/eps^ + log n) time per update. Not only does our algorithm maintain a stable eps-kernel, its update time is faster than any known algorithm that maintains an eps-kernel of size O(1/eps^). Next, we show that if there is an eps-kernel of P of size k, which may be dramatically less than O(1/eps^), then there is an (eps/2)-kernel of P of size O(min , k^ log^ (1/eps)). Moreover, there exists a point set P in |R^d and a parameter eps &gt; 0 such that if every eps-kernel of P has size at least k, then any (eps/2)-kernel of P has size Omega(k^).',

	{'abstract': u'In this paper we develop algorithms for approximating matrix multiplication with respect to the spectral norm. Let A in and B in RR^ be two matrices and eps&gt;0. We approximate the product A^ top B using two down-sampled sketches, tilde in RR^ and tilde in RR^, where t ll n such that norm^ top tilde - A^ top B leq eps norm norm with high probability. We use two different sampling procedures for constructing tilde and tilde; one of them is done by i.i.d. non-uniform sampling rows from A and B and the other is done by taking random linear combinations of their rows. We prove bounds that depend only on the intrinsic dimensionality of A and B, that is their rank and their stable rank; namely the squared ratio between their Frobenius and operator norm. For achieving bounds that depend on rank we employ standard tools from high-dimensional geometry such as concentration of measure arguments combined with elaborate eps-net constructions. For bounds that depend on the smaller parameter of stable rank this technology itself seems weak. However, we show that in combination with a simple truncation argument is amenable to provide such bounds. To handle similar bounds for row sampling, we develop a novel matrix-valued Chernoff bound inequality which we call low rank matrix-valued Chernoff bound. Thanks to this inequality, we are able to give bounds that depend only on the stable rank of the input matrices...',

In this paper, with regards to essential properties of our specific problem, we consider the value function concept and will indicate that the optimum policy can be obtained by the method we offer without to be getting involved with computing of the complex value functions. Also, we will offer a normative behavioral model for the interaction of the agent with the musical pitch environment and by using a slightly different version of Partially observable Markov decision processes we will show that our method helps for faster learning of state-action pairs in our implemented agents.',

	{'abstract': u'Finding the sparse solution of an underdetermined system of linear equations has many applications, especially, it is used in Compressed Sensing (CS), Sparse Component Analysis (SCA), and sparse decomposition of signals on overcomplete dictionaries. We have recently proposed a fast algorithm, called Smoothed (SL0), for this task. Contrary to many other sparse recovery algorithms, SL0 is not based on minimizing the norm, but it tries to directly minimize the norm of the solution. The basic idea of SL0 is optimizing a sequence of certain (continuous) cost functions approximating the norm of a vector. However, in previous papers, we did not provide a complete convergence proof for SL0. In this paper, we study the convergence properties of SL0, and show that under a certain sparsity constraint in terms of Asymmetric Restricted Isometry Property (ARIP), and with a certain choice of parameters, the convergence of SL0 to the sparsest solution is guaranteed. Moreover, we study the complexity of SL0, and we show that whenever the dimension of the dictionary grows, the complexity of SL0 increases with the same order as Matching Pursuit (MP), which is one of the fastest existing sparse recovery methods, while contrary to MP, its convergence to the sparsest solution is guaranteed under certain conditions which are satisfied through the choice of parameters.',

	{'abstract': u'We introduce the notion of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of image gradient orientations. As image data is typically noisy, but noise is substantially different from Gaussian, traditional PCA of pixel intensities very often fails to estimate reliably the low-dimensional subspace of a given data population. We show that replacing intensities with gradient orientations and the norm with a cosine-based distance measure offers, to some extend, a remedy to this problem. Our scheme requires the eigen-decomposition of a covariance matrix and is as computationally efficient as standard PCA. We demonstrate some of its favorable properties on robust subspace estimation.',

	{'abstract': u'Introduction. The purpose of this work is the evaluation of responsiveness when remote users communicate with a human-readable knowledge base (KB). Responsiveness [R(s)] is considered here as a measure of service quality. Method. The preferred method is operational analysis, a variation of classical stochastic theory, which allows for the study of user-system interaction with minimal computational effort. Analysis. The analysis is based on well-known performance metrics, such as service ability, elapsed time, and throughput: from these metrics estimates of R(s) are derived analytically. Results. Critical points indicating congestion are obtained: these are limits on the number of admissible requests and the number of connected users. Also obtained is a sufficient condition for achieving flow balance between the KB host and the request-relaying servers. Conclusions. When R(s) is within normal limits, users should appreciate the benefits from using the services offered by their KB host. When bottlenecks are formed, R(s) declines, and the whole communication system heads for saturation. Flow balancing procedures are necessary for the elimination of bottlenecks, which leads to a better resource management.',

	{'abstract': u"This paper attempts to accurately model security requirements for computational grid environments with particular focus on authentication. We introduce the Audited Credential Delegation (ACD) architecture as a solution to some of the virtual organisations identity management usability problems. The approach uses two complementary models: one is state based, described in Z notation, and the other is event-based, expressed in the Process Algebra of Hoare's Communicating Sequential Processes (CSP). The former will be used to capture the state of the WS and to model back-end operations on it whereas the latter will be used to model behavior, and in particular, front-end interactions and communications. The modelling helps to clearly and precisely understand functional and security requirements and provide a basis for verifying that the system meets its intended requirements.",

	{'abstract': u'This paper presents multi-appearance fusion of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and generalization of Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) for multi-camera view offline face recognition (verification) system. The generalization of LDA has been extended to establish correlations between the face classes in the transformed representation and this is called canonical covariate. The proposed system uses Gabor filter banks for characterization of facial features by spatial frequency, spatial locality and orientation to make compensate to the variations of face instances occurred due to illumination, pose and facial expression changes. Convolution of Gabor filter bank to face images produces Gabor face representations with high dimensional feature vectors. PCA and canonical covariate are then applied on the Gabor face representations to reduce the high dimensional feature spaces into low dimensional Gabor eigenfaces and Gabor canonical faces. Reduced eigenface vector and canonical face vector are fused together using weighted mean fusion rule. Finally, support vector machines (SVM) have trained with augmented fused set of features and perform the recognition task. The system has been evaluated with UMIST face database consisting of multiview faces. The experimental results demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of the proposed system for multi-view face images with high recognition rates. Complexity analysis of the proposed system is also presented at the end of the experimental results.',

This class of multicast tree networks includes the class of diamond networks studied by Kang and Ulukus as a special case, where they showed that the capacity can be strictly lower than the cut-set bound. For achievablity, a novel coding scheme is constructed where each noisy relay employs a combination of decode-and-forward (DF) and compress-and-forward (CF) and each noiseless relay performs a random binning such that codebook constructions and relay operations are independent for each node and do not depend on the network topology. For converse, a new technique of iteratively manipulating inequalities exploiting the tree topology is used.',

The classical Independent Components Analysis (ICA) framework usually assumes linear combinations of independent sources over the field of realvalued numbers R. In this paper, we investigate binary ICA for OR mixtures (bICA), which can find applications in many domains including medical diagnosis, multi-cluster assignment, Internet tomography and network resource management. We prove that bICA is uniquely identifiable under the disjunctive generation model, and propose a deterministic iterative algorithm to determine the distribution of the latent random variables and the mixing matrix. The inverse problem concerning inferring the values of latent variables are also considered along with noisy measurements. We conduct an extensive simulation study to verify the effectiveness of the propose algorithm and present examples of real-world applications where bICA can be applied.',

We focus on a subclass of the problem with at most one fairness assumption for the specification. We then present a simulation-checking algorithm for this subclass. We propose simulation of a model by a specification against a common environment. We present efficient techniques for such simulations to take the common environment into consideration. Our experiment shows that such a consideration can dramatically improve the efficiency of checking simulation. We also report the performance of our algorithm in checking the liveness properties with fairness assumptions.',

	{'abstract': u"Courcelle's famous theorem from 1990 states that any property of graphs definable in monadic second-order logic (MSO) can be decided in linear time on any class of graphs of bounded treewidth, or in other words, MSO is fixed-parameter tractable in linear time on any such class of graphs. From a logical perspective, Courcelle's theorem establishes a sufficient condition, or an upper bound, for tractability of MSO-model checking. Whereas such upper bounds on the complexity of logics have received significant attention in the literature, almost nothing is known about corresponding lower bounds. In this paper we establish a strong lower bound for the complexity of monadic second-order logic. In particular, we show that if C is any class of graphs which is closed under taking subgraphs and whose treewidth is not bounded by a polylogarithmic function (in fact, for some small c suffices) then MSO-model checking is intractable on C (under a suitable assumption from complexity theory).",

	{'abstract': u'The Coherence Length Diagram and the related maps have been shown to represent a useful tool for image analysis. Setting threshold parameters is one of the most important issues when dealing with such applications, as they affect both the computability, which is outlined by the support map, and the appearance of the coherence length diagram itself and of defect maps. A coupled optimization analysis, returning a range for the basic (saturation) threshold, and a histogram based method, yielding suitable values for a desired map appearance, are proposed for an effective control of the analysis process.',

	{'abstract': u'To improve on existing models of interaction with a proof assistant (PA), in particular for storage and replay of proofs, we in- troduce three related concepts, those of: a proof movie, consisting of frames which record both user input and the corresponding PA response; a camera, which films a user\'s interactive session with a PA as a movie; and a proviola, which replays a movie frame-by-frame to a third party. In this paper we describe the movie data structure and we discuss a proto- type implementation of the camera and proviola based on the ProofWeb system. ProofWeb uncouples the interaction with a PA via a web- interface (the client) from the actual PA that resides on the server. Our camera films a movie by "listening" to the ProofWeb communication. The first reason for developing movies is to uncouple the reviewing of a formal proof from the PA used to develop it: the movie concept enables users to discuss small code fragments without the need to install the PA or to load a whole library into it. Other advantages include the possibility to develop a separate com- mentary track to discuss or explain the PA interaction. We assert that a combined camera+proviola provides a generic layer between a client (user) and a server (PA). Finally we claim that movies are the right type of data to be stored in an encyclopedia of formalized mathematics, based on our experience in filming the Coq standard library.',

	{'abstract': u'Streaming erasure codes guarantee that each source packet is recovered within a fixed delay at the receiver over a burst-erasure channel. This paper introduces a new class of streaming codes: Diversity Embedded Streaming Erasure Codes (DE-SCo), that provide a flexible tradeoff between the channel quality and receiver delay. When the channel conditions are good, the source stream is recovered with a low delay, whereas when the channel conditions are poor the source stream is still recovered, albeit with a larger delay. Information theoretic analysis of the underlying burst-erasure broadcast channel reveals that DE-SCo achieve the minimum possible delay for the weaker user, without sacrificing the single-user optimal performance of the stronger user. Our constructions are explicit, incur polynomial time encoding and decoding complexity and outperform random linear codes over burst-erasure channels.',

	{'abstract': u'Evolutionary economics has developed into an academic field of its own, institutionalized around, amongst others, the Journal of Evolutionary Economics (JEE). This paper analyzes the way and extent to which evolutionary economics has become an interdisciplinary journal, as its aim was: a journal that is indispensable in the exchange of expert knowledge on topics and using approaches that relate naturally with it. Analyzing citation data for the relevant academic field for the Journal of Evolutionary Economics, we use insights from scientometrics and social network analysis to find that, indeed, the JEE is a central player in this interdisciplinary field aiming mostly at understanding technological and regional dynamics. It does not, however, link firmly with the natural sciences (including biology) nor to management sciences, entrepreneurship, and organization studies. Another journal that could be perceived to have evolutionary acumen, the Journal of Economic Issues, does relate to heterodox economics journals and is relatively more involved in discussing issues of firm and industry organization. The JEE seems most keen to develop theoretical insights.',

	{'abstract': u"During the last three decades the Internet has experienced fascinating evolution, both exponential growth in traffic and rapid expansion in topology. The size of the Internet becomes enormous, yet the network is very `small' in the sense that it is extremely efficient to route data packets across the global Internet. This paper provides a brief review on three fundamental properties of the Internet topology at the autonomous systems (AS) level. Firstly the Internet has a power-law degree distribution, which means the majority of nodes on the Internet AS graph have small numbers of links, whereas a few nodes have very large numbers of links. Secondly the Internet exhibits a property called disassortative mixing, which means poorly-connected nodes tend to link with well-connected nodes, and vice versa. Thirdly the best-connected nodes, or the rich nodes, are tightly interconnected with each other forming a rich-club. We explain that it is these structural properties that make the global Internet so 'small'.",
